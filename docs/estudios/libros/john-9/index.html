Jhn 9:1** </a> As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.<code> this man's day started out begging like he had always done since he was little</code></p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.2"><strong>Jhn 9:2</strong> </a> And His disciples asked Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?&rdquo; ``` the understanding</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.3"><strong>Jhn 9:3</strong> </a> Jesus answered, &ldquo;<em>It was</em> neither <em>that</em> this man sinned, nor his parents; but <em>it was</em> so that the works of God might be displayed in him.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.4"><strong>Jhn 9:4</strong> </a> &ldquo;We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.5"><strong>Jhn 9:5</strong> </a> &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.6"><strong>Jhn 9:6</strong> </a> When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes,</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.7"><strong>Jhn 9:7</strong> </a> and said to him, &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of Siloam&rdquo; (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came <em>back</em> seeing.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.8"><strong>Jhn 9:8</strong> </a> Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, &ldquo;Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.9"><strong>Jhn 9:9</strong> </a> Others were saying, &ldquo;This is he,&rdquo; <em>still</em> others were saying, &ldquo;No, but he is like him.&rdquo; He kept saying, &ldquo;I am the one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.10"><strong>Jhn 9:10</strong> </a> So they were saying to him, &ldquo;How then were your eyes opened?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.11"><strong>Jhn 9:11</strong> </a> He answered, &ldquo;The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, &lsquo;Go to Siloam and wash&rsquo;; so I went away and washed, and I received sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.12"><strong>Jhn 9:12</strong> </a> They said to him, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo; He *said, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.13"><strong>Jhn 9:13</strong> </a> They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.14"><strong>Jhn 9:14</strong> </a> Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.15"><strong>Jhn 9:15</strong> </a> Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, &ldquo;He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.16"><strong>Jhn 9:16</strong> </a> Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, &ldquo;This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.&rdquo; But others were saying, &ldquo;How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?&rdquo; And there was a division among them.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.17"><strong>Jhn 9:17</strong> </a> So they *said to the blind man again, &ldquo;What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;He is a prophet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.18"><strong>Jhn 9:18</strong> </a> The Jews then did not believe <em>it</em> of him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.19"><strong>Jhn 9:19</strong> </a> and questioned them, saying, &ldquo;Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.20"><strong>Jhn 9:20</strong> </a> His parents answered them and said, &ldquo;We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.21"><strong>Jhn 9:21</strong> </a> but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.22"><strong>Jhn 9:22</strong> </a> His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.23"><strong>Jhn 9:23</strong> </a> For this reason his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age; ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.24"><strong>Jhn 9:24</strong> </a> So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, &ldquo;Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.25"><strong>Jhn 9:25</strong> </a> He then answered, &ldquo;Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>Do you think the blind man said...'bah i wonder why i've been blind my whole life. I wonder how that man healed me?....NO! He says, all i know is I was blind but now I see.</code></p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.26"><strong>Jhn 9:26</strong> </a> So they said to him, &ldquo;What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.27"><strong>Jhn 9:27</strong> </a> He answered them, &ldquo;I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear <em>it</em> again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.28"><strong>Jhn 9:28</strong> </a> They reviled him and said, &ldquo;You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.29"><strong>Jhn 9:29</strong> </a> &ldquo;We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.30"><strong>Jhn 9:30</strong> </a> The man answered and said to them, &ldquo;Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and <em>yet</em> He opened my eyes.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.31"><strong>Jhn 9:31</strong> </a> &ldquo;We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.32"><strong>Jhn 9:32</strong> </a> &ldquo;Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.33"><strong>Jhn 9:33</strong> </a> &ldquo;If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.34"><strong>Jhn 9:34</strong> </a> They answered him, &ldquo;You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?&rdquo; So they put him out.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.35"><strong>Jhn 9:35</strong> </a> Jesus heard that they had put him out, <code> The religious leaders put him out</code>and finding him, <code> Jesus in turn looked for him and accepted him</code> He said, &ldquo;Do you believe in the Son of Man?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.36"><strong>Jhn 9:36</strong> </a> He answered, &ldquo;Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.37"><strong>Jhn 9:37</strong> </a> Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.38"><strong>Jhn 9:38</strong> </a> And he said, &ldquo;Lord, I believe.&rdquo; And he worshiped Him.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.39"><strong>Jhn 9:39</strong> </a> And Jesus said, &ldquo;For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.40"><strong>Jhn 9:40</strong> </a> Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, &ldquo;We are not blind too, are we?&rdquo; <code> Matt 23</code></p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.9.41"><strong>Jhn 9:41</strong> </a> Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, &lsquo;We see,&rsquo; your sin remains.</p>
