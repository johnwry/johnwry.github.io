<h2 id="when-were-angels-created">When were angels created?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For by Him <strong>all things were created</strong>, <em>both</em> in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and fo
Thus <strong>the heavens</strong> and the earth were completed, and <strong>all their hosts</strong>. Gen 2:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Angels were created by God. The question is when?</p>
<p>My contention is that the angels <strong>had</strong> to be created during the six days although the Bible doesn&rsquo;t say explicitly which day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For <strong>in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth</strong>, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy. Ex 20:11</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucifer is said to have been created on a day&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You were blameless in your ways <strong>From the day you were created</strong> Until unrighteousness was found in you. Ezekiel 28:15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say the angels were created before the six says clearly goes directly against Exodus 20:11.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For in six days the LORD made <strong>the heavens</strong> and the earth, the sea and <strong>all that is in them</strong>, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole point of resting on day 7 (a literal day) is because God created everything in heaven and on earth in six literal days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; <em>in it</em> you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. Exodus 20:10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse that people use to say angels were already created before day one is in Job 38.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell <em>Me,</em> if you have understanding, who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the line on it? &ldquo;On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone, <strong>when the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy</strong>? Job 38:4-7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>foundation of the earth</em> could be understood as the whole week of creation as Genesis 2 concludes the earth was created in a day (a period of time).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, <strong>in the day</strong> that the LORD God made earth and heaven. Gen 2:4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The foundation of the earth could easily refer to a period of time not the specific forming of the earth&rsquo;s matter on day one or the appearing of dry land on day three.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then God said, &ldquo;Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and <strong>let the dry land appear</strong>&rdquo;; and it was so. Genesis 1:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Job passage could be a reference to the angels observing the appearing of dry land on day three or seeing the creation of the earth&rsquo;s matter in day one. Either would fit perfectly.</p>
<p>It would seem best to conclude that angels were created on or after day one but no later than day three with the appearing of dry land.</p>
<h2 id="when-did-the-angels-fall">When did the angels fall?</h2>
<p>First off, at least Lucifer still has access to heaven. He will not be prohibited all access until during the Tribulation. But, when did the angels rebel against God? Was it before man sinned? Was it after or was at the same point in time?</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that death came into the world when Adam sinned not when Lucifer rebelled. There was not death before Adam&rsquo;s sin.</p>
