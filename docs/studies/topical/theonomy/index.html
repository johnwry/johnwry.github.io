<p>What is theonomy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>theonomy</strong> -mē\ <em>noun</em>
[German <em>Theonomie</em>, from <em>theo-</em> the- (from Latin) + <em>-nomie</em> -nomy] 1890:the state of being theonomous: government by God <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s definition seems simple enough, it does not define modern theonomy.</p>
<p>Ryrie explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much confusion exists because of the failure to carefully define, distinguish, and compare the church and the kingdom. Based on Augustine’s <em>City of God</em>, the equation of the church and the kingdom resulted in the absolute authority of the church on earth. Postmillennialism builds the earthly kingdom on the growth and success of the church. <strong>The mistaken concept of theonomy sees the church’s mission as establishing the Old Testament Law of God in the kingdoms of the world today</strong>. Reformed theology, less frontal than theonomy, builds on the concept of the lordship of Christ over all the structures of the world and sees the church as a principal agent in accomplishing this. What is the relation between the church and the kingdom?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theonomists reconstructionists and are mostly postmillenials and some millennials</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash; POSTMILLENNIALISM &ndash;
This view would also not support a literal 1,000 year reign of Christ on earth. The kingdom of Christ is viewed as already present and He reigns through His church. Unlike Amillennial- ism and Premillennialism, Post Millennialism believes that the spread of the gospel will lead to a gradual “Christianization” of the world which will bring about a golden age of peace and harmony prior to the second coming. Christ will return to the earth for His own and to then judge the unbelievers only after this golden age has been realized. This view also sees conversion as the first resurrection and the Great White Throne judgement as the second resurrection. The 20th and now 21st century have brought many fatal blows to this view yet it is on the rise again in various forms such as Liberation Theology, Kingdom Theology (Re constructionism) and Theonomy. Both amillennialism and post millennialism deny any future for national Israel as part of God’s unfolding plan. Certain texts or phrases are extracted from New Testament passages to support the idea that the true Israel is made up of Jew and Gentile and all current and future prophecies are meant to be for both Jew and Gentile within the church.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ryrie goes on&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theonomists promote subduing the earth by means of science, education, the arts, and all other pursuits in order to effect God’s dominion over all things. <strong>For some, this means imposing the Law of the Old Testament on life today not only in moral matters but also in governmental, financial, and other areas</strong>. Now, of course, if this is done, conditions in the world will improve and we will then experience the rule of God over life in the world. Thus, many Reformed theologians who strongly support the use of the Law and who were amillennial have switched to embrace postmillennialism as the goal of their theonomistic program. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Constable states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reconstructionists anticipate a day when Christians will govern using the Old Testament as the law book&rdquo; Reconstructionism rests on presuppositional apologetics, theonomy (lit. the rule of God), and postmillennialism. Other names for it are the &ldquo;theonomy movement&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Chalcedon school.&rdquo; It has gained many followers, many among charismatic evangelicals. Its popular appeal is that it claims God wants America, and every other nation, to function as God intended Israel to function, namely, as a theocracy. It fails to make a distinction, however, between God&rsquo;s unique purpose for Israel and His purpose for other nations throughout history.</p>

<h2 id="verses-to-consider">Verses to consider</h2>
<h3 id="verses-to-explain"><strong>Verses to Explain</strong></h3>
<p>1Timothy 1:8-11  <em>But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully, realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching, according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</em></p>
<p>So, there is an appropriate use of the law and that is for the unjust. I suppose one could argue that this is referring to teaching the world the law to conform, but the context is talking about the wrongful teaching of the law that was taking place to the church (the just). So the focus of the passage is about correcting the misuse of using the law in the church and stating the law is meant for the unsaved to be lead to Christ. These verses do not support theonomy.</p>
<h3 id="verses-that-clarify-the-church-in-regards-to-theonomy"><strong>Verses that Clarify the Church in regards to Theonomy</strong></h3>
<p>Jesus never encouraged His disciples to take civil action in His defense.
John 18:36 <em>Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world, then <strong>My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews</strong>; but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In the church, grace is to reign not law:
Romans 5:20-21  <em>The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned</em> [through the law] <em>in death, even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</em></p>
<p>1 Corinthians 5:12 <em>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Do you not judge those who are within the church?</em></p>
