      <description>Angels# When were angels created?# For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and fo Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. Gen 2:1
Angels were created by God. The question is when?
My contention is that the angels had to be created during the six days although the Bible doesn&amp;rsquo;t say explicitly which day.</description>

      <description>My notes on Armageddon# Where does Armageddon come from?
It is a Greek translation of har-megiddo
Har means hill or mountain.
the the Valley of Jezreel is what lies near
HISTORY
Megiddo controlled a narrow strategic stretch of road called the Via Maris, &amp;ldquo;the Way of the Sea,&amp;rdquo; a major international highway in the ancient world. This road stretched from Egypt in the south to Babylon in Mesopotamia, linking the major empires and trade routes of the day.</description>

      <description>Biblical Convenants# Establishing a preliminary understanding# In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the biblical covenants, we will take a step back and see the general usage and importance of the term &amp;ldquo;covenant&amp;rdquo;.# Although we have many external sources (i.e. dictionaries, archaeological data, lexicons, historical records) that help us acquire a better understanding, we will not go to those first.# 2. A Scriptural principle: If the topic is to be considered important within the teaching of Scripture, the Bible will provide us sufficient usage and background to gain a sufficient understanding of that particular topic.</description>

      <description>Confession of Sins# What the Scripture teaches# Spiritual Separation# Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo; Genesis 3:9
Relational Separation# While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion can.# When is fellowship broken between the believer and God?# 2Co 6:14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?</description>

      <description>Discipleship# The Importance# Have you ever wondering why the apostle Paul writes an explanation of the Gospel to believers in Rome? Why does Paul clarify the Gospel to the Corinthian saints? Why would Paul defend the Gospel to the Galatian church? It seems redundant to waste words teaching the Gospel to believers.
I was once laughed at for articulating the Gospel to a family who was interested in our ministry. I tried to impress on them the need we saw of clarifying the Gospel to people in this generation.</description>

      <description>EKKLESIA = called out, called
Two other words in the ekklesia family are found in the Septuagint that are not in the New Testament: ekklesiazo the verb form “to call an ekklesia” and ekklesiastes the noun of agency “one who speaks to the ekklesia.”
ἐκκλησία G1577 in LXX# Deuteronomy 4:10 - on the day of the ekklesia. On this occasion God commanded Moses to “gather [the verb form of ekklesia] the people before Me”</description>

      <description>Globalism and Theology# &amp;gt;Theological Elements in Globalism
&amp;gt;Foundational Questions: Globalism’s underlying vision is rooted in foundational questions about God’s existence, His role in the universe, good and evil, life and death, and the meaning of salvation. This theological nature of globalism must be considered in any serious examination of globalization.
&amp;gt;Alternative to Christianity: Globalism presents an alternative to Christianity, with its own vision of the kingdom of Heaven realized in the current age.</description>
