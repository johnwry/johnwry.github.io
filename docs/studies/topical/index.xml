      <description>Often missed:
5:1–11 forms a complete discourse unit 5:12–21 is a single chiastic comparison 7:1–6 forms a self-contained analogy → application → explanation 8:1–4 is a tightly connected chain, not four separate statements ====
ANALOGÍA (7:1-3) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 7:1 [¿No saben] [hermanos] [pues hablo con los que conocen la ley] → [que la ley tiene jurisdicción sobre el hombre] [mientras viva]? 7:2 PORQUE [la mujer casada] [está sujeta por la ley] [a su esposo] [mientras viva] PERO [si su esposo muere] → [queda libre] [de la ley del esposo].</description>

      <description>Sanctification is the process of being set apart for God’s purpose and becoming more like Christ. It is a fundamental aspect of the Christian life, and it is empowered by the gospel.
The Gospel is about redemption: The Gospel is the means by which God justifies us. The Gospel is the foundation of Sanctification: The Gospel is the foundation of sanctification because by the power of the Gospel we are declared righteous.</description>

      <description>1Pe 4:1 Therefore, Christ having suffered for us in the flesh, also you arm yourselves with the same thought, because he having suffered in the flesh has been made to rest from sin,
1Pe 4:2 for him no longer to live in the lusts of men, but to live the remaining time in the flesh in the will of God.
1Pe 4:3 For the time of life having passed is sufficient for us to have worked out the will of the nations, having gone on in wantonness, lusts, drunkenness, parties, carousings, and lawless idolatries;</description>

      <description>Angels# When were angels created?# For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and fo Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. Gen 2:1
Angels were created by God. The question is when?
My contention is that the angels had to be created during the six days although the Bible doesn&amp;rsquo;t say explicitly which day.</description>

      <description>My notes on Armageddon# Where does Armageddon come from?
It is a Greek translation of har-megiddo
Har means hill or mountain.
the the Valley of Jezreel is what lies near
HISTORY
Megiddo controlled a narrow strategic stretch of road called the Via Maris, &amp;ldquo;the Way of the Sea,&amp;rdquo; a major international highway in the ancient world. This road stretched from Egypt in the south to Babylon in Mesopotamia, linking the major empires and trade routes of the day.</description>

      <description>Biblical Convenants# Establishing a preliminary understanding# In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the biblical covenants, we will take a step back and see the general usage and importance of the term &amp;ldquo;covenant&amp;rdquo;.# Although we have many external sources (i.e. dictionaries, archaeological data, lexicons, historical records) that help us acquire a better understanding, we will not go to those first.# 2. A Scriptural principle: If the topic is to be considered important within the teaching of Scripture, the Bible will provide us sufficient usage and background to gain a sufficient understanding of that particular topic.</description>

      <description>Confession of Sins# What the Scripture teaches# Spiritual Separation# Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, &amp;ldquo;Where are you?&amp;rdquo; Genesis 3:9
Relational Separation# While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion can.# When is fellowship broken between the believer and God?# 2Co 6:14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?</description>
