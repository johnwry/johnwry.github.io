What Is the Church?
It&amp;rsquo;s Role and Purpose According to the Bible “Church” is the translation of the Greek term ekklesia, and is used in the New Testament to identify the community of believers in Jesus Christ. It literally means “assembly,” “congregation,” or “meeting.” A similar term was used in the Old Testament referring to experiences such as “the day of the assembly,” “the Lord’s congregation,” or “meeting before the Lord.</description>

      <description>Angels# When were angels created?# For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and fo Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. Gen 2:1
Angels were created by God. The question is when?
My contention is that the angels had to be created during the six days although the Bible doesn&amp;rsquo;t say explicitly which day.</description>

      <description>My notes on Armageddon# Where does Armageddon come from?
It is a Greek translation of har-megiddo
Har means hill or mountain.
the the Valley of Jezreel is what lies near
HISTORY
Megiddo controlled a narrow strategic stretch of road called the Via Maris, &amp;ldquo;the Way of the Sea,&amp;rdquo; a major international highway in the ancient world. This road stretched from Egypt in the south to Babylon in Mesopotamia, linking the major empires and trade routes of the day.</description>

      <description>Biblical Convenants# Establishing a preliminary understanding# In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the biblical covenants, we will take a step back and see the general usage and importance of the term &amp;ldquo;covenant&amp;rdquo;.# Although we have many external sources (i.e. dictionaries, archaeological data, lexicons, historical records) that help us acquire a better understanding, we will not go to those first.# 2. A Scriptural principle: If the topic is to be considered important within the teaching of Scripture, the Bible will provide us sufficient usage and background to gain a sufficient understanding of that particular topic.</description>

Relational Separation# While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion can.# When is fellowship broken between the believer and God?# 2Co 6:14 Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?</description>

      <description>Daniel# Chapter 6 ends the historical section Darius had no alternative but to enforce the law he&amp;rsquo;d been tricked to make. This was the law of the Medes and the Persians. No one could revoke this law. Yet, they will learn, there is one who is sovereign over men who is above any Medo-Persian law. Daniel 6:18 Darius&amp;rsquo;s Sleepless night# Daniel 6:18# Dan 6:18 Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.</description>

      <description>This is the account of Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s Image - False Worship
Man by default is religious. He will bow to something. God created man in his image. Mankind creates gods in their image. Romans 1:18-32
Worshipping God in our own way is also adultery.
Even though we might not bow down to any statue we can &amp;lsquo;bow&amp;rsquo; to gods in our hearts and minds.
Why did Nebuchadnezzar build this image? He was thinking about this since God spoke to him in the dream and visions, except he distorted it to his own benefit.</description>
