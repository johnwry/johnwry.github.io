      <description>Discipleship# The Importance# Have you ever wondering why the apostle Paul writes an explanation of the Gospel to believers in Rome? Why does Paul clarify the Gospel to the Corinthian saints? Why would Paul defend the Gospel to the Galatian church? It seems redundant to waste words teaching the Gospel to believers.
I was once laughed at for articulating the Gospel to a family who was interested in our ministry. I tried to impress on them the need we saw of clarifying the Gospel to people in this generation.</description>
