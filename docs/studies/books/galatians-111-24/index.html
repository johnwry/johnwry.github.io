        <p><a href="verseid:48.1.11"><strong>Gal 1:11</strong> </a> For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.12"><strong>Gal 1:12</strong> </a> For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but <em>I received it</em> through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.13"><strong>Gal 1:13</strong> </a> For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.14"><strong>Gal 1:14</strong> </a> and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.15"><strong>Gal 1:15</strong> </a> But when God, who had set me apart <em>even</em> from my mother&rsquo;s womb and called me through His grace, was pleased</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.16"><strong>Gal 1:16</strong> </a> to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.17"><strong>Gal 1:17</strong> </a> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.18"><strong>Gal 1:18</strong> </a> Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.19"><strong>Gal 1:19</strong> </a> But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.20"><strong>Gal 1:20</strong> </a> (Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.21"><strong>Gal 1:21</strong> </a> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.22"><strong>Gal 1:22</strong> </a> I was <em>still</em> unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.23"><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> </a> but only, they kept hearing, &ldquo;He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:48.1.24"><strong>Gal 1:24</strong> </a> And they were glorifying God because of me.</p>
