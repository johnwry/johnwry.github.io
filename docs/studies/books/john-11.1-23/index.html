        <p>Joh 11:1  Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
Joh 11:2  It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
Joh 11:3  So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, &ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&rdquo;
Joh 11:4  But when Jesus heard this, He said, &ldquo;This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.&rdquo;
Joh 11:5  Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
Joh 11:6  So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was.
Joh 11:7  Then after this He *said to the disciples, &ldquo;Let us go to Judea again.&rdquo;
Joh 11:8  The disciples *said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?&rdquo;
Joh 11:9  Jesus answered, &ldquo;Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
Joh 11:10  &ldquo;But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.&rdquo;
Joh 11:11  This He said, and after that He *said to them, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep.&rdquo;
Joh 11:12  The disciples then said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.&rdquo;
Joh 11:13  Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep.
Joh 11:14  So Jesus then said to them plainly, &ldquo;Lazarus is dead,
Joh 11:15  and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.&rdquo;
Joh 11:16  Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, &ldquo;Let us also go, so that we may die with Him.&rdquo;
I Am the Resurrection and the Life</p>
<p>Joh 11:17  So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
Joh 11:18  Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;
Joh 11:19  and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
Joh 11:20  Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house.
Joh 11:21  Martha then said to Jesus, &ldquo;Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
Joh 11:22  &ldquo;Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.&rdquo;
Joh 11:23  Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;Your brother will rise again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>===
Now a certain man was sick,
Lazarus</p>
<p>​				of Bethany,
​						the village of Mary</p>
<p>​								and her sister Martha.
​						It was the Mary
​											who anointed the Lord</p>
<p>​												with ointment,

<p>​													with her hair,
​						whose brother Lazarus was sick.
​			So the sisters sent word to Him, saying,
​					&ldquo;Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.&rdquo;
​			But when Jesus heard this, He said,
​			&ldquo;This sickness is not to end in death,
​				but for the glory of God,
​										so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.&rdquo;
​		Now Jesus loved Martha
​			and her sister
​			and Lazarus.
​		So when He heard that he was sick,
​			He then stayed two days longer</p>
<p>​				in the place where He was.
​		Then after this He *said to the disciples,

​			The disciples *said to Him,
​			&ldquo;Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You,

​					because the light is not in him.&rdquo;
​		This He said,
​			and after that He *said to them,
​			&ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep;
​			but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep.&rdquo;
​		The disciples then said to Him,
