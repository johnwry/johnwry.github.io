<p><a href="verseid:43.8.33"><strong>Joh 8:33</strong> </a> They answered Him, &ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, &lsquo;You will become free&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.34"><strong>Joh 8:34</strong> </a> Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.35"><strong>Joh 8:35</strong> </a> &ldquo;The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.36"><strong>Joh 8:36</strong> </a> &ldquo;So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.37"><strong>Joh 8:37</strong> </a> &ldquo;I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants; yet you seek to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.38"><strong>Joh 8:38</strong> </a> &ldquo;I speak the things which I have seen with <em>My</em> Father; therefore you also do the things which you heard from <em>your</em> father.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="you-are-of-your-father-the-devil">You Are of Your Father the Devil</h2>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.39"><strong>Joh 8:39</strong> </a> They answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo; Jesus *said to them, &ldquo;If you are Abraham&rsquo;s children, do the deeds of Abraham.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.40"><strong>Joh 8:40</strong> </a> &ldquo;But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.41"><strong>Joh 8:41</strong> </a> &ldquo;You are doing the deeds of your father.&rdquo; They said to Him, &ldquo;We were not born of fornication; we have one Father: God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.42"><strong>Joh 8:42</strong> </a> Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God, for I have not even come on My own initiative, but He sent Me.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.43"><strong>Joh 8:43</strong> </a> &ldquo;Why do you not understand what I am saying? <em>It is</em> because you cannot hear My word.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.8.44"><strong>Joh 8:44</strong> </a> &ldquo;You are of <em>your</em> father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own <em>nature,</em> for he is a liar and the father of lies.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>So Jesus was saying to those Jews</p>
<p>​	who had believed Him,</p>
<p>​		&ldquo;If you continue in My word,</p>
<p>​			then* you are truly disciples of Mine;</p>
<p>​				and you will know the truth,</p>
<p>​					and the truth will make you free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They answered Him,</p>
<p>​	&ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants</p>
<p>​	and have never yet been enslaved to anyone;</p>
<p>​	how is it that You say,</p>
<p>​	&lsquo;You will become free&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus answered them,</p>
<p>​	&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you,</p>
<p>​	everyone</p>
<p>​		who commits sin</p>
<p>​			is the slave of sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>​	The slave does not remain in the house forever;</p>
<p>​	the son does remain forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>​	So if the Son makes you free,</p>
<p>​	you will be free indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants;</p>
<p>yet you seek to kill Me,</p>
<p>​	because My word has no place in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I speak the things</p>
<p>which I have seen with <em>My</em> Father;</p>
<p>therefore you also do the things</p>
<p>which you heard from <em>your</em> father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They answered and said to Him,</p>
<p>​	&ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus said to them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are Abraham&rsquo;s children,</p>
<p>do the deeds of Abraham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me,</p>
<p>​		a man who has told you the truth,</p>
<p>​			which I heard from God;</p>
<p>​			this Abraham did not do.</p>
<p>​	&ldquo;You are doing the deeds of your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said to Him,</p>
<p>​	&ldquo;We were not born of fornication;</p>
<p>​	we have one Father: God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="jesus-is-the-perfect-representation-of-his-father">Jesus is the perfect representation of his father</h2>
<p>Jesus said to them,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God were your Father,</p>
<p>you would love Me,</p>
<p>for I proceeded forth</p>

<p>Why do you not understand what I am saying?</p>
<p><em>It is</em> because you cannot hear My word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are of <em>your</em> father the devil,</p>
<p>and you want to do the desires of your father.</p>
<p>He was a murderer from the beginning,</p>
<p>and does not stand in the truth</p>
<p>because there is no truth in him.</p>
<p>Whenever he speaks a lie,</p>
<p>he speaks from his own <em>nature,</em></p>
