<p><strong>Zechariah</strong>
<strong>Return to Me!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A prodigal nation comes home</strong></p>
<p><em>Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time</em></p>
<p>Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be&hellip;for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15</p>
<p>We know there are certain books in the Bible that are not as popular as others. Quite possibly however, the most underestimated of them all lies tucked away between the major prophets and the gospels. It lies quietly, just waiting to be explored.</p>
<p>That has been our experience as we have visited the book of Zechariah.  We spent countless hours in the presence of Zechariah, allow him to speak for himself and allow the Holy Spirit’s teaching to grant us understanding into what the most Messianic, most apocalyptic and most eschatological book in the Old Testament may well be. As if that was not enough, the main thread joining the book is a true story of love, deep with affections that Yahweh Sabaoth has for a wayward people and how they respond to Hi</p>
<p>There is no telling what God might reveal to you about Himself and His affections towards you in this short book! May God use this study to grow you deeper in your understanding of the affections God has prepared for you. Our prayer is that you as you walk with Zechariah through this epic narrative, you’ll come to see Judah’s need for Him, God’s solution for them and the ultimate reunion of reunions when at last they return with all their heart to the Lord!</p>
<p>The illustrations Zechariah brings out in this book are enlightening and convicting! He has a list of appropriate examples from among the people to help show the reality of their spiritual condition. Returnees who never returned, people who mourned without knowing why, a high priest before God in filthy clothes, fleecing shepherd and blind sheep following a worthless shepherd, are only some of the illustrations contained in this little-known book.</p>
<p>Zechariah is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out and some of the details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.</p>
<p>The narrative of Zechariah shows how God tirelessly protects His nation form extinction while she (also tirelessly) commits spiritual adultery with the gods of the nations. God is greater than the greatest evil. His plans are from everlasting. He provisioned the means, by giving His own son, so that she can be redeemed and forgiven. However, when His Son came, she decided she did not like him and has Him crucified. Zechariah makes it clear, God’s offer still stands…<em>return to me</em>…<em>I will return</em> (come again) <em>to you</em>!</p>
<p>You are about to embark on the magnificent account of the ages of a prodigal nation who wanders endlessly and of a loving Father who waits tirelessly until his son, yes, his dear son, comes home at last. This book is bound to encourage you as it was intended for the generation of Zechariah, to a real, intimate fellowship with God.</p>
<p>God reveals His will, He calls people back to Himself and provides the way for their coming, and He promises that if they return to Him, He will return to them.</p>

Election has to do with Gods choice for purpose, not destiny. God chose Israel to be a light, to be the ethnicity of the Savior, to be the keeper of the Old Testament Scriptures, and so much more.
An Israelite must believe to be delivered from hell.

The New Covenant promises have not been fulfilled. The Church program has not replaced God&rsquo;s program for Israel. God&rsquo;s promises must be fulfilled with the nation of Israel in order to fulfill the many prophecies and, &ldquo;then you will know I am the Lord&rdquo;.</p>

 Charles Feinberg - Wickedness, furthermore, will not find it difficult to adjust itself there, for Babylon is her own place. It is to abide where it originated and where it has always belonged. The cycle of wickedness, as it were, is complete. Godlessness in every form has finally come home.</p>
<p>[<a

    class="is-pretty-link">26]</a

 John F. Walvoord The predictions of Isaiah have to do with Babylon’s ultimate destruction in the Day of the Lord. The near and the far view are often mingled as in chapter 13. The destruction of Babylon is pictured in Isaiah 13:1-11 as part of God’s program to punish the entire world (cp. 13:11). The historic conquering of Babylon by the Medes and the Persians is mentioned specifically in Isaiah 13:17-19 The prophet seems to refer to the far view, that is, the destruction of Babylon in relation to the second coming of Christ. Isaiah 13:20-22.</p>
<p>[<a

    class="is-pretty-link">27]</a

 John F. Walvoord the prophecies of Jeremiah are notable because they were delivered at the peak of Babylon’s power when it seemed most unlikely that the great nation would fall. Babylon is pictured as being punished because of its cruel treatment of Israel (50:17, 18; 51:24, 49).Practically all of the predictions of Jeremiah seem to relate to the fall of Babylon by the attack of the Medes and the Persians. Only occasionally does there seem to be a reference to a future ultimate destruction as in Jeremiah 51:62-64. The prophecies of Jeremiah predicting the fall of Babylon at the hands of the Medes and the Persians were graphically fulfilled approximately sixty-five years later, as recorded in Daniel 5</p>

 Josephus <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em> 14:62 - After three months, Pompey&rsquo;s troops finally managed to overthrow one of the Baris towers and were able to enter the Temple precinct, both from the citadel and from the west. First over the wall was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, the son of the former dictator and a senior officer in Pompey&rsquo;s army. He was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, who each led a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews, 12,000 of whom were slaughtered. However, only a few Romans troops were killed. Pompey himself entered the Temple&rsquo;s Holy of Holies, which only the High Priest was allowed to enter, and thus desecrated it. He did not remove anything, neither its treasures nor any funds, and the next day, he ordered the Temple cleansed and its rituals resumed. Pompey then headed back to Rome and took Aristobulus with him for his triumphal procession.</p>

 Utley, Bob <em>The Old Testament Apocalypses Daniel and Zechariah</em> - This verse has been extremely difficult for the rabbis to interpret. Therefore, they developed from this verse the concept of two Messiahs; one of the son of David and one of the son of Joseph, who was going to die (cf. the Babylonian Talmud, Sukkah, 52a). This same theory also appears among the Essenes of the Dead Sea community. The modern translators of the Jewish Publication Society of America turn this verse into a lament by Israel to God to spare the remnant of the invading nations, but admits in the footnote that the Hebrew is uncertain.</p>

 Andy Woods - Audio Series on Zechariah #33 - Kingdom Condition - There&rsquo;s a chunk of real estate that the world community thinks if Israel just relinquishes this, peace would break out all over the Middle East. It&rsquo;s a dispute of a territory that they call the West Bank&hellip;Why is it called the &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; when God says it&rsquo;s in the east?&hellip;When you use the expression &ldquo;West Bank&rdquo; you&rsquo;re using a Jordanian mindset. Because that land is west of Jordan, but as far as God&rsquo;s geography is concerned that&rsquo;s not the west bank at all.That&rsquo;s in the east. IN fact, the expression west bank you will not find it a single time in the Bible&hellip;</p>
