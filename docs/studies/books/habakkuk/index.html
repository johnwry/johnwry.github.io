<h2 id="h1">Habakkuk Asks God</h2>
<pre><code> 1 The pronouncement which Habakkuk the prophet saw:
</code></pre>
<p><code>Habakkuk is a contemporary to Jeremiah, Zephaniah and probably lives during or soon after Josiah as king. All of these men are young.</code></p>
<pre><code> 2. How long, Lord, have I called for help, 
 And You do not hear?
</code></pre>
<p><code>Habakkuk's complaint is that God is not listening </code></p>
<pre><code>I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save.
</code></pre>
<p><code>Violence! And you don't do anything!? This may be a clue as to the time period. Perhaps it fits best after king Josiah when Jehoiakim (puppet king) is placed as king by Egypt. He was a very bad king (Jer 36). Gave taxes to Egypt and had the prophet Uriah killed (Jer 26:21-24).</code></p>
<pre><code>3 Why do You make me see disaster, 
And make *me* look at destitution? 
Yes, devastation and violence are before me;
</code></pre>
<p><code>Habakkuk seems to be blaming God for these circumstances-YOU make me see, YOU make me look. Perhaps Habakkuk saw what influence Nahum and Zephaniah had on young king Josiah yet Habakkuk evidently has a very hard time with Jehoiakim. Jeremiah, a contemporary is already under caution. Jer 22:17. Jehoiakim burns a part of Jeremiah's scroll (Jer 26:20-23) </code></p>
<pre><code>Strife exists and contention arises.
</code></pre>
<p><code>The world system and lack of justice really can get frustrating.</code></p>
<pre><code>4 Therefore the Law is ignored, And justice is never upheld.
     For the wicked surround the righteous;
         Therefore justice comes out confused.
</code></pre>
<p><code>Habakkuk seems to blame the lack of justice because of strife and contention. Since the wicked surround the righteous, the law is ignored, justice is never upheld. </code></p>
<h2 id="hII">God Responds</h2>
<pre><code>5 “Look among the nations! 
</code></pre>
<p><code>Habakkuk is invited to look outside of his 4 walls to see God was still in charge.</code></p>
<pre><code>Watch! Be horrified! 

Be frightened speechless! For I am accomplishing a work 
</code></pre>
<p><code>It was ongoing, God was already in the process</code></p>
<pre><code>in your days—You would not believe it even if you were told!
</code></pre>
<p><code>It was so extraordinary, it was unbelievable</code></p>
<pre><code>6 For behold, 
    I am raising up the Chaldeans,
</code></pre>
<p><code>This is ironic. Is God 'teaming up' with the evil Chaldeans? Up to this point, the Chaldeans weren't a super power. This had been prophecied: Isa 23:13, Deut 28:49-57 </code></p>
<pre><code>        That grim and impetuous people 
</code></pre>
<p><code>grim and impetuous is just the opposite to who God is</code></p>
<pre><code>            Who march throughout the earth, 
                To take possession of dwelling places that are not theirs.
</code></pre>
<p><code>These aren't people who stick to their own. They go where others dwell and rob it. Bullies </code></p>
<pre><code>7 They are terrifying and feared;
</code></pre>
<p><code>What was known of the Chaldeans was fearful. Terrorists</code></p>
<pre><code>Their justice and authority originate with themselves.
</code></pre>
<p><code>They do not acquire their justice from God. They establish their own. A strange form of justice of of their own. </code></p>
<pre><code>8 Their horses are faster than leopards,
    And quicker than wolves in the evening.
    
Their horsemen charge along,
    Their horsemen come from afar;
        They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour.
        
    9 All of them come for violence.
        Their horde of faces moves forward.
             They gather captives like sand.
    10 They make fun of kings,
				And dignitaries 
							are *an object of* laughter to them.
				They laugh at every fortress,
							Then heap up dirt and capture it.
		11 Then they fly along *like* the wind and pass on.
</code></pre>
<p><code>Fast, stealthy, violent, oppressive, smart, undefeatable</code></p>
<pre><code>But they will be held guilty,
They whose strength is their god.”
</code></pre>
<p><code>Their strength is their god. They worship their strength. They are only as strong as their strength. Yet it is God will ultimately see justice done - they will be held guilty. </code></p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>		14 *Why* have You made people like the fish of the sea,
				Like crawling things that have no ruler over them?
		15 *The Chaldeans* bring all of them up with a hook,
					Drag them away with their net,
					And gather them together in their fishing net.
							Therefore they rejoice and are joyful.
							16 Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net
				And burn incense to their fishing net,
					Because through these things their catch is large,
							And their food is  plentiful.
								17 Will they therefore empty their net,
												And continually slay nations without sparing?
</code></pre><p><code>Their condemnation is just. Why are you teaming up with them?</code></p>

7 Will your creditors not rise up suddenly,

And the hiding of His might is there.
5 Before Him goes plague,
And plague comes forth after Him.
6 He stood and caused the earth to shudder;
He looked and caused the nations to jump.
Yes, the everlasting mountains were shattered,
The ancient hills collapsed.
His paths are everlasting.

The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.

The downpour of waters swept by.
The deep raised its voice,
It lifted high its hands.

my lips quivered.
Decay enters my bones,

<h2 id="hVI">Background of Habakkuk</h2>
<p><strong>Date of writing</strong>: about 609-605 B.C.</p>
<p>​	In 620 B.C.E., revolts throughout the Assyrian Empire gave the Chaldeans the 	distraction they needed to take over Babylon.</p>
<p>​	In 612 B.C. Ninevah is destroyed</p>
<p>​	The Chaldeans had finally become a regional power.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Circumstances:</strong> Jehoiakim is King (609-598).  He is 25 when placed in power.</p>
<p>Several prophets: Jeremiah is young, Zephaniah and Zechariah are young and so is Habakkuk.</p>
