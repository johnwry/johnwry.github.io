<h2 id="greeting">Greeting</h2>
<p>2Ti 1:1  Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:2  To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<h2 id="guard-the-deposit-entrusted-to-you">Guard the Deposit Entrusted to You</h2>
<p>2Ti 1:3  I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:4  longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:5  For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:6  For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:7  For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:8  Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:9  who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:10  but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:11  for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:12  For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:13  Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:14  Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:15  You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:16  The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;</p>
<p>2Ti 1:17  but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me—</p>
<p>2Ti 1:18  the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.</p>
<h2 id="a-good-soldier-of-christ-jesus">A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus</h2>
<p>2Ti 2:1  You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:2  The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:3  Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:4  No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:5  Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:6  The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:7  Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:8  Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:9  for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:10  For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:11  It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;</p>
<p>2Ti 2:12  If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;</p>
<p>2Ti 2:13  If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.</p>
<h2 id="a-worker-approved-by-god">A Worker Approved by God</h2>
<p>2Ti 2:14  Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:15  Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:16  But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:17  and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:18  men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:19  Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2Ti 2:20  Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:21  Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:22  Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:23  But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:24  The Lord&rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:25  with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:26  and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.</p>
<h2 id="godlessness-in-the-last-days">Godlessness in the Last Days</h2>
<p>2Ti 3:1  But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:2  For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:3  unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:4  treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:5  holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:6  For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:7  always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:8  Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:9  But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes&rsquo;s and Jambres&rsquo;s folly was also.</p>
<h2 id="all-scripture-is-breathed-out-by-god">All Scripture Is Breathed Out by God</h2>
<p>2Ti 3:10  Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:11  persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!</p>
<p>2Ti 3:12  Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:13  But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:14  You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:15  and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:16  All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;</p>
<p>2Ti 3:17  so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.</p>
<h2 id="preach-the-word">Preach the Word</h2>
<p>2Ti 4:1  I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:</p>
<p>2Ti 4:2  preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:3  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,</p>
<p>2Ti 4:4  and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:5  But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:6  For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:7  I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;</p>
<p>2Ti 4:8  in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.
Personal Instructions</p>
<p>2Ti 4:9  Make every effort to come to me soon;</p>
<p>2Ti 4:10  for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:11  Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:12  But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:13  When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:14  Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:15  Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:16  At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:17  But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:18  The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<h2 id="final-greetings">Final Greetings</h2>
<p>2Ti 4:19  Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:20  Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:21  Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:22  The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</p>

<p>You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me,</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus,</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>but when he was in Rome,</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>he eagerly searched for me and found me—</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>The things which you have heard from me</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>in the presence of many witnesses,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>entrust these to faithful men</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>who will be able to teach others also.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Suffer hardship with me,</p>
<p><code>suffer συγκακοπάθησον aorist active imperative </code></p>
<p>as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Also if anyone competes as an athlete,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Consider what I say,</p>
<p><code>consider νόει present active imperative</code></p>
<p>for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Remember Jesus Christ,</p>
<p><code>remember Μνημόνευε present active imperative </code></p>
<p>risen from the dead,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>descendant of David,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>according to my gospel,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>but the word of God is not imprisoned.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>For this reason I endure all things</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for the sake of those who are chosen,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>so that they also may obtain the salvation</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>It is a trustworthy statement:</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>For if we died with Him,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>we will also live with Him;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>If we endure,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>we will also reign with Him;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>If we deny Him, He also will deny us;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>If we are faithless, He remains faithful,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for He cannot deny Himself.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Remind them of these things,</p>
<p><code>remind ὑπομίμνῃσκε, present active imperative </code></p>
<p>and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Be diligent to present yourself</p>
<p><code>diligent σπούδασον aorist active imperative</code></p>
<p>approved</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>to God</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>as a workman who does not need to be</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>ashamed,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>accurately handling the word of truth.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>But avoid worldly and empty chatter,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for it will lead to further ungodliness,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and their talk will spread like gangrene.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>men who have gone astray from the truth</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>saying that the resurrection has already taken place,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and they upset the faith of some.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>having this seal,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,&rdquo;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and, &ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>abstain Ἀποστήτω aorist active imperative </code></p>
<p>Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>but also vessels of wood and of earthenware,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and some to honor and some to dishonor.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>useful to the Master,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>prepared for every good work.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Now flee from youthful lusts</p>
<p><code>flee φεῦγε, presenta active imperative</code></p>
<p>and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace,</p>
<p><code>pursue δίωκε present active imperative </code></p>
<p>with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>knowing that they produce quarrels.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>but be kind to all,</p>
<p>``</p>
<p>able to teach,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>patient when wronged,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>if perhaps God may grant them repentance</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come to</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>their senses and escape from the snare of the devil,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>having been held captive by him to do his will.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</p>
<p><code>realize γίνωσκε present active imperative</code></p>
<p>For men will be lovers of self,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>lovers of money,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>boastful,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>arrogant,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>revilers,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>disobedient to parents,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>ungrateful,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>unholy,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>unloving,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>irreconcilable,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>malicious gossips,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>without self-control,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>brutal,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>haters of good,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>treacherous,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>reckless,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>conceited,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>holding to a form of godliness,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>although they have denied its power;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Avoid such men as these.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>For among them are those</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>who enter into households and captivate weak women</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>weighed down with sins,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>led on by various impulses,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>so these men also oppose the truth,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>men of depraved mind,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>rejected in regard to the faith.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>But they will not make further progress;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for their folly will be obvious to all,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>just as Jannes&rsquo;s and Jambres&rsquo;s folly was also.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Now you followed my teaching,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>conduct,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>purpose,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>

<p><code> </code></p>
<p>perseverance,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>persecutions,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and sufferings, such as</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>happened to me at Antioch,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>at Iconium</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and at Lystra;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>what persecutions I endured,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and out of them all the</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Lord rescued me!</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Indeed, all who desire</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>to live godly in Christ Jesus</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>will be persecuted.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>But evil men</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and impostors</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>will proceed</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>from bad to worse,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>You, however,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>continue in the things you have learned</p>
<p><code>continue μένε present active imperative </code></p>
<p>and become convinced of,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>knowing from whom you have learned them,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and that from childhood</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>you have known the sacred writings</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>which are able to give you</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>the wisdom</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>that leads to salvation through faith</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>All Scripture is inspired by God</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and profitable for teaching,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for reproof,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>

<p>so that the man of God may be adequate,</p>

<p>equipped for every good work.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>I solemnly charge you</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>who is to judge the living and the dead,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and by His appearing and His kingdom:</p>

<p><code>exhort παρακάλεσον, aorist active imperative</code></p>
<p>with great patience</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and instruction.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>For the time will come</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>when they will not endure sound doctrine;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>but wanting to have their ears tickled,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>they will accumulate for themselves teachers</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>in accordance to their own desires,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and will turn away their ears from the truth</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and will turn aside to myths.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>

<p>I have fought the good fight,</p>

<p>I have finished the course,</p>

<p>I have kept the faith;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>in the future there is laid up for me</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>the crown of righteousness,</p>

<p>which the Lord,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>the righteous Judge,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>will award to me on that day;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and not only to me,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>but also to all who have loved His appearing.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Make every effort to come to me soon;</p>

<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>the Lord will repay him</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>according to his deeds.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>Be on guard against him yourself,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>for he vigorously opposed our teaching.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>At my first defense no one supported me,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished,</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and that all the Gentiles might hear;</p>
<p><code> </code></p>
<p>and I was rescued out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed,</p>

<p>2Ti 1:3  I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:4  longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:5  For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:6  For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:7  For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:8  Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:9  who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:10  but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>
<p>2Ti 1:11  for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:12  For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:13  Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:14  Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:15  You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p>2Ti 1:16  The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;</p>
<p>2Ti 1:17  but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me—</p>
<p>2Ti 1:18  the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:1  You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:2  The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:3  Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:4  No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:5  Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:6  The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:7  Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:8  Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:9  for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:10  For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:11  It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;</p>
<p>2Ti 2:12  If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;</p>
<p>2Ti 2:13  If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:14  Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:15  Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:16  But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:17  and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:18  men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:19  Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, &ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2Ti 2:20  Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:21  Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:22  Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:23  But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.</p>
<p>2Ti 2:24  The Lord&rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:25  with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,</p>
<p>2Ti 2:26  and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:1  But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:2  For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:3  unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:4  treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:5  holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:6  For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:7  always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:8  Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:9  But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes&rsquo;s and Jambres&rsquo;s folly was also.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:10  Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:11  persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!</p>
<p>2Ti 3:12  Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:13  But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:14  You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,</p>
<p>2Ti 3:15  and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 3:16  All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;</p>
<p>2Ti 3:17  so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:1  I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:</p>
<p>2Ti 4:2  preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:3  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,</p>
<p>2Ti 4:4  and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:5  But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:6  For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:7  I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;</p>
<p>2Ti 4:8  in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.
Personal Instructions</p>
<p>2Ti 4:9  Make every effort to come to me soon;</p>
<p>2Ti 4:10  for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:11  Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:12  But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:13  When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:14  Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:15  Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:16  At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:17  But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:18  The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:19  Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:20  Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:21  Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.</p>
<p>2Ti 4:22  The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.</p>
