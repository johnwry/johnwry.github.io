One&#39;s view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does. God is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God&#39;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah." /><title>Zechariah | BJWry</title>

<p>Zechariah
Return to Me!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!&hellip;For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel 23, God tells a story of two young sisters who He takes on as wives. The older sister, Oholah, desired what the Assyrians had to offer and she gave herself in harlotry to them.  The younger sister, Oholibah was even worse and gave herself in like manner to the Babylonians. Both women committed abominable acts of harlotry and bare children to these nations. The two women serve as an allegory of Israel (to the north) and Judah (to the south) giving themselves in idolatry and being exiled to the nations.</p>
<p>Following through with the story of the two women, we could continue saying Oholah and her children haven&rsquo;t been heard from. Oholibah and her children have recently returned to the land after being away 70 years. God has asked them to rebuild His house.</p>
<p>This story serves as a background for the setting of the book of Zechariah. As soon as the people returned from Babylon, the returnees set up an altar to carry out the daily sacrifices and laid the foundation of the temple but soon afterwards faced opposition and the construction was stopped for about 16 years.</p>
<p>The illustrations Zechariah brings out in this book are enlightening and convicting! He has a list of appropriate examples among the people to help realize their true spiritual condition. Returnees who never returned, mourners who forgot why, a high priest in dirty duds before God, fleecing shepherds and sheep blindly following a foolish shepherd, are only some of the illustrations given in this little known book.</p>
<p>The book of Zechariah contains a powerful message. One&rsquo;s view of God is profoundly impacted and challenged. It contains theologial correction, spiritual uplifting and eschotological orientation that present the historical interactions between a scruffy lot and a God who genuinely cares for them, constantly arranging and rearranging so they might return. It presents Messiah in a unique light as the eternal choice of God&rsquo;s servant to bring about the return of the people, restoration to the land, national blessings and blessing to the nations and ultimate glory to God because His knowledge will fill the earth.</p>
<p>You are about to embark on the magnificent account of the ages of a prodigal nation who wanders endlessly and of a loving Father who waits tirelessly until his son, yes his dear son, comes home at last. This book is bound to encourage you as it was intended for the generation of Zechariah, to a real, intimate fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Zechariah is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out and some of the details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.</p>
<p>Zechariah clearly lays out God&rsquo;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah.</p>
<p>God reveals His will, He calls people back to Himself and provides the way for their coming, and He promises that if they will return to Him, He will return to them.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The book of Zechariah is arguably the most Messianic, apocalyptic and eschatological of all the Old Testament. Yet at the heart of it lies one single message throughout, &ldquo;return to Me says the Lord&hellip;&rdquo;. It is more than a command to hold them to the covenant, God reveals his heart in present and future plans for the nation to woo them back into a loving relationship with Him. He will show them the error of their thinking and prove to them of his undying devotion for her. Return to Me, is a heart felt invitation into fellowship with their maker.</p>

<p>For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;</p>
<p>His craft and pow&rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate,</p>
<p>On earth is not his equal.</p>

<p>His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,</p>

</h1><p>A more recent Jewish “commentator,” Woody Allen, has cautioned: “And the lamb and the wolf shall lie down together, but the lamb won’t get any sleep.”</p>
<p>The Jewish belief that the Messiah’s reign lies in the future has long distinguished Jews from their Christian neighbors who believe, of course, that the Messiah came two thousand years ago in the person of Jesus. The most basic reason for the Jewish denial of the messianic claims made on Jesus’ behalf is that he did not usher in world peace, as Isaiah had prophesied: “And nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore” (<a
  href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/yeshayahu-isaiah-chapter-2"
    class="is-pretty-link">Isaiah 2:4</a
>
). In addition, Jesus did not help bring about Jewish political sovereignty for the Jews or protection from their enemies.</p>

<p>Charles Feinberg - Wickedness, furthermore, will not find it difficult to adjust itself there, for Babylon is her own place. It is to abide where it originated and where it has always belonged.

<p>John F. Walvoord The predictions of Isaiah have to do with Babylon’s ultimate destruction in the Day of the Lord. The near and the far view are often mingled as in chapter 13. The destruction of Babylon is pictured in Isaiah 13:1-11 as part of God’s program to punish the entire world (cp. 13:11). The historic conquering of Babylon by the Medes and the Persians is mentioned specifically in Isaiah 13:17-19 The prophet seems to refer to the far view, that is, the destruction of Babylon in relation to the second coming of Christ. Isaiah 13:20-22.&#160;<a href="#fnref:13" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>John F. Walvoord the prophecies of Jeremiah are notable because they were delivered at the peak of Babylon’s power when it seemed most unlikely that the great nation would fall. Babylon is pictured as being punished because of its cruel treatment of Israel (50:17, 18; 51:24, 49).Practically all of the predictions of Jeremiah seem to relate to the fall of Babylon by the attack of the Medes and the Persians. Only occasionally does there seem to be a reference to a future ultimate destruction as in Jeremiah 51:62-64. The prophecies of Jeremiah predicting the fall of Babylon at the hands of the Medes and the Persians were graphically fulfilled approximately sixty-five years later, as recorded in Daniel 5&#160;<a href="#fnref:14" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The Times of Israel - Israel lies along an active fault line: the Syrian-African rift, a tear in the earth’s crust that runs the length of the border separating Israel and Jordan. The last major earthquake to hit the region was in 1927 — a 6.2-magnitude tremor that killed 500 people and injured 700 — and seismologists estimate that such earthquakes occur in this region approximately every 100 years. According to Kan, a major earthquake is predicted to cause about 7,000 deaths and 145,000 injuries, with 170,000 people left homeless and 320,000 buildings damaged.&#160;<a href="#fnref:36" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
