One&#39;s view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does. God is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God&#39;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah." /><title>Zechariah | BJWry</title>

<blockquote>
<p>Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!&hellip;For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will <em>their</em> acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel 23 God tells a story of two young sisters who He takes on as wives. The older sister, Oholah, desired what the Assyrians had to offer and she gave herself in harlotry to them.  The younger sister, Oholibah was even worse and gave herself in like manner to the Babylonians. Both women committed abominable acts of harlotry. The two women are an allegory of Israel and Judah giving themselves in idolatry to the nations.</p>
<p>The book of Zechariah contains a powerful message to the reader. One&rsquo;s view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does. It contains theologial teaching, spiritual uplifting and eschotological information that presents the Messiah in a unique way as the eternal</p>
<p>Zechariah  is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out through and some details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.</p>
<p>God is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God&rsquo;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances it would appear as though God had forgotten Israel. Zechariah (<em>Yahweh remembers</em>) son of Berechiah (<em>Yahweh blesses</em>) and grandson of Iddo (<em>appointed time</em>). This offer is always before Israel yet they reject Him over and over. Eventually Israel will be brought through a great Tribulation and only then will the the prophecies of Zechariah be fully accomplished. It will be when God remembers Israel at His appointed time and where the blessings will never fade away again.</p>

</h3><p>A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;</p>
<p>Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:</p>
<p>For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;</p>
<p>His craft and pow&rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate,</p>
<p>On earth is not his equal.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;</p>
<p>Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing.</p>
<p>Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;</p>
<p><strong>Lord Sabaoth is his name</strong>, from age to age the same,</p>
<p>And He must win the battle.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,</p>
<p>We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us;</p>
<p>The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;</p>
<p>His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,</p>
<p>One little word shall fell him.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>That word above all earthly pow&rsquo;rs, no thanks to them, abideth;</p>
<p>The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth;</p>
<p>Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;</p>
<p>The body they may kill: God&rsquo;s truth abideth still,</p>

<p>Antiquities 11.8.4-5 Now Alexander, when he had taken Gaza, made haste to go up to Jerusalem; and Jaddua the high-priest, when he heard that, was in agony, and under terror, as not knowing how he should meet the Macedonians, since the king was displeased at his foregoing disobedience. He therefore ordained that the people should make supplications, and should join with him in offering sacrifices to God, whom he besought to protect that nation, and to deliver them from the perils that were coming upon them; whereupon God warned him in a dream, which came upon him after he had offered sacrifice, that he should take courage, adorn the city, and open the gates; that the rest appear in white garments, but that he and the priests should meet the king in habits proper to their order, without the dread of any ill consequences, which the providence of God would prevent. Upon which, when he rose from his sleep, he greatly rejoiced; and declared to all the warning he had received from God. According to the dream he acted entirely, and so waited for the coming of the king.And when he understood that he was not far from the city, he went out in procession, with the priests and the multitude of the citizens. The procession was venerable, and the manner of it different from that of other nations. It reached to a place called Sapha; which name, translated in Greek, signifies a <em>prospect</em>, for you have thence a prospect both of Jerusalem and of the temple; and when the Phoenicians and the Chaldeans that followed him, thought they should have liberty to plunder the city, and torment the high-priest to death, which the king’s displeasure fairly promised them, the very reverse of it happened; for Alexander, when he saw the multitude at a distance, in white garments, while the priests stood clothed with fine linen, and the high-priest in purple and scarlet clothing, with his mitre on his head having the golden plate on which the name of God was engraved, he approached by himself, and adored that name, and first saluted the high-priest. The Jews also did all together, with one voice, salute Alexander, and encompass him about: whereupon the kings of Syria and the rest were surprised at what Alexander had done, and supposed him to be disordered in his mind. However, Parmenio [Alexander’s second-in-command] alone went up to him, and asked him how it came to pass, that when all others adored him, he should adore the high-priest of the Jews? To whom he replied, “I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit, when I was at Dios, in Macedonia, who, when I was considering with myself how I might obtain the dominion of Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but boldly to pass over the sea thither, for that he would conduct my army, and would give me dominion over the Persians; whence it is, that having seen no other in that habit, and now seeing this person in it, and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind.” And when he had said this to Parmenio, and had given the high-priest his right hand, the priests ran along by him, and he came into the city; and when he went up into the temple, he offered sacrifice to God, according to the high-priest’s direction, and magnificently treated both the high-priest and the priests. And when the book of Daniel was showed him, wherein Daniel declared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire of the Persians, he supposed that himself was the person intended; and as he was then glad, he dismissed the multitude for the present, but the next day he called them to him, and bade them ask what favors they pleased of him: whereupon the high-priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of their forefathers, and might pay no tribute on the seventh year. He granted all they desired: and when they entreated him that he would permit the Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also, he willingly promised to do hereafter what they desired: and when he said to the multitude, that if any of them would enlist themselves in his army on this condition, that they should continue under the laws of their forefathers, and live according to them, he was willing to take them with him, many were ready to accompany him in his wars.&rdquo;&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref1:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a>&#160;<a href="#fnref2:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

It may help to realize the phrase &ldquo;repent of your sins&rdquo; is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says &ldquo;<em>repent <strong>for</strong> the forgiveness of sins</em>&rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.</a></li>

The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not are not a requirement by God for the internal to be authentic.  Luke 3:8-18,</a></li>
