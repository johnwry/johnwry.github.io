</h3><blockquote>
<p>God invited this generation to return to himself. It was an invitation to a relationship of trust and dependance in God. The previous generation had disobeyed God. They returned physically to the land, they even recognized their error but never changed their minds and placed their faith in God alone. Returning to God is an act of faith (changing one&rsquo;s mind towards God) not by external works (ie returning to the land, rebuilding the temple).</p>

<h1 id='zechariah-17-615---message-2---eight-visions'>Zechariah 1:7-6:15 - Message #2 - Eight Visions<a href='#zechariah-17-615---message-2---eight-visions' class='anchor'>#</a>
</h1><p>The eight visions Zechariah were given to serve as an encouragement to the nation.  Essentially a greater understanding of Messiah and His kingdom is given. Throughout history God has been progressively revealing His redemptive plan through His Son.</p>
<p>Mat 1:17 <em>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.</em> Matthew appears to be dividing Jewish history into forms of ruling. It went from aristocracy, to monarchy,  to oligarchy, to Messiah. Jesus Christ the son of Abraham, the son of David, is presented as the Messiah (called the Christ). Matt 1:1, John 4:25, Luk 2:11</p>
<p>​	The Messiah was recognized by:</p>
<p>​	The blind - Joh 9:38</p>
<p>​	The demons - Luk 4:41</p>
<p>​	The elderly - Luk 2:25-38</p>
<p>​	Fishermen. - Luk 9:20,</p>
<p>​	Criminals - Luke 23:39-42</p>
<p>​	The Scriptures - Luke 24:46, Act 2:31,</p>
<p>​	Women - Joh 11:27</p>
<p>​	Early believers - Act 5:42</p>
<p>​	Samarians - Acts 8:12</p>
<p>​	Pious Jews - Act 18:5</p>
<p>​	The Law - Gal 3:24</p>
<p>Zechariah received these 8 visions in one night.</p>
