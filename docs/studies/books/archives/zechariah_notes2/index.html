<p>Title: Zekar-yah = God remembers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On December 18, 520 BC, <strong>Zechariah</strong> began his ministry. Zechariah 1:1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zechariah is a post-exilic book</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-exilic - Habakkuk, Zephaniah</li>
<li>Exilic- Daniel, Ezekiel</li>
<li>Post-exilic - Zechariah, Haggai,</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zechariah 1:1 – Zechariah, which means <em>Yahweh remembers</em>, prophesied at the same time as Haggai to encourage <strong>Israel</strong> to finish rebuilding the Temple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of the book can be remembered by the formula 8-4-2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Zechariah 1-6 – Eight <strong>Visions</strong></li>
<li>Zechariah 7-8 – Four <strong>Messages</strong></li>
<li>Zechariah 9-14 – Two <strong>Burdens</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The New Testament <strong>quotes</strong> or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Zechariah</strong> (520-490 BC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Author: Zechariah. Was a levite who was born in Babylon (Neh 12:1, 16). He was the son of Berekiah and the grandson of Iddo the priest (Zechariah 1:1; cf. 12:4, 16; Ezra 5:1; 6:14](javascript:{})), therefore, although the name was a common one, it is possible that he was a priest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zechariah was a prophet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zechariah was probably young (Zechariah 2:4). He is also stated as the head of the family (Neh 6:14) at 520BC which at the time of the writing makes him a young man. Possibly his grandfather and father had since passed away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audience: Returned Remnant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purpose: To encourage the returned remnant to rebuild the temple by focusing on the future hope of Messiah</p>
</li>

</h3><p>• It reveals behind the scenes Spiritual warfare</p>
<p>• It reveals Israel&rsquo;s future kingdom and the nations under it.</p>
<p>• Because God remembers his promises (Meaning of Zechariah).</p>
<p>• It is because of the prophecy of this book and teh book of Haggai that the temple was rebuilt. Ezra 4:5</p>
<p>After 70 years God raised up a man named Cyrus to open the door to Juda&rsquo;s return to the land (Ezra 1:2-4). This return happened in three waves. The first wave was led by a man named Zerubabel. This first return is the time at which the prophecy of Zechariah is given.
Upon Juda&rsquo;s return to Jerusalem they first rebuilt the altar of the Lord and reestablished sacrifices (Ezra 3:1-6). Also, the Temple was to be rebuilt with donations of material and money (Ezra 3:1–7) but up to the point where Zechariah&rsquo;s prophecy begins, only the foundation has been laid (Ezra 3:8-13, 5:16). Opposition from the Samaritans has delayed the work about 18 years.</p>

On earth is not his equal.</p>

And He must win the battle.</p>

One little word shall fell him.</p>

It's appears as though things are going well apart from the opposition from the Samaritans. Perhaps Zechariah's message should be rather, rebuild the temple no matter the obstacles, just get it done! Yet, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, they must first of all return to Him by faith. This, perhaps was totally overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances. SO, when a little trial comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, simple trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded.

In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original metanoia (change your mind). We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. </code><a href='#a-note-about-repentance-the-word-repentance-in-the-bible-is-used-in-different-ways-and-it-has-caused-a-lot-of-confusion-especially-regarding-the-correct-response-to-the-gospel-in-1384-john-wycliffe-produced-the-first-hand-written-english-bible-wycliffe-used-jersomes-latin-bible-as-his-sole-source-which-unfortunately-had-several-grave-mistranslations-one-such-mistranslation-was-the-greek-word-metanoia-to-change-ones-thinking-or-perspective-to-a-word-which-means-to-do-acts-of-penance-to-be-penitent-the-first-english-bible-had-a-tremendous-influence-on-the-english-language-and-the-term-repentance-feel-sorry-be-penitent-replaced-the-original-metanoia-change-your-mind-we-can-understand-then-why-the-hebrew-word-shub-to-turn-back-return-here-is-translated-to-repent-when-it-was-much-clearer-to-translate-it-return-physically-they-returned-yet-spiritually-they-did-not-' class='anchor'>#</a>

</h5><p><code>The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him. </code></p>
<p><code>Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, &quot;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned *by rote,* Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.&quot; Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are *done* in a dark place, And they say, &quot;Who sees us?&quot; or &quot;Who knows us?&quot; You turn *things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, &quot;He did not make me&quot;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, &quot;He has no understanding&quot;?</code></p>
<p><code>God wanted this generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith.</code></p>

<p>Zechariah 1:8a  <em>I saw at night&hellip;</em> This is not a <strong><u>dream</u></strong>, it is a <strong>vision</strong>, he received while awake at night. Visions were received while awake and dreams are revelations while asleep. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Num 12:6</p>

<p><code>Nehemiah 8:15 implies that myrtle trees possibly grew in or near Jerusalem. They are certainly all through modern Palestine. Most pictures of myrtle trees show it as a shrub about 8-10 feet tall but given the right conditions and with plenty of water, it grows to a considerable size. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther's Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 </code></p>

Nehemiah mentions myrtle branches during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths. Isaiah states that during the milenial reign when everything is restored, God will turn briars (result of man's sin) into myrtle trees. Isaiah 41:19, Isaiah 55:13,</code></p>
<p>with red,
sorrel
and white
horses behind him. <code>Red, sorrel and white horses behind him</code>
Then I said,
&ldquo;My lord, what are these?&rdquo; <code>Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw. </code>
And the angel
who was speaking with me
said to me,
&ldquo;I will show you what these are.&rdquo; <code>It is not the receptor's task to interpret some mysterious dream. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Rev 1:1</code>
And the man
who was standing
among the myrtle trees
answered and said, <code>the man on the red horse himself explains...</code>
&ldquo;These are those
whom the LORD has sent
to patrol the earth.&rdquo; <code>This is most likely something that is constantly going on. We know from Job 1:6-7 that Satan also roams to and fro over the earth. This angel patrol also roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7 </code></p>
<p>So they answered the angel of the LORD <code>The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 6 times in Zechariah. This “*man among the myrtle trees*” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), Many scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth. The angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), Abraham (18; 22:11–18), Jacob (31:11, 13), Moses (Ex. 3), Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23) and Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).</code></p>
<p>who was standing
among the myrtle trees
and said,
&ldquo;We have patrolled the earth,</p>
<p>and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.&rdquo; <code>To the reader the initial thought might be, &quot;Peace! All is well!&quot;. The response by the angel of the Lord reflects things are far from right in order to be at peace. There's nothing wrong with peace as long as it is attained the right way. The nations were at peace at the expense of God's nation Israel. God has no regard for man's way of peace apart from Him. True, ultimate world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from his throne in Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4 Peace does not come until Babylon is destroyed. Rev 17-18, Zech 5</code></p>
<p>Then the angel of the LORD said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;O LORD of hosts,
how long will You have no compassion
for Jerusalem
and the cities of Judah,</p>
<p><code>The angel of the Lord requests the Lord of hosts for compassion. For centuries, “*How long?*” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Psa 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “*How long?*” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven. Rev. 6:10 Yet God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9 </code></p>
<p>​											with which You have been indignant
​											these seventy years?&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, &quot;how much longer are your people to suffer?&quot; Jer 29:10. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 17 extra years had passed and still &quot;*the earth is peaceful and quiet*&quot; and no temple has been erected.  Jer 29:10. The angel of the Lord's words reflect his concern for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are &quot;*at peace*&quot;.  It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Act 1:7. It was told to Daniel that ultimately it would be 70 units of 7. This comes to a total of 490 years that yet have to be fulfilled in their purpose. Dan 9:24-27</code></p>
<p>​				The LORD answered the angel
​							who was speaking with me
​				with gracious words,
​				comforting words. <code>The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the &quot;accusation&quot; and responds with kind words. Col 4:6</code></p>

</h3><p>​						&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
​								&ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous</p>
<p><code>The Lord kindly responds &quot;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!&quot; God has a strong devotion towards Israel.  Isa 54:8, Heb 12:6-7 This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel. </code></p>
<p>​											for Jerusalem and Zion. <code>Many times in Scripture we see how Zion is synonimous with Jerusalem. Yet here they shown distinct. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psa 2:6. Zion is the mountain on which God's house, the temple, stands. Mic 3:12. Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Mic 4:1, 3. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Mic 4:2</code></p>

​										for while I was only a little angry,
​										they furthered the disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>peace is a good thing but not at the cost of injustice. Israel is not in her land, she has been disbursed. Here the angel of the Lord is calling out for justice.</code></p>
<p><code>The Lord had said this would happen and had even promised to punish them (specifically in this case the Chaldeans) for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1 </code></p>
<p>​											&lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD,
​												&ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem

​															declares the LORD of hosts,
​															&ldquo;and a measuring line
​															will be stretched
​															over Jerusalem.&rdquo;&rsquo; <code>rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins.</code></p>
<p><code>We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort. About 200 years earlier, God had announced through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this....*&quot;It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'&quot;* Isa 44:28.

<code>Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when &quot;the Branch&quot; rules</code></p>
<p>Then he showed me Joshua
the high priest
standing before the angel of the LORD,
and Satan
standing at his right hand
to accuse him.
The LORD said to Satan,
&ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan!  <code>This must be Jesus rebuking Satan</code>
Indeed, the LORD
who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! <code>Satan's accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem.</code>
Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?&rdquo;
Now Joshua
was clothed		
with filthy garments
and standing before the angel.
He spoke and said to those
who were standing before him,
saying,
&ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.&rdquo; <code>Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments?</code>
Again he said to him,
&ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away
from you
and will clothe you
with festal robes.&rdquo; <code>This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's.</code>
Then I said,
&ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.&rdquo; <code>Perhaps the obvious next step, &quot;don't forget the turban!!&quot;. Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on...</code>
So they put a clean turban
on his head
and clothed him with garments,
while the angel of the LORD was standing by.
And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua,
saying,
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;If you will walk in My ways
and if you will perform My service,
then you will also
govern My house  ``God gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Eze 44:15-16 Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27<code>and also have charge of My courts, </code>The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests would be placed in charge of all the courts.<code> and I will grant you  free access among these  who are standing *here.*</code>The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. `</p>
<p><code>Notice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here...&quot;IF you will walk...then you will govern my house&quot;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.</code></p>
<p><code>In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 2:5</code></p>
<p>​							&lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, <code>Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.</code>
​										you and your friends
​												who are sitting in front of you—
​										indeed they are men who are a symbol,  <code>you and your friends - friends symbolize all the priests</code>
​										for behold, I am going to bring in My servant

​							&lsquo;For behold, the stone

​								on one stone are seven eyes.  <code>THis addition is very interesting...&quot;before Joshua&quot; the stone. The cornerstone.  The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6</code>

</h3><p>Then the angel
who was speaking with me
returned and roused me,
as a man who is awakened from his sleep.  <code>Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to so he was wide awake when receiving the vision.</code>
He said to me,
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;
And I said,
&ldquo;I see, and behold,
a lampstand all of gold
with its bowl on the top of it,  <code>a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks</code>
and its seven lamps on it
with seven spouts
belonging to each of the lamps
which are on the top of it;  <code>Ex 25:37</code>
also two olive trees by it,
one on the right side of the bowl
and the other on its left side.&rdquo;
Then I said to the angel
who was speaking with me saying,
&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;
So the angel
who was speaking with me
answered and said to me,
&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;
And I said,
&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;
Then he said to me,  <code>particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained</code>
&ldquo;This is the word of the LORD
to Zerubbabel saying, <code>a specific message to Zerubbabel... </code>who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12). His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge.`</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts.  <code>certainly contrary to those who say, &quot;ease does not produce strength&quot;. Grace is what teaches us about God's provision against sin, God inner strengthening of His Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit teaches us in all truth (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are commanded to get our strenghtening by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2)</code>
&lsquo;What are you, O great mountain?
Before Zerubbabel <em>you will become</em> a plain;  <code>nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! </code>
and he will bring forth the top stone
with shouts of &ldquo;Grace, grace to it!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;  <code>The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubbabel Zerubbabel or look what we accomplished. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!</code><br>
Also the word of the LORD came to me,
saying,
&ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel
have laid the foundation of this house,<br>
and his hands will finish <em>it.</em>  <code>Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God.This prophecy was fulfilled when the temple was completed five years later in 515b.C. </code></p>
<p>​	Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
​	&ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things?
​	But these seven will be glad
​	when they see the plumb line
​	in the hand of Zerubbabel—<code>a plumb line is used for building. When God sees them back at rebuilding the temple, it will be a joyous thing to God. </code>
​	<em>these are</em> the eyes of the LORD <code>the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6</code>
​	which range to and fro
​	throughout the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I said to him,
&ldquo;What are these two olive trees
on the right of the lampstand
and on its left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I answered the second time and said to him,
&ldquo;What are the two olive branches
which are beside the two golden pipes,
which empty the golden <em>oil</em> from themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he answered me, saying,
&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;
And I said,
&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;
Then he said,
&ldquo;These are the two anointed ones
who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.&rdquo;  <code>Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4</code></p>

And I answered,
&ldquo;I see a flying scroll;
its length is twenty cubits
and its width ten cubits.&rdquo; <code>the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5?</code>
Then he said to me,
&ldquo;This is the curse
that is going forth over the face
of the whole land;
surely everyone who steals will be purged away
according to the writing on one side,
and everyone who swears

and they lifted up the ephah
between the earth and the heavens.
I said to the angel who was speaking with me,
&ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?&rdquo;
Then he said to me,

<h3 id='four-chariots'>Four Chariots<a href='#four-chariots' class='anchor'>#</a>

four chariots were coming forth
from between the two mountains;
and the mountains <em>were</em> bronze mountains.
With the first chariot <em>were</em> red horses,
with the second chariot black horses,
with the third chariot white horses,
and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.
Then I spoke and said to the angel
who was speaking with me,
&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;
The angel replied to me,
&ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven,
going forth
after standing before the Lord of all the earth,
with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country;
and the white ones go forth after them,
while the dappled ones go forth to the south country.
&ldquo;When the strong ones went out,
they were eager to go to patrol the earth.&rdquo;
And He said,
&ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.&rdquo;
So they patrolled the earth.
Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,
&ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.&rdquo;
The word of the LORD also came to me,
saying,
&ldquo;Take <em>an offering</em>
from the exiles,
from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah;
and you go the same day
and enter the house of Josiah
the son of Zephaniah,
where they have arrived from Babylon.
&ldquo;Take silver and gold,
make an <em>ornate</em> crown
and set <em>it</em>on the head of Joshua
the son of Jehozadak,
the high priest.
&ldquo;Then say to him,
&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;Behold, a man
whose name is Branch,
for He will branch out from where He is;
and He will build the temple of the LORD.
&ldquo;Yes, it is He
who will build the temple of the LORD,
and He who will bear the honor
and sit and rule
on His throne.
Thus, He will be
a priest
on His throne,
and the counsel of peace
will be between the two offices.&rdquo;&rsquo;
&ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder
in the temple of the LORD
to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen
the son of Zephaniah.
&ldquo;Those who are far off
will come and build the temple of the LORD.&rdquo;
Then you will know
that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
And it will take place
if you completely obey the LORD your God.</p>

&lsquo;When you eat and drink,
do you not eat for yourselves
and do you not drink for yourselves?
&lsquo;Are not <em>these</em> the words
which the LORD proclaimed
by the former prophets,
when Jerusalem was inhabited
and prosperous
along with its cities around it,
and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah
saying,<br>
&ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said,
&lsquo;Dispense true justice
and practice kindness
and compassion each to his brother;
and do not oppress
the widow
or the orphan,
the stranger
or the poor;
and do not devise evil in your hearts
against one another.&rsquo;
&ldquo;But they refused to pay attention
and turned a stubborn shoulder
and stopped their ears from hearing.
&ldquo;They made their hearts <em>like</em> flint
so that they could not hear the law
and the words
which the LORD of hosts had sent
by His Spirit
through the former prophets;
therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen,
so they called and I would not listen,&rdquo;
says the LORD of hosts;
&ldquo;but I scattered them
with a storm wind
among all the nations
whom they have not known.
Thus the land is desolated behind them
so that no one went back and forth,
for they made the pleasant land desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion,
yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD,
&lsquo;I will return to Zion
and will dwell
in the midst of Jerusalem.
Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,
and the mountain of the LORD of hosts
*will be called *the Holy Mountain.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit
in the streets of Jerusalem,
each man with his staff in his hand
because of age.<br>
&lsquo;And the streets of the city
will be filled with boys and girls
playing in its streets.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;If it is too difficult
in the sight of the remnant of this people
in those days,
will it also be too difficult in My sight?&rsquo;
declares the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people
from the land of the east
and from the land of the west;
and I will bring them <em>back</em>
and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem;
and they shall be My people,
and I will be their God
in truth and righteousness.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Let your hands be strong,
you who are listening
in these days
to these words
from the mouth of the prophets,
<em>those</em> who <em>spoke</em>
in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid,
to the end that the temple might be built.
&lsquo;For before those days there was no wage
for man or any wage for animal;
and for him
who went out
or came in
there was no peace
because of his enemies,
and I set all men one against another.
&lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant
of this people
as in the former days,
&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.
&lsquo;For <em>there will be</em> peace
for the seed:
the vine will yield its fruit,
the land will yield its produce
and the heavens will give their dew;
and I will cause the remnant
of this people to inherit all these <em>things.</em>
&lsquo;It will come about
that just as you were a curse
among the nations,
O house of Judah and house of Israel,
so I will save you
that you may become a blessing.
Do not fear; let your hands be strong.&rsquo;
&ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you
when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,&rsquo;
says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;and I have not relented,
so I have again purposed
in these days
to do good to Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah.
Do not fear!
&lsquo;These are the things which you should do:
speak the truth to one another;
judge with truth and judgment
for peace in your gates.
&lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart
against another,
and do not love perjury;
for all these are what I hate,&rsquo;
declares the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;The fast of the fourth,
the fast of the fifth,
the fast of the seventh
and the fast of the tenth <em>months</em>
will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts
for the house of Judah;
so love truth and peace.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;<em>It will</em> yet <em>be</em> that peoples will come,
even the inhabitants of many cities.
&lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another,
saying,
&ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD,
and to seek the LORD of hosts;
I will also go.&rdquo;
&lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come
to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem
and to entreat the favor of the LORD.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;In those days
ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew,
saying,
&ldquo;Let us go with you,
for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</h2><h3 id='burden-1---the-first-coming'>Burden #1 - The First Coming<a href='#burden-1---the-first-coming' class='anchor'>#</a>
</h3><p>The burden
of the word of the LORD
is against
the land of Hadrach,
with Damascus
as its resting place
(for the eyes of men,
especially of all the tribes of Israel,
are toward the LORD),
And Hamath also,
which borders on it;
Tyre and Sidon,
though they are very wise.
For Tyre built herself a fortress
And piled up silver like dust,
And gold like the mire of the streets.
Behold, the Lord will dispossess her
And cast her wealth into the sea;
And she will be consumed with fire.
Ashkelon will see <em>it</em> and be afraid.
Gaza too will writhe in great pain;
Also Ekron,
for her expectation has been confounded.
Moreover,
the king will perish from Gaza,
And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod,
And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
And I will remove their blood from their mouth
And their detestable things from between their teeth.
Then they also will be a remnant for our God,
And be like a clan in Judah,
And Ekron like a Jebusite.
But I will camp around My house
because of an army,
Because of him who passes by and returns;
And no oppressor will pass over them anymore,
For now I have seen with My eyes.
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
Shout <em>in triumph,</em>
O daughter of Jerusalem!
Behold, your king is coming to you;
He is just
and endowed with salvation,
Humble,
and mounted on a donkey,
Even on a colt,
the foal of a donkey.
I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
And the horse from Jerusalem;
And the bow of war will be cut off.
And He will speak peace to the nations;
And His dominion will be from sea to sea,
And from the River to the ends of the earth.
As for you also,
because of the blood of <em>My</em> covenant with you,
I have set your prisoners free
from the waterless pit.
Return to the stronghold,
O prisoners who have the hope;
This very day
I am declaring
that I will restore double to you.
For I will bend Judah as My bow,
I will fill the bow with Ephraim.
And I will stir up your sons, O Zion,
against your sons,
O Greece;
And I will make you like a warrior&rsquo;s sword.
Then the LORD will appear over them,
And His arrow will go forth like lightning;
And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet,
And will march in the storm winds of the south.
The LORD of hosts will defend them.
And they will devour and trample on the sling stones;
And they will drink <em>and</em>be boisterous as with wine;
And they will be filled like a <em>sacrificial</em> basin,
<em>Drenched</em> like the corners of the altar.
And the LORD their God will save them
in that day
As the flock of His people;
For <em>they are as</em> the stones of a crown,
Sparkling in His land.
For what comeliness and beauty <em>will be</em> theirs!
Grain will make the young men flourish,
and new wine the virgins.
Ask rain from the LORD
at the time of the spring rain—
The LORD who makes the storm clouds;
And He will give them showers of rain,
vegetation in the field to <em>each</em> man.
For the teraphim speak iniquity,
And the diviners
see lying visions
And tell false dreams;
They comfort in vain.
Therefore <em>the people</em> wander like sheep,
They are afflicted,
because there is no shepherd.
&ldquo;My anger is kindled
against the shepherds,
And I will punish the male goats;
For the LORD of hosts
has visited His flock,
the house of Judah,
And will make them
like His majestic horse in battle.
&ldquo;From them
will come the cornerstone,
From them
the tent peg,
From them
the bow of battle,
From them
every ruler,
<em>all</em> of them
together.
&ldquo;They will be as mighty men,
Treading down <em>the enemy</em>
in the mire of the streets in battle;
And they will fight,
for the LORD <em>will be</em> with them;
And the riders on horses will be put to shame.
&ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah,
And I will save the house of Joseph,
And I will bring them back,
Because I have had compassion on them;
And they will be as though I had not rejected them,
For I am the LORD their God
and I will answer them.
&ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man,
And their heart will be glad
as if <em>from</em> wine;
Indeed, their children will see <em>it</em> and be glad,
Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.
&ldquo;I will whistle for them
to gather them together,
For I have redeemed them;
And they will be as numerous as they were before.
&ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples,
They will remember Me in far countries,
And they
with their children
will live and come back.
&ldquo;I will bring them back
from the land of Egypt
And gather them from Assyria;
And I will bring them
into the land of Gilead
and Lebanon
Until no <em>room</em> can be found for them.
&ldquo;And they will pass
through the sea <em>of</em> distress
And He will strike the waves in the sea,
So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up;
And the pride of Assyria will be brought down
And the scepter of Egypt will depart.
&ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD,
And in His name they will walk,&rdquo;
declares the LORD.
Open your doors, O Lebanon,
That a fire may feed on your cedars.
Wail, O cypress,
for the cedar has fallen,
Because the glorious <em>trees</em> have been destroyed;
Wail, O oaks of Bashan,
For the impenetrable forest has come down.
There is a sound of the shepherds&rsquo; wail,
For their glory is ruined;
There is a sound of the young lions&rsquo; roar,
For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
Thus says the LORD my God,
&ldquo;Pasture the flock
<em>doomed</em> to slaughter.
&ldquo;Those who buy them
slay them and go unpunished,
and <em>each of</em> those
who sell them says,
&lsquo;Blessed be the LORD,
for I have become rich!&rsquo;
And their own shepherds have no pity on them.
&ldquo;For I will no longer have pity
on the inhabitants of the land,&rdquo;
declares the LORD;
&ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall,
each into another&rsquo;s power
and into the power of his king;
and they will strike the land,
and I will not deliver <em>them</em> from their power.&rdquo;
So I pastured the flock
<em>doomed</em> to slaughter,
hence the afflicted of the flock.
And I took for myself two staffs:
the one I called Favor
and the other I called Union;
so I pastured the flock.
Then I annihilated the three shepherds
in one month,
for my soul was impatient with them,
and their soul also was weary of me.
Then I said, &ldquo;I will not pasture you.
What is to die, let it die,
and what is to be annihilated,
let it be annihilated;
and let those who are left
eat one another&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo;
I took my staff Favor
and cut it in pieces,
to break my covenant
which I had made with all the peoples.
So it was broken on that day,
and thus the afflicted of the flock
who were watching me
realized that it was the word of the LORD.
I said to them,
&ldquo;If it is good in your sight,
give <em>me</em> my wages;
but if not, never mind!&rdquo;
So they weighed out thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver as my wages.
Then the LORD said to me,
&ldquo;Throw it to the potter,
<em>that</em> magnificent price
at which I was valued by them.&rdquo;
So I took the thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver
and threw them to the potter
in the house of the LORD.
Then I cut in pieces
my second staff Union,
to break the brotherhood
between Judah and Israel.
The LORD said to me,
&ldquo;Take again for yourself
the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
&ldquo;For behold,
I am going to raise up a shepherd
in the land
who will not care for the perishing,
seek the scattered,
heal the broken,
or sustain the one standing,
but will devour the flesh of the fat <em>sheep</em> and tear off their hoofs.
&ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd
Who leaves the flock!
A sword will be on his arm
And on his right eye!
His arm will be totally withered
And his right eye will be blind.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id='burden-2---the-second-coming'>Burden #2 - The Second Coming<a href='#burden-2---the-second-coming' class='anchor'>#</a>
</h3><p>The burden of the word of the LORD
concerning Israel.
<em>Thus</em> declares the LORD
who stretches out the heavens,
lays the foundation of the earth,
and forms the spirit of man within him,
&ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem
a cup that causes reeling
to all the peoples around;
and when the siege is against Jerusalem,
it will also be against Judah.
&ldquo;It will come about
in that day
that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone
for all the peoples;
all who lift it will be severely injured.
And all the nations of the earth
will be gathered against it.
&ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; declares the LORD,
&ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment
and his rider with madness.
But I will watch over the house of Judah,
while I strike every horse of the peoples
with blindness.
&ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts,
&lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem
through the LORD of hosts, their God.&rsquo;
&ldquo;In that day
I will make the clans of Judah
like a firepot
among pieces of wood
and a flaming torch among sheaves,
so they will consume on the right hand
and on the left all the surrounding peoples,
while the inhabitants of Jerusalem
again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.
&ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,
so that the glory of the house of David
and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem
will not be magnified above Judah.
&ldquo;In that day
the LORD will defend
the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and the one who is feeble among them
in that day will be like David,
and the house of David <em>will be</em> like God,
like the angel of the LORD before them.
&ldquo;And in that day
I will set about
to destroy all the nations
that come against Jerusalem.
&ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David
and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the Spirit of grace
and of supplication,
so that they will look on Me
whom they have pierced;
and they will mourn for Him,
as one mourns for an only son,
and they will weep bitterly over Him
like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.
&ldquo;In that day
there will be great mourning
in Jerusalem,
like the mourning of Hadadrimmon
in the plain of Megiddo.
&ldquo;The land will mourn,
every family by itself;
the family of the house of David
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the house of Nathan
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the house of Levi
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the Shimeites
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
all the families
that remain,
every family
by itself
and their wives
by themselves.
&ldquo;In that day
a fountain will be opened
for the house of David and
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
for sin and for impurity.
&ldquo;It will come about in that day,&rdquo;
declares the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land,
and they will no longer be remembered;
and I will also remove the prophets
and the unclean spirit from the land.
&ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies,
then his father and mother
who gave birth to him
will say to him,
&lsquo;You shall not live,
for you have spoken
falsely in the name 																												of the LORD&rsquo;;
and his father and mother
who gave birth to him
will pierce him through
when he prophesies.
&ldquo;Also it will come about
in that day
that the prophets will each be ashamed
of his vision when he prophesies,
and they will not put on a hairy robe
in order to deceive;
but he will say, &lsquo;I am not a prophet;
I am a tiller of the ground,
for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And one will say to him,
&lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?&rsquo;
Then he will say,
&lsquo;<em>Those</em> with which I was wounded
in the house of my friends.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Awake, O sword,
against My Shepherd,
And against the man,
My Associate,&rdquo;
Declares the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;Strike the Shepherd
that the sheep may be scattered;
And I will turn My hand against the little ones.
&ldquo;It will come about in all the land,&rdquo;
Declares the LORD,
&ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off <em>and</em> perish;
But the third will be left in it.
&ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire,
Refine them as silver is refined,
And test them as gold is tested.
They will call on My name,
And I will answer them;
I will say, &lsquo;They are My people,&rsquo;
And they will say, &lsquo;The LORD is my God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Behold, a day is coming for the LORD
when the spoil taken from you
will be divided among you.
For I will gather all the nations
against Jerusalem to battle,
and the city will be captured,
the houses plundered,
the women ravished
and half of the city exiled,
but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.
Then the LORD will go forth
and fight against those nations,
as when He fights on a day of battle.
In that day
His feet will stand
on the Mount of Olives,
which is in front of Jerusalem
on the east;
and the Mount of Olives
will be split in its middle
from east to west
by a very large valley,
so that half of the mountain
will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.
You will flee by the valley of My mountains,
for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel;
yes, you will flee
just as you fled before the earthquake
in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.</p>
<p>Then the LORD, my God, will come,
<em>and</em> all the holy ones with Him!
In that day
there will be no light;
the luminaries will dwindle.
For it will be a unique day
which is known to the LORD,
neither day nor night,
but it will come about that at evening time
there will be light.
And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem,
half of them toward the eastern sea
and the other half toward the western sea;
it will be in summer
as well as in winter.
And the LORD will be king
over all the earth;
in that day
the LORD will be <em>the only</em> one,
and His name <em>the only</em> one.
All the land will be changed
into a plain from Geba
to Rimmon
south of Jerusalem;
but Jerusalem will rise
and remain on its site
from Benjamin&rsquo;s Gate
as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate,
and from the Tower of Hananel
to the king&rsquo;s wine presses.
People will live in it,
and there will no longer be a curse,
for Jerusalem will dwell in security.</p>
<p>Now this will be the plague
with which the LORD
will strike all the peoples
who have gone to war
against Jerusalem;
their flesh will rot
while they stand on their feet,
and their eyes will rot in their sockets,
and their tongue will rot in their mouth.
It will come about in that day
that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them;
and they will seize one another&rsquo;s hand,
and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem;
and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered,
gold and silver and garments
in great abundance.</p>
<p>So also like this plague
will be the plague
on the horse,
the mule,
the camel,
the donkey
and all the cattle that will be in those camps.</p>
<p>Then it will come about
that any
who are left of all the nations
that went against Jerusalem
will go up from year to year
to worship the King,
the LORD of hosts,
and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
And it will be that
whichever of the families
of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem
to worship the King,
the LORD of hosts,
there will be no rain on them.
If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter,
then no <em>rain will fall</em> on them;
it will be the plague
with which the LORD
smites the nations
who do not go up
to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
This will be the punishment of Egypt,
and the punishment of all the nations
who do not go up
to celebrate the Feast of Booths.
In that day
there will <em>be inscribed</em>
on the bells of the horses,
&ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.&rdquo;
And the cooking pots
in the LORD&rsquo;S house
will be like the bowls before the altar.
Every cooking pot
in Jerusalem and in Judah
will be holy to the LORD of hosts;
and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.
And there will no longer be a Canaanite
in the house of the LORD of hosts
in that day.</p>

(Phrased + Indented + Comments)</p>
<p>In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,
the word of the LORD came
to Zechariah the prophet,
the son of Berechiah,
the son of Iddo
saying,
&ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers.
&ldquo;Therefore say to them,
&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;Return to Me,&rdquo;
declares the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;that I may return to you,&rdquo;
says the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;Do not be like your fathers,
to whom the former prophets proclaimed,
saying,
&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;Return now from your evil ways
and from your evil deeds.&rdquo;&rsquo;
But they did not listen
or give heed to Me,&rdquo;
declares the LORD.
&ldquo;Your fathers, where are they?
And the prophets, do they live forever?
&ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes,
which I commanded My servants
the prophets,
overtake your fathers?
Then they repented and said,
&lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us
in accordance with our ways
and our deeds,
so He has dealt with us.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,
which is the month Shebat,
in the second year of Darius,
the word of the LORD came
to Zechariah
the prophet,
the son of Berechiah,
the son of Iddo,
as follows:
I saw at night,
and behold,
a man was riding
on a red horse,
and he was standing
among the myrtle trees
which were in the ravine,
with red, sorrel and white horses
behind him.
Then I said, &ldquo;My lord, what are these?&rdquo;
And the angel
who was speaking with me said to me,
&ldquo;I will show you what these are.&rdquo;
And the man
who was standing
among the myrtle trees
answered and said,
&ldquo;These are those
whom the LORD has sent
to patrol the earth.&rdquo;
So they answered the angel of the LORD
who was standing
among the myrtle trees
and said,
&ldquo;We have patrolled the earth,
and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>		Then the angel of the LORD said, 
				&quot;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion 
						for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, 
						with which You have been indignant these seventy years?&quot; 
		The LORD answered the angel 
				who was speaking with me 
		with gracious words, 
			comforting words. 
		So the angel 
				who was speaking with me 
		said to me, 
			&quot;Proclaim, saying, 
					'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
							&quot;I am exceedingly jealous 
										for Jerusalem and Zion. 
							&quot;But I am very angry with the nations 
										who are at ease; 
							for while I was only a little angry, 
							they furthered the disaster.&quot; 
									'Therefore thus says the LORD, 
											&quot;I will return to Jerusalem 
														with compassion; 
													My house will be built in it,&quot; 
														declares the LORD of hosts, 
														&quot;and a measuring line 
														will be stretched 
														over Jerusalem.&quot;' 
											&quot;Again, proclaim, saying, 
														'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
														&quot;My cities will again overflow 
														with prosperity, 
														and the LORD will again 
														comfort Zion 
														and again choose Jerusalem.&quot;'&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold,
<em>there were</em> four horns.
So I said to the angel
who was speaking with me,
&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo;
And he answered me,
&ldquo;These are the horns
which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.
I said, &ldquo;What are these coming to do?&rdquo;
And he said, &ldquo;These are the horns
which have scattered Judah
so that no man lifts up his head;
but these <em>craftsmen</em> have come
to terrify them,
to throw down the horns of the nations
who have lifted up <em>their</em>horns
against the land of Judah
in order to scatter it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes
and looked,
and behold,
<em>there was</em> a man
with a measuring line in his hand.
So I said, &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
And he said to me,
&ldquo;To measure Jerusalem,
to see how wide it is
and how long it is.&rdquo;
And behold, the angel
who was speaking with me
was going out,
and another angel
was coming out to meet him,
and said to him,
&ldquo;Run, speak to that young man,
saying, &lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls
because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.
&lsquo;For I,&rsquo; declares the LORD,
&lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her,
and I will be the glory in her midst.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,&rdquo;
declares the LORD,
&ldquo;for I have dispersed you
as the four winds of the heavens,&rdquo;
declares the LORD.
&ldquo;Ho, Zion!
Escape,
you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.&rdquo;
For thus says the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;After glory He has sent me
against the nations
which plunder you,
for he who touches you,
touches the apple of His eye.
&ldquo;For behold,
I will wave My hand over them
so that they will be plunder for their slaves.
Then you will know
that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.
&ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad,
O daughter of Zion;
for behold I am coming
and I will dwell in your midst,&rdquo;
declares the LORD.
&ldquo;Many nations will join themselves
to the LORD
in that day
and will become My people.
Then I will dwell in your midst,
and you will know
that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.
&ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah
as His portion in the holy land,
and will again choose Jerusalem.
&ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD;
for He is aroused from His holy habitation.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>Then he showed me Joshua 
		the high priest 
standing before the angel of the LORD, 
and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
	The LORD said to Satan, 
		&quot;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! 
		Indeed, the LORD 
		who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! 
		Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?&quot; 
Now Joshua was clothed 
with filthy garments 
and standing before the angel. 
He spoke and said to those 
who were standing before him, 
	saying, &quot;Remove the filthy garments from him.&quot; 
	Again he said to him, &quot;See, I have taken your iniquity away 
	from you and will clothe you with festal robes.&quot; 
Then I said, 
	&quot;Let them put a clean turban on his head.&quot; 
So they put a clean turban 
	on his head 
	and clothed him with garments, 
		while the angel of the LORD was standing by. 
		And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, 
				saying, 
					&quot;Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
						'If you will walk in My ways 
						and if you will perform My service, 
						then you will also govern My house 
						and also have charge of My courts, 
						and I will grant you free access among these 
								who are standing *here.* 
						'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, 
						you and your friends 
								who are sitting in front of you—
						indeed they are men who are a symbol, 
						for behold, I am going to bring in My servant 
							the Branch. 
						'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; 
							on one stone are seven eyes. 
						Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' 
						declares the LORD of hosts, 
						'and I will remove the iniquity 
						of that land in one day. 
						'In that day,' 
									declares the LORD of hosts, 
						'every one of you will invite his neighbor 
						to *sit* under *his* vine 
						and under *his* fig tree.'&quot; 
</code></pre>
<p>Then the angel
who was speaking with me
returned and roused me,
as a man who is awakened from his sleep.
He said to me,
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;
And I said,
&ldquo;I see, and behold,
a lampstand all of gold
with its bowl on the top of it,
and its seven lamps on it
with seven spouts
belonging to each of the lamps
which are on the top of it;
also two olive trees by it,
one on the right side of the bowl
and the other on its left side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I said to the angel
who was speaking with me saying,
&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;
So the angel
who was speaking with me
answered and said to me,
&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;
And I said,
&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said to me,
&ldquo;This is the word of the LORD
to Zerubbabel saying,
&lsquo;Not by might nor by power,
but by My Spirit,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts.
&lsquo;What are you, O great mountain?
Before Zerubbabel <em>you will become</em> a plain;
and he will bring forth the top stone
with shouts of &ldquo;Grace, grace to it!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;
Also the word of the LORD came to me,
saying,
&ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel
have laid the foundation of this house,
and his hands will finish <em>it.</em>
Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
&ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things?
But these seven will be glad
when they see the plumb line
in the hand of Zerubbabel—
<em>these are</em> the eyes of the LORD
which range to and fro
throughout the earth.&rdquo;
Then I said to him,
&ldquo;What are these two olive trees
on the right of the lampstand
and on its left?&rdquo;
And I answered the second time and said to him,
&ldquo;What are the two olive branches
which are beside the two golden pipes,
which empty the golden <em>oil</em> from themselves?&rdquo;
So he answered me, saying,
&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;
And I said,
&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;
Then he said,
&ldquo;These are the two anointed ones
who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked,
and behold, <em>there was</em> a flying scroll.
And he said to me,
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;
And I answered,
&ldquo;I see a flying scroll;
its length is twenty cubits
and its width ten cubits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said to me,
&ldquo;This is the curse
that is going forth over the face
of the whole land;
surely everyone who steals will be purged away
according to the writing on one side,
and everyone who swears
will be purged away
according to the writing on the other side.
&ldquo;I will make it go forth,&rdquo;
declares the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief
and the house of the one
who swears falsely by My name;
and it will spend the night
within that house
and consume it with its timber and stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the angel
who was speaking with me
went out and said to me,
&ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.&rdquo;
I said,
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
And he said,
&ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.&rdquo;
Again he said,
&ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land
(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up);
and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.&rdquo;
Then he said,
&ldquo;This is Wickedness!&rdquo;
And he threw her down
into the middle of the ephah
and cast the lead weight on its opening.</p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked,
and there two women
were coming out with the wind in their wings;
and they had wings
like the wings of a stork,
and they lifted up the ephah
between the earth and the heavens.
I said to the angel who was speaking with me,
&ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?&rdquo;
Then he said to me,
&ldquo;To build a temple for her
in the land of Shinar;
and when it is prepared,
she will be set there on her own pedestal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked,
and behold, four chariots were coming forth
from between the two mountains;
and the mountains <em>were</em> bronze mountains.
With the first chariot <em>were</em> red horses,
with the second chariot black horses,
with the third chariot white horses,
and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.
Then I spoke and said to the angel
who was speaking with me,
&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;
The angel replied to me,
&ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven,
going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,
with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country;
and the white ones go forth after them,
while the dappled ones go forth to the south country.
&ldquo;When the strong ones went out,
they were eager to go to patrol the earth.&rdquo;
And He said,
&ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.&rdquo;
So they patrolled the earth.
Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,
&ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.&rdquo;
The word of the LORD also came to me,
saying,
&ldquo;Take <em>an offering</em>
from the exiles,
from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah;
and you go the same day
and enter the house of Josiah
the son of Zephaniah,
where they have arrived from Babylon.
&ldquo;Take silver and gold,
make an <em>ornate</em> crown
and set <em>it</em>on the head of Joshua
the son of Jehozadak,
the high priest.
&ldquo;Then say to him,
&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;Behold, a man
whose name is Branch,
for He will branch out from where He is;
and He will build the temple of the LORD.
&ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD,
and He who will bear the honor
and sit and rule on His throne.
Thus, He will be a priest on His throne,
and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.&rdquo;&rsquo;
&ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder
in the temple of the LORD
to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen
the son of Zephaniah.
&ldquo;Those who are far off
will come and build the temple of the LORD.&rdquo;
Then you will know
that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.
And it will take place
if you completely obey the LORD your God.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of King Darius,
the word of the LORD came to Zechariah
on the fourth <em>day</em>
of the ninth month,
<em>which is</em> Chislev.
Now <em>the town of</em> Bethel
had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech
and their men
to seek the favor of the LORD,
speaking to the priests
who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts,
and to the prophets, saying,
&ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain,
as I have done these many years?&rdquo;
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
&ldquo;Say to all the people
of the land
and to the priests,
&lsquo;When you fasted and mourned
in the fifth and seventh months
these seventy years,
was it actually for Me that you fasted?
&lsquo;When you eat and drink,
do you not eat for yourselves
and do you not drink for yourselves?
&lsquo;Are not <em>these</em> the words
which the LORD proclaimed
by the former prophets,
when Jerusalem was inhabited
and prosperous
along with its cities around it,
and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah
saying,<br>
&ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said,
&lsquo;Dispense true justice
and practice kindness
and compassion each to his brother;
and do not oppress
the widow
or the orphan,
the stranger
or the poor;
and do not devise evil in your hearts
against one another.&rsquo;
&ldquo;But they refused to pay attention
and turned a stubborn shoulder
and stopped their ears from hearing.
&ldquo;They made their hearts <em>like</em> flint
so that they could not hear the law
and the words
which the LORD of hosts had sent
by His Spirit
through the former prophets;
therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen,
so they called and I would not listen,&rdquo;
says the LORD of hosts;
&ldquo;but I scattered them
with a storm wind
among all the nations
whom they have not known.
Thus the land is desolated behind them
so that no one went back and forth,
for they made the pleasant land desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion,
yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD,
&lsquo;I will return to Zion
and will dwell
in the midst of Jerusalem.
Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,
and the mountain of the LORD of hosts
*will be called *the Holy Mountain.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit
in the streets of Jerusalem,
each man with his staff in his hand
because of age.<br>
&lsquo;And the streets of the city
will be filled with boys and girls
playing in its streets.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;If it is too difficult
in the sight of the remnant of this people
in those days,
will it also be too difficult in My sight?&rsquo;
declares the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people
from the land of the east
and from the land of the west;
and I will bring them <em>back</em>
and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem;
and they shall be My people,
and I will be their God
in truth and righteousness.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Let your hands be strong,
you who are listening
in these days
to these words
from the mouth of the prophets,
<em>those</em> who <em>spoke</em>
in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid,
to the end that the temple might be built.
&lsquo;For before those days there was no wage
for man or any wage for animal;
and for him
who went out
or came in
there was no peace
because of his enemies,
and I set all men one against another.
&lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant
of this people
as in the former days,
&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.
&lsquo;For <em>there will be</em> peace
for the seed:
the vine will yield its fruit,
the land will yield its produce
and the heavens will give their dew;
and I will cause the remnant
of this people to inherit all these <em>things.</em>
&lsquo;It will come about
that just as you were a curse
among the nations,
O house of Judah and house of Israel,
so I will save you
that you may become a blessing.
Do not fear; let your hands be strong.&rsquo;
&ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you
when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,&rsquo;
says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;and I have not relented,
so I have again purposed
in these days
to do good to Jerusalem
and to the house of Judah.
Do not fear!
&lsquo;These are the things which you should do:
speak the truth to one another;
judge with truth and judgment
for peace in your gates.
&lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart
against another,
and do not love perjury;
for all these are what I hate,&rsquo;
declares the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;The fast of the fourth,
the fast of the fifth,
the fast of the seventh
and the fast of the tenth <em>months</em>
will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts
for the house of Judah;
so love truth and peace.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;<em>It will</em> yet <em>be</em> that peoples will come,
even the inhabitants of many cities.
&lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another,
saying,
&ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD,
and to seek the LORD of hosts;
I will also go.&rdquo;
&lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come
to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem
and to entreat the favor of the LORD.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,
&lsquo;In those days
ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew,
saying,
&ldquo;Let us go with you,
for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burden of the word of the LORD is against
the land of Hadrach,
with Damascus
as its resting place
(for the eyes of men,
especially of all the tribes of Israel,
are toward the LORD),
And Hamath also,
which borders on it;
Tyre and Sidon,
though they are very wise.
For Tyre built herself a fortress
And piled up silver like dust,
And gold like the mire of the streets.
Behold, the Lord will dispossess her
And cast her wealth into the sea;
And she will be consumed with fire.
Ashkelon will see <em>it</em> and be afraid.
Gaza too will writhe in great pain;
Also Ekron,
for her expectation has been confounded.
Moreover,
the king will perish from Gaza,
And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.
And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod,
And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
And I will remove their blood from their mouth
And their detestable things from between their teeth.
Then they also will be a remnant for our God,
And be like a clan in Judah,
And Ekron like a Jebusite.
But I will camp around My house
because of an army,
Because of him who passes by and returns;
And no oppressor will pass over them anymore,
For now I have seen with My eyes.
Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!
Shout <em>in triumph,</em>
O daughter of Jerusalem!
Behold, your king is coming to you;
He is just
and endowed with salvation,
Humble,
and mounted on a donkey,
Even on a colt,
the foal of a donkey.
I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
And the horse from Jerusalem;
And the bow of war will be cut off.
And He will speak peace to the nations;
And His dominion will be from sea to sea,
And from the River to the ends of the earth.
As for you also,
because of the blood of <em>My</em> covenant with you,
I have set your prisoners free
from the waterless pit.
Return to the stronghold,
O prisoners who have the hope;
This very day
I am declaring
that I will restore double to you.
For I will bend Judah as My bow,
I will fill the bow with Ephraim.
And I will stir up your sons, O Zion,
against your sons,
O Greece;
And I will make you like a warrior&rsquo;s sword.
Then the LORD will appear over them,
And His arrow will go forth like lightning;
And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet,
And will march in the storm winds of the south.
The LORD of hosts will defend them.
And they will devour and trample on the sling stones;
And they will drink <em>and</em>be boisterous as with wine;
And they will be filled like a <em>sacrificial</em> basin,
<em>Drenched</em> like the corners of the altar.
And the LORD their God will save them
in that day
As the flock of His people;
For <em>they are as</em> the stones of a crown,
Sparkling in His land.
For what comeliness and beauty <em>will be</em> theirs!
Grain will make the young men flourish,
and new wine the virgins.
Ask rain from the LORD
at the time of the spring rain—
The LORD who makes the storm clouds;
And He will give them showers of rain,
vegetation in the field to <em>each</em> man.
For the teraphim speak iniquity,
And the diviners
see lying visions
And tell false dreams;
They comfort in vain.
Therefore <em>the people</em> wander like sheep,
They are afflicted,
because there is no shepherd.
&ldquo;My anger is kindled
against the shepherds,
And I will punish the male goats;
For the LORD of hosts
has visited His flock,
the house of Judah,
And will make them
like His majestic horse in battle.
&ldquo;From them
will come the cornerstone,
From them
the tent peg,
From them
the bow of battle,
From them
every ruler,
<em>all</em> of them
together.
&ldquo;They will be as mighty men,
Treading down <em>the enemy</em>
in the mire of the streets in battle;
And they will fight,
for the LORD <em>will be</em> with them;
And the riders on horses will be put to shame.
&ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah,
And I will save the house of Joseph,
And I will bring them back,
Because I have had compassion on them;
And they will be as though I had not rejected them,
For I am the LORD their God
and I will answer them.
&ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man,
And their heart will be glad
as if <em>from</em> wine;
Indeed, their children will see <em>it</em> and be glad,
Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.
&ldquo;I will whistle for them
to gather them together,
For I have redeemed them;
And they will be as numerous as they were before.
&ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples,
They will remember Me in far countries,
And they
with their children
will live and come back.
&ldquo;I will bring them back
from the land of Egypt
And gather them from Assyria;
And I will bring them
into the land of Gilead
and Lebanon
Until no <em>room</em> can be found for them.
&ldquo;And they will pass
through the sea <em>of</em> distress
And He will strike the waves in the sea,
So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up;
And the pride of Assyria will be brought down
And the scepter of Egypt will depart.
&ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD,
And in His name they will walk,&rdquo;
declares the LORD.
Open your doors, O Lebanon,
That a fire may feed on your cedars.
Wail, O cypress,
for the cedar has fallen,
Because the glorious <em>trees</em> have been destroyed;
Wail, O oaks of Bashan,
For the impenetrable forest has come down.
There is a sound of the shepherds&rsquo; wail,
For their glory is ruined;
There is a sound of the young lions&rsquo; roar,
For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.
Thus says the LORD my God,
&ldquo;Pasture the flock
<em>doomed</em> to slaughter.
&ldquo;Those who buy them
slay them and go unpunished,
and <em>each of</em> those
who sell them says,
&lsquo;Blessed be the LORD,
for I have become rich!&rsquo;
And their own shepherds have no pity on them.
&ldquo;For I will no longer have pity
on the inhabitants of the land,&rdquo;
declares the LORD;
&ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall,
each into another&rsquo;s power
and into the power of his king;
and they will strike the land,
and I will not deliver <em>them</em> from their power.&rdquo;
So I pastured the flock
<em>doomed</em> to slaughter,
hence the afflicted of the flock.
And I took for myself two staffs:
the one I called Favor
and the other I called Union;
so I pastured the flock.
Then I annihilated the three shepherds
in one month,
for my soul was impatient with them,
and their soul also was weary of me.
Then I said, &ldquo;I will not pasture you.
What is to die, let it die,
and what is to be annihilated,
let it be annihilated;
and let those who are left
eat one another&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo;
I took my staff Favor
and cut it in pieces,
to break my covenant
which I had made with all the peoples.
So it was broken on that day,
and thus the afflicted of the flock
who were watching me
realized that it was the word of the LORD.
I said to them,
&ldquo;If it is good in your sight,
give <em>me</em> my wages;
but if not, never mind!&rdquo;
So they weighed out thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver as my wages.
Then the LORD said to me,
&ldquo;Throw it to the potter,
<em>that</em> magnificent price
at which I was valued by them.&rdquo;
So I took the thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver
and threw them to the potter
in the house of the LORD.
Then I cut in pieces
my second staff Union,
to break the brotherhood
between Judah and Israel.
The LORD said to me,
&ldquo;Take again for yourself
the equipment of a foolish shepherd.
&ldquo;For behold,
I am going to raise up a shepherd
in the land
who will not care for the perishing,
seek the scattered,
heal the broken,
or sustain the one standing,
but will devour the flesh of the fat <em>sheep</em> and tear off their hoofs.
&ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd
Who leaves the flock!
A sword will be on his arm
And on his right eye!
His arm will be totally withered
And his right eye will be blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burden of the word of the LORD
concerning Israel.
<em>Thus</em> declares the LORD
who stretches out the heavens,
lays the foundation of the earth,
and forms the spirit of man within him,
&ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem
a cup that causes reeling
to all the peoples around;
and when the siege is against Jerusalem,
it will also be against Judah.
&ldquo;It will come about
in that day
that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone
for all the peoples;
all who lift it will be severely injured.
And all the nations of the earth
will be gathered against it.
&ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; declares the LORD,
&ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment
and his rider with madness.
But I will watch over the house of Judah,
while I strike every horse of the peoples
with blindness.
&ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts,
&lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem
through the LORD of hosts, their God.&rsquo;
&ldquo;In that day
I will make the clans of Judah
like a firepot
among pieces of wood
and a flaming torch among sheaves,
so they will consume on the right hand
and on the left all the surrounding peoples,
while the inhabitants of Jerusalem
again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.
&ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,
so that the glory of the house of David
and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem
will not be magnified above Judah.
&ldquo;In that day
the LORD will defend
the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and the one who is feeble among them
in that day will be like David,
and the house of David <em>will be</em> like God,
like the angel of the LORD before them.
&ldquo;And in that day
I will set about
to destroy all the nations
that come against Jerusalem.
&ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David
and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the Spirit of grace
and of supplication,
so that they will look on Me
whom they have pierced;
and they will mourn for Him,
as one mourns for an only son,
and they will weep bitterly over Him
like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.
&ldquo;In that day
there will be great mourning
in Jerusalem,
like the mourning of Hadadrimmon
in the plain of Megiddo.
&ldquo;The land will mourn,
every family by itself;
the family of the house of David
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the house of Nathan
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the house of Levi
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the Shimeites
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
all the families
that remain,
every family
by itself
and their wives
by themselves.
&ldquo;In that day
a fountain will be opened
for the house of David and
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
for sin and for impurity.
&ldquo;It will come about in that day,&rdquo;
declares the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;that I will cut off
the names of the idols
from the land,
and they
will no longer be remembered;
and I will also remove the prophets
and the unclean spirit
from the land.
&ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies,
then his father and mother
who gave birth to him
will say to him,
&lsquo;You shall not live,
for you have spoken
falsely
in the name of the LORD&rsquo;;
and his father and mother
who gave birth to him
will pierce him through
when he prophesies.
&ldquo;Also it will come about
in that day
that the prophets
will each be ashamed
of his vision when he prophesies,
and they will not put on
a hairy robe
in order to deceive;
but he will say,
&lsquo;I am not a prophet;
I am a tiller of the ground,
for a man sold me
as a slave in my youth.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And one will say to him,
&lsquo;What are these wounds
between your arms?&rsquo;
Then he will say,
&lsquo;<em>Those</em> with which I was wounded
in the house of my friends.&rsquo;
&ldquo;Awake, O sword,
against My Shepherd,
And against the man,
My Associate,&rdquo;
Declares the LORD of hosts.
&ldquo;Strike the Shepherd
that the sheep may be scattered;
And I will turn My hand against the little ones.
&ldquo;It will come about in all the land,&rdquo;
Declares the LORD,
&ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off <em>and</em> perish;
But the third will be left in it.
&ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire,
Refine them
as silver is refined,
And test them
as gold is tested.
They will call on My name,
And I will answer them;
I will say, &lsquo;They are My people,&rsquo;
And they will say, &lsquo;The LORD is my God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Behold, a day is coming for the LORD
when the spoil taken from you
will be divided among you.
For I will gather all the nations
against Jerusalem
to battle,
and the city will be captured,
the houses plundered,
the women ravished
and half of the city exiled,
but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.
Then the LORD will go forth
and fight
against those nations,
as when He fights on a day of battle.
In that day
His feet will stand
on the Mount of Olives,
which is in front of Jerusalem
on the east;
and the Mount of Olives
will be split in its middle
from east to west
by a very large valley,
so that half of the mountain
will move toward the north
and the other half toward the south.
You will flee
by the valley of My mountains,
for the valley of the mountains
will reach to Azel;
yes, you will flee
just as you fled before the earthquake
in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.</p>
<p>Then the LORD, my God, will come,
<em>and</em> all the holy ones with Him!
In that day
there will be no light;
the luminaries will dwindle.
For it will be a unique day
which is known to the LORD,
neither day nor night,
but it will come about
that at evening time
there will be light.
And in that day
living waters will flow out of Jerusalem,
half of them
toward the eastern sea
and the other half
toward the western sea;</p>
<p><code>Zechariah 14:8-11 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. (9) And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one... People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Isaiah 11:9-10 They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea. (10) Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious. Isaiah 60:18-20 No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. (19) The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. (20) Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.</code></p>
<p>​			it will be in summer
​			as well as in winter. <code>what does this mean? does it happen in summer and winter simultaneously? Probably not since Jerusalem is the center? This is probably referring to the amount of time...lingering on from summer and going into the winter.</code>
​		And the LORD will be king
​			over all the earth;
​		in that day
​			the LORD will be <em>the only</em> one,
​			and His name <em>the only</em> one.
​			All the land will be changed
​					into a plain
​							from Geba
​							to Rimmon
​							south of Jerusalem;
​					but Jerusalem will rise
​									and remain on its site
​									from Benjamin&rsquo;s Gate
​									as far as the place
​											of the First Gate
​											to the Corner Gate,
​									and from the Tower of Hananel
​											to the king&rsquo;s wine presses.
​							People will live in it,
​								and there will no longer be a curse,
​								for Jerusalem will dwell in security.</p>
<p>Now this will be the plague
with which the LORD
will strike all the peoples
who have gone to war
against Jerusalem;
their flesh will rot
while they stand on their feet,
and their eyes will rot
in their sockets,
and their tongue will rot
in their mouth.
It will come about in that day
that a great panic
from the LORD
will fall on them; <code>against those who have gone against Jerusalem</code>
and they will seize one another&rsquo;s hand,
and the hand of one will be lifted
against the hand of another.
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem;
and the wealth of all the surrounding nations
will be gathered,
gold
and silver
and garments
in great abundance.</p>
<p>So also like this plague
will be the plague
on the horse,
the mule,
the camel,
the donkey
and all the cattle
that will be in those camps.</p>
<p>Then it will come about
that any
who are left of all the nations
that went against Jerusalem
will go up from year to year
to worship
the King,
the LORD of hosts,
and to celebrate
the Feast of Booths.
And it will be that
whichever of the families
of the earth
does not go up to Jerusalem
to worship
the King,
the LORD of hosts,
there will be no rain on them.
If the family of Egypt
does not go up or enter,
then no <em>rain will fall</em> on them;
it will be the plague
with which the LORD
smites the nations
who do not go up
to celebrate
the Feast of Booths.
This will be the punishment
of Egypt,
and the punishment
of all the nations
who do not go up
to celebrate the Feast of Booths. <code>When God gave the law, he commanded that Israel should live in tents or booths during the feast on the seventh month (Tishri). Nehemiah 8:14</code>
<code>For seven days, starting the fifteenth day of the seventh month Israel was to have a feast. During this time, they were to dwell in tents or booths. Leviticus 23:16, 34 This was a feast of celebration after the harvest was gathered. Deuteronomy 16:13</code>
<code>This feast is mentioned in Zechariah 3 times and only near the end of chapter 14. Zechariah 14:16, 18-19</code>
<code>The feast of booths/tabernacles was celebrated after the harvest. During the Millenial reign of Christ, not only will Israel but all of the nations will come to celebrate the great havest of souls. This may be the connection with the 70 bulls that were sacrificed and symbolized the 70 Gentiles nations of Genesis 10. Numbers 29:12-34</code></p>
<p>In that day
there will <em>be inscribed</em>
on the bells of the horses,
&ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.&rdquo;
And the cooking pots
in the LORD&rsquo;S house
will be like the bowls before the altar.
Every cooking pot
in Jerusalem and in Judah
will be holy to the LORD of hosts;
and all who sacrifice
will come
and take of them
and boil in them.
And there will no longer be a Canaanite
in the house of the LORD of hosts
in that day.
&lsquo;What a strange last statement to make before finishing up the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promises. Surely this had to be hopeful news, but why? Why are the Canaanites singled out?</p>

</h1><p>(Chronology + Conversation)</p>
<p>In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. &ldquo;Therefore say to them, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;Return to Me,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;that I may return to you,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. &ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.&rdquo;&rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,&rdquo; declares the LORD. &ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? &ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, &lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.</p>
<p>Then I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, what are these?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you what these are.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the angel of the LORD said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Proclaim, saying, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. &ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.&rdquo; &lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, &ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.&rdquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, <em>there were</em> four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he answered me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these coming to do?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these <em>craftsmen</em> have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up <em>their</em>horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, <em>there was</em> a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, &lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. &lsquo;For I,&rsquo; declares the LORD, &lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.&rsquo;&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,&rdquo; declares the LORD, &ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,&rdquo; declares the LORD. &ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.&rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. &ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. &ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,&rdquo; declares the LORD. &ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. &ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. &ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.&rdquo; Again he said to him, &ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing <em>here.</em> &lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. &lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. &lsquo;In that day,&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to <em>sit</em> under <em>his</em> vine and under <em>his</em> fig tree.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, &lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. &lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel <em>you will become</em> a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of &ldquo;Grace, grace to it!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish <em>it.</em> Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. &ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—<em>these are</em> the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?&rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, &ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden <em>oil</em> from themselves?&rdquo; So he answered me, saying, &ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, <em>there was</em> a flying scroll. And he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I answered,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. &ldquo;I will make it go forth,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.&rdquo; Again he said, &ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;This is Wickedness!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.</p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p>I said to the angel who was speaking with me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains <em>were</em> bronze mountains. With the first chariot <em>were</em> red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.</p>
<p>Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The angel replied to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. &ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.&rdquo; And He said, &ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.&rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Take <em>an offering</em> from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. &ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an <em>ornate</em> crown and set <em>it</em>on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. &quot; Then say to him, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. &ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.&rdquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. &ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth <em>day</em> of the ninth month, <em>which is</em> Chislev. Now <em>the town of</em> Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, &lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? &lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? &lsquo;Are not <em>these</em> the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, &lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.&rsquo; &ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. &ldquo;They made their hearts <em>like</em> flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. &ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; &ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.&rsquo; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD, &lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts <em>will be called</em> the Holy Mountain.&rsquo; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.  &lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.&rsquo; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them <em>back</em> and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.&rsquo; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, <em>those</em> who <em>spoke</em> in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. &lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. &lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. &lsquo;For <em>there will be</em> peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these <em>things.</em> &lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.&rsquo; &ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! &lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. &lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,&rsquo; declares the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth <em>months</em> will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.&rsquo; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;<em>It will</em> yet <em>be</em> that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. &lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, &ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.&rdquo; &lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.&rsquo; &ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, &ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see <em>it</em> and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout <em>in triumph,</em> O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of <em>My</em> covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior&rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink <em>and</em>be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a <em>sacrificial</em>basin, <em>Drenched</em> like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For <em>they are as</em> the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty <em>will be</em> theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to <em>each</em> man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore <em>the people</em> wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. &ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. &ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, <em>all</em>of them together. &ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down <em>the enemy</em>in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD <em>will be</em> with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. &ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. &ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if <em>from</em> wine; Indeed, their children will see <em>it</em> and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. &ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. &ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. &ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no <em>room</em> can be found for them. &ldquo;And they will pass through the sea <em>of</em> distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. &ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,&rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious <em>trees</em> have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds&rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions&rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, &ldquo;Pasture the flock <em>doomed</em> to slaughter. &ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and <em>each of</em> those who sell them says, &lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!&rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. &ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,&rdquo; declares the LORD; &ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another&rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver <em>them</em> from their power.&rdquo; So I pastured the flock <em>doomed</em> to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, &ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, &ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give <em>me</em> my wages; but if not, never mind!&rdquo; So they weighed out thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver as my wages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it to the potter, <em>that</em> magnificent price at which I was valued by them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I took the thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</p>
<p>The LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. &ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat <em>sheep</em> and tear off their hoofs. &ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. <em>Thus</em> declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. &ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. &ldquo;In that day,&rdquo; declares the LORD, &ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. &ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, &lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.&rsquo; &ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. &ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. &ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David <em>will be</em> like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. &ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. &ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. &ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. &ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. &ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. &ldquo;It will come about in that day,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. &ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, &lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD&rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. &ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, &lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.&rsquo; &ldquo;And one will say to him, &lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?&rsquo; Then he will say, &lsquo;<em>Those</em> with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.&rsquo; &ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,&rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. &ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. &ldquo;It will come about in all the land,&rdquo; Declares the LORD, &ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off <em>and</em> perish; But the third will be left in it. &ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, &lsquo;They are My people,&rsquo; And they will say, &lsquo;The LORD is my God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, <em>and</em> all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be <em>the only</em> one, and His name <em>the only</em> one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin&rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king&rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another&rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no <em>rain will fall</em> on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will <em>be inscribed</em> on the bells of the horses, &ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.&rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD&rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.</p>

<p>Message #1 - God says, &ldquo;Return to ME!&rdquo;</p>
<p><code>- *(Year 2, month 8 of Darius)*</code></p>
<p>In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, <code>520BC. dates are given based on the ruling gentile king. There is no king of Israel or Judah at this time. Zerubbabel is governor. The line of David is off the throne, and the Times of the Gentiles are in progress. (Luke 21:24, Rom 11:25). The eighth month was called Bul (1 Kings 6:38) but after exile evidently Marcheshvan - &quot;rainy&quot; (Josephus).</code></p>
<p>the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, <code>“The second year of Darius” is the same year in which Haggai prophesied. Haggai was given a prophecy in September (to begin rebuilding temple), October (Hag 2), and December, but none in November. So this man Zechariah was given a prophecy in November, the month Haggai missed. Two months before this message, they had began to rebuild the temple. One month before, they were discouraged. Haggai gave them an encouraging message of hope (Hag 2). - Zechariah is mentioned as head of the family (Neh 12:4++). This means in 520 Zechariah was probably a young man. Zechariah was a prophet - this was his rank.</code></p>
<p>the son of Berechiah, <code>(Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - Yahweh blesses</code></p>

</h6><p>the son of Iddo saying, <code>(Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - grandfather of Zechariah. One of the priests/levites who returned from Babylon (Neh 12:4, Neh 12:16)</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. &quot; <code>70 years exile is proof. Zechariah makes it clear, the reason they were in captivity was because they had displeased the Lord.</code></p>
<p>Therefore say to them,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, <code>LORD of hosts - 52x in Zechariah. The way it is used it “implies the boundless resources at His command for His people's good&quot;- fausset. He is rich in mercy (Eph 2:4). He is rich in power (Matt 28:18). This is some false prophet. This is a message from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to the importance of the message. APP: What does God have to say about this/that? </code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Return to Me,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, <code>invitation to a spiritual return at the time of a physical return. In the midst of physical returning, God invites Judah into a relationship, not religious rote.</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;that I may return to you,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. <code>This is clearly Zechariah emphasizing God's continual offer of forgiveness. The Lord of hosts would return to be theirs upon their return to HIM, not to the land! Q: were the people thinking all was well because they were back in the land? Once they rebuilt the temple, would they think God had returned to them? Was their religion what God looked for?</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, <code>former prophets: Hosea. Joel. Amos. Isaiah. Jeremiah. This is important to the message of Zechariah - God spoke to the people through the prophets of old. The people did not listen, therefore they were wrong and God was angered. They were exiled. Zechariah is appealing to the people...look what happened when God (through the prophets of old) was not listened to. Now listen to God as He speaks through me.</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, <code>It's not Zechariah's word, it's the Lord of host</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.</strong>&rdquo;&rsquo; <code>This can be better understood in the light of what Haggai says in Hag 2:10-14. Two ways to understand men of old: through the lens of religion and the dogmas they enforced and try to replicate the formula to produce the same results. The other lens is to understand what God was doing at a specific time through failed people and simple learn from the past within it's specific time. How can that apply to us today? The latter is the correct lens.</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But they did not listen or give heed to Me,&rdquo; declares the LORD.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? &quot; <code>The fathers were dead. The prophets were dead and their message died with them. Did God keep speaking the same message (through the same prophets) forever? NO! God was patient but not passive. </code></p>
<p>But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? <code>The anticipated answer is, YES!</code></p>
<p>Then they repented and said, <code>they repented: (SHUB - return) this is not the same meaning as METANOIA in NT. This means simply to return. Religious or otherwise. It is often assumed SHUB is the same as METANOIA. They are not. Acts 26:20 shows METANOIA is not return.</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.&rsquo;&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; <code>Jeremiah 23:20 **&quot;The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.**  Mal 3:7&quot;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them.

<p><strong>Vision #1 - The Horseman</strong></p>
<p><code>God watches the nations. God will rebuild Jerusalem and the temple</code></p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,</p>
<p>which is the month Shebat, <code>the month is named this time. Is there a reason?</code></p>
<p>in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:</p>
<p>I saw at night, <code>a vision at night</code></p>
<p>and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, <code>No explanation is given as tot he colours of the horses. a red horse, is it death, war?</code></p>
<p>and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, <code>Myrtle trees are seen as blessing from God in Isaiah 55:1-13. God will turn briars into myrtle trees.  The fact that this rider is standing among myrtle trees in the ravine speaks of blessing.</code></p>
<p>with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. <code>red horse, sorrel (brown), white horses</code></p>
<p>Then I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, what are these?&rdquo; <code>An angel was also there</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, <code>This angel is similar to Gabriel who came to explain the meaning of the visions</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you what these are.&rdquo; <code>The interpreting angel says, &quot;i will show you. I will explain to you&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, <code>now the man on the red horse speaks</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.&rdquo; <code>Are there always those patroling the earth? Is this a one-time event?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, <code>they? The red horse and white horses? Angel of the Lord, man on the red horse, man standing among the myrtle trees. Same person?</code></p>
<p><code>THE ANGEL OF THE LORD: (6x in Zechariah). This “man among the myrtle trees” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times made temporary preincarnate appearances on earth. As the Angel of the Lord, the Son of God appeared to </code>
<code>Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), </code>
<code>Abraham (18; 22:11–18), </code>
<code>Jacob (31:11, 13), </code>
<code>Moses (Ex. 3), </code>
<code>Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23), </code>
<code>Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.&rdquo; <code>These horsemen answer to the angel of the Lord. When is the earth peaceful and quiet? In relation to what? Evidently in relation to the defense/prosperity of Jerusalem. The nations were at ease.This is wrong since the Jews are not in the land. </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the angel of the LORD said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?&rdquo; <code>The Angel of the Lord answers to God the Father. In this case he intercedes for the people...&quot;how long?&quot;. The events of the vision take place after the 70 years in exile. The expectation is the reconquering (compassion) of the land. </code></p>
<p><code>For centuries, “How long?” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Ps. 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “How long?” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven (Rev. 6:10). That the Son of God should so identify Himself with the cries of His people reveals His compassion and concern. “In all their distress he too was distressed” (Isa. 63:9 niv).- wiersbe</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.<code>Zechariah makes mention of the mercy in the Lord's words. This is the nature of all prophecy. IT is to bring hope and comfort to the reader.</code></p>
<p>So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, <code>this is the interpreting angel. </code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Proclaim, saying, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, <code>this was to be what Zechariah was to tell the people. &quot;NOTICE: proclaim...the message God gave him&quot;</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. <code>Jerusalem and Zion are distinguished here. Possibly the city vs the holy mountain Psa 2:6, Isa 10:32, Mic 3:12, Mic 4:1-2</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.&rdquo; <code>The Lord said this would happen and had even promised to punish the Chaldeans for their harsh treatment of the Jews. HAB 2:8</code></p>
<p>&lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.&rdquo;&rsquo; <code>what is a measuring line? You can't measure something that isn't there. My house (temple #2) will be built. Zechariah 4:10 </code></p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, &lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; <code>The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, especially Jerusalem</code></p>

<p><strong>Vision #2 - Four Horns</strong></p>
<p><code>God concerns himself with the four gentile nations  who have risen against Israel and Judah</code></p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, <em>there were</em> four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, <code>horns are generally empires or powers</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he answered me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.&rdquo; <code>four horns, IF ISRAEL and if this deals with the period up to that time, then (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Medo-Persia?). If 4 horns of Daniel and after 70x7 then it deals with the 4 horns from the times of the Gentiles starting with Babylon. A key interpretive phrase is &quot;have scattered...&quot;Does this deal with Zechariah's past or from Zechariah's vision's past? </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, <code>Zechariah was shown 4 craftsmen. What are craftsmen? 1. Blacksmiths 2. Carpenters 3. Masons 4. Warriors 5. Jewelers. 2 Kings 22:6 distinguishes craftsmen from masons. 2 kings 24:16 mentions &quot;1000 craftsmen...strong and fit for war&quot;. 2 Chr 24:12 mentions craftsmen who were hired to rebuild the temple. Isa 40:19-20 connects craftsmen to idol makers. Isa 54:16 God makes the smith (craftsmen) to form the weapons out of iron. Nebuchadnezzar took all the crafstmen to Babylon. Eze 21:31 seems to refer to craftsmen as leaders, brutal men skilled in destruction. It does appear at first glance that God wants Zechariah to know the four horns are dealt with so as to not be discouraged.</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these coming to do?&rdquo; <code>It is good when Zechariah asks questions for us becuase he generally gets an answer. He asks not who are they but what are they coming to do, so Zechariah's curiosity is in regards to their purpose. If 70 years then these 4 craftsmen already came. If 70x7 then the 4 craftsmen could be during the tribulation?  </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said, <code>the interpreting angel</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these <em>craftsmen</em> have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up <em>their</em> horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.&rdquo; <code>four craftsmen? What they're doing is answered: To terrify the four horns...to throw them down. Evidently their identity is not important. Their purpose and is.Psa 75:10</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vision #3 - The Man Measuring the Temple</strong></p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, <em>there was</em> a man with a measuring line in his hand. <code>Similar scene to Rev 11 except this is in referince to the city not the temple.  </code></p>
<p>So I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; <code>Not what are you doing, but where are you going? The man seems to be walking away somewhere not evident to Zechariah, perhaps because at the time there was no city to speak of, it was in ruins.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.&rdquo; <code>not measuring the temple as Rev 11 but Jersusalem. What was the state of Jerusalem at the time?&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, <code>what angel is going to measure with the man? Where is the angel 'coming out' from? Coming out from the city? </code></p>
<p><code>A note about the status of Jerusalem at this point in history:</code>
<code>Jerusalem was destoyed: Jeremiah 26;18, 2 Chro 36:17-21, Eze 33:21 </code></p>
<p><code>Jerusalem will be rebuilt: </code></p>
<p><code>Temple will be rebuilt within 4 years (by the sixth year of king Darius): Ezra 6:14-15</code>
<code> under Zerubbabel:  2 Chr 36:22-23, Zechariah 4:9</code></p>
<p><code>Jerusalem walls rebuilt: Neh 2:3, Neh 2:17</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, <code>Zechariah is refered to as young man by the new angel.</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. &lsquo;For I,&rsquo; declares the LORD, &lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.&rsquo;&rdquo;  &ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,&rdquo; declares the LORD, &ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,&rdquo; declares the LORD. &ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.&rdquo; <code>The Lord will cause Jerusalem to be rebuilt (inhabited).2 Chr 36:22-23, Neh 2</code></p>
<p>For thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. <code>Genesis 12</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them <code>THE NATIONS will feel the wave of the hand of God over them</code></p>
<p>so that they will be plunder for their slaves. <code>Calamity due to their slaves - the jews.</code></p>
<p>Then you <code>Judah</code></p>
<p>will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. <code>Is Jesus speaking? It's no doubt when it happens. God did it. They would know it.</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,&rdquo; declares the LORD. <code>Emanuel? God with us? John 1:14, Mat 4:13-17. This is true of the first coming but ultimately fullfiled in the second coming. As we see following... </code></p>
<p>&ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD <strong>in that day</strong> and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. <code>At first glance this could be refering to Jesus' first coming but it says (after the nations join), then I will dwell...this must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst. In that day...</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. <code>Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, your kingdom come.</code></p>
<p>&ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.&rdquo;  <code>Isa 62:1-4</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vision #4 - Joshua the High Priest</strong></p>
<p><code>Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35</code>
<code>Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when &quot;the Branch&quot; rules</code></p>
<p>Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! <code>the Lord said Satan. This must be Jesus rebuking Satan</code></p>
<p>Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! <code>Satan is not after Joshua, but who Joshua represents - Israel</code></p>
<p>Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, <code>Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments?</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.&rdquo; Again he said to him, &ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.&rdquo; <code>This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.&rdquo; <code>Perhaps the obvious next step, &quot;don't forget the turban!!&quot;. Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on...</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they <code>who, the angels?</code></p>
<p>put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing <em>here.</em> <code>Notice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here...&quot;IF you will walk...then you will govern my house&quot;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.</code></p>
<p>&lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, <code>&quot;your friends&quot; in other words, religious leaders - these the priests, pharisees, saducees?</code></p>
<p>for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. <code>clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jer 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13</code></p>
<p>&lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. <code>THis addition is very interesting...&quot;before Joshua&quot; the stone. The cornerstone.  The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6</code></p>
<p>Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, <code>inscription on the rock?</code></p>
<p>&lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. &lsquo;<strong>In that day</strong>,&rsquo; <code>this is Messianic prophecy</code></p>
<p>declares the LORD of hosts, &rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to <em>sit</em> under <em>his</em> vine and under <em>his</em> fig tree.&rsquo;&rdquo; <code>rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Hab 3:17</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vision #5 - The Lampstand</strong></p>
<p>Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, <code>Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to state was he saw.</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, <code>a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks</code></p>
<p>and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; <code>Ex 25:37</code></p>
<p>also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said to me, <code>particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, <code>a specific message to Zerubbabel...</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. <code>certainly contrary to those who say, &quot;ease does not produce strength&quot;. Grace is what teaches us (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are to be strenghtened by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2)</code></p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel <em>you will become</em> a plain; <code>nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! </code></p>
<p>and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of  &ldquo;Grace, grace to it!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo; <code>The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vision #6 - Two Annointed Ones</strong></p>
<p>Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish <em>it.</em> Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. <code>Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God. </code></p>
<p>&ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—<code>a plumb line is used for building. </code></p>
<p><em>these are</em> the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.&rdquo; <code>the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?&rdquo; <code>First he asks what are the olive TREES</code></p>
<p>And I answered the second time and said to him, &ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden <em>oil</em> from themselves?&rdquo; <code>Now he asks what are the olive BRANCHES. the two witnesses from Revelation?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So he answered me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know what these are?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.&rdquo; <code>Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, <em>there was</em> a flying scroll. And he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I answered,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.&rdquo; <code>the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; <code>tribulation?</code></p>
<p>surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make it go forth,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; <code>the justice of God - he will make it go forth.</code></p>
<p>and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.&rdquo; <code>total consumption</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.&rdquo; Again he said, &ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;This is Wickedness!&rdquo; <code>is this the harlot Babylon?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. <code>Rev 17-18?</code></p>
<p><strong>Vision #7 - Two Winged Women serve &lsquo;her&rsquo; to build a temple in Shinar</strong></p>
<p>Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p>I said to the angel who was speaking with me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To build a temple for her <code>the harlot Babylon</code></p>
<p>in the land of Shinar; <code>a return to Babel</code></p>
<p>and when it is prepared, <code>The temple</code></p>
<p>she will be set there on her own pedestal.&rdquo; <code>a temple will be built in Babylon</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vision #8 - Four Chariots</strong></p>
<p>Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; <code>the two mountains?</code></p>
<p>and the mountains <em>were</em> bronze mountains. With the first chariot <em>were</em> red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. <code>Very similar to the 4 horsemen in Revelation</code></p>
<p>Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What are these, my lord?&rdquo; <code>not where or who but what. Later we are told these respond to the angel of the Lord. Are they angels sent to patrol and appear to Zech as chariots? </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The angel replied to me, <code>not the angel of the Lord, but the interpreting angel</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,</p>
<p>with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; <code>drought? Famine?</code></p>
<p>and the white ones go forth after them, <code>false conquest? Antichrist?</code></p>
<p>while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. ``</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And He said, &ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.&rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.&rdquo; <code>does this imply repentance or justice served?</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Take <em>an offering</em> from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an <em>ornate</em> crown and set <em>it</em> on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. &quot; <code>why would the high priest wear the crown?</code></p>
<p>Then say to him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. &ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.&rdquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. &ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.</p>
<p>Message #3</p>
<p><code>*(year 4, month 9 [Chislev] of Darius)*</code></p>
<p>In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth <em>day</em> of the ninth month, <em>which is</em> Chislev.</p>
<p>Now <em>the town of</em> Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, &lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? &lsquo;Are not <em>these</em> the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, &lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made their hearts <em>like</em> flint</p>
<p>so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets;</p>
<p>therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. &ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,&rdquo; says the LORD of hosts;</p>
<p>&ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known.</p>
<p>Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.  &lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them <em>back</em> and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people,</p>
<p>and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Let your hands be strong, <code>by His spirit</code></p>
<p>you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets,</p>
<p><em>those</em> who <em>spoke</em> in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,&rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. &lsquo;For <em>there will be</em> peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these <em>things.</em></p>
<p>&lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,&rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, &lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are the things which you should do:</p>
<p>speak the truth to one another;</p>
<p>judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,&rsquo; declares the LORD.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>It will</em> yet <em>be</em> that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. &lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, &ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.&rdquo; '</p>
<p>So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts</p>
<p>in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD of hosts,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, &ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <strong>burden</strong> of the word of the LORD is against</p>
<p>the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it;</p>
<p>Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.</p>
<p>Ashkelon will see <em>it</em> and be afraid.</p>
<p>Gaza too will writhe in great pain;</p>
<p>Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.</p>
<p>And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth.</p>
<p>Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.</p>
<p>But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.</p>
<p>Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout <em>in triumph,</em> O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you;</p>
<p>He is just and endowed with salvation,</p>
<p>Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.</p>
<p>I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem;</p>
<p>And the bow of war will be cut off.</p>
<p>And He will speak peace to the nations;</p>
<p>And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>As for you also, because of the blood of <em>My</em> covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.</p>
<p>Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior&rsquo;s sword.</p>
<p>Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink <em>and</em> be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a <em>sacrificial</em> basin, <em>Drenched</em> like the corners of the altar.</p>
<p>And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For <em>they are as</em> the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty <em>will be</em> theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to <em>each</em> man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore <em>the people</em> wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone,</p>
<p>From them the tent peg,</p>
<p>From them the bow of battle,</p>
<p>From them every ruler, <em>all</em> of them together. &ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down <em>the enemy</em> in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD <em>will be</em> with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if <em>from</em> wine; Indeed, their children will see <em>it</em> and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. &ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. &quot;</p>
<p>When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. &quot;</p>
<p>I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no <em>room</em> can be found for them. &ldquo;And they will pass through the sea <em>of</em> distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. &ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,&rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious <em>trees</em> have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds&rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions&rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, &ldquo;Pasture the flock <em>doomed</em> to slaughter. &ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and <em>each of</em> those who sell them says, &lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And their own shepherds have no pity on them. &ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,&rdquo; declares the LORD; &quot;</p>
<p>but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another&rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver <em>them</em> from their power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I pastured the flock <em>doomed</em> to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.</p>
<p>And I took for myself two staffs:</p>
<p>the one I called Favor and</p>
<p>the other I called Union;</p>
<p>so I pastured the flock.</p>
<p>Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.</p>
<p>Then I said, &ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another&rsquo;s flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces,</p>
<p>to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</p>
<p>So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>I said to them, &ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give <em>me</em> my wages; but if not, never mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they weighed out thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver as my wages.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Throw it to the potter, <em>that</em> magnificent price at which I was valued by them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I took the thirty <em>shekels</em> of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</p>
<p>The LORD said to me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. &ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land</p>
<p>who will not care for the perishing,</p>
<p>seek the scattered,</p>
<p>heal the broken,</p>
<p>or sustain the one standing,</p>
<p>but will devour the flesh of the fat <em>sheep</em> and tear off their hoofs. &quot;</p>
<p>Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock!</p>
<p>A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye!</p>
<p>His arm will be totally withered</p>
<p>And his right eye will be blind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Burden #2</p>
<p>The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</p>
<p><em>Thus</em> declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. &quot;</p>
<p>It will come about <strong>in that day</strong> that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples;</p>
<p>all who lift it will be severely injured.</p>
<p>And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong>,&rdquo; declares the LORD, &ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. &ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, &lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. &ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David <em>will be</em> like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. &quot;</p>
<p>And <strong>in that day</strong> I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. &ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. &ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. &quot;</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. &quot;</p>
<p>It will come about <strong>in that day</strong>,&rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, &ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. &ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, &lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD&rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. &quot;</p>
<p>Also it will come about <strong>in that day</strong> that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, &lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.&rsquo; &ldquo;And one will say to him, &lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?&rsquo; Then he will say, &lsquo;<em>Those</em> with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.&rsquo; &ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,&rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. &ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. &ldquo;It will come about in all the land,&rdquo; Declares the LORD, &ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off <em>and</em> perish; But the third will be left in it. &ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, &lsquo;They are My people,&rsquo; And they will say, &lsquo;The LORD is my God.&rsquo;&rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, <em>and</em> all the holy ones with Him!</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.</p>
<p>And in <strong>that day</strong> living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth;</p>
<p><strong>in that day</strong> the LORD will be <em>the only</em> one, and His name <em>the only</em> one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin&rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king&rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.</p>
<p>It will come about <strong>in that day</strong> that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another&rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no <em>rain will fall</em> on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.</p>
<p><strong>In that day</strong> there will <em>be inscribed</em> on the bells of the horses, &ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.&rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD&rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.</p>
<p>And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts <strong>in that day</strong>.</p>

In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original metanoia (change your mind). We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. </code></a>

This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it first is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be right with God. Israel needed to come to God by faith, not merely saying they did wrong and accepting God's punishment.</code></a></li>
