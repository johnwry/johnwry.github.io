<li>A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows&hellip; — Psalm 68:5</li>
<li>You, LORD, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror. — Psalm 10:17–18</li>
</ul>
<p>God is a father to the fatherless, a defender of the widow. He encourages the afflicted and listens to their cry.</p>
<p>The book of Zechariah contains a powerful message to the reader. One&rsquo;s view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does.</p>
<p>God is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God&rsquo;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances it would appear as though God had forgotten Israel. The prophet Zechariah&rsquo;s message is to show them that God remembers and in His appointed time will return to them in blessing. This offer is always before Israel yet they reject Him over and over. Eventually Israel will be brought through a great Tribulation and only then will the the prophecies of Zechariah be fully accomplished. It will be when God remembers Israel at His appointed time and where the blessings will never fade away again.</p>

<p>A Mighty Fortress is our God (Martin Luther)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow&rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;
<strong>Lord Sabaoth is his name</strong>, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us;
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That word above all earthly pow&rsquo;rs, no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth;
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill: God&rsquo;s truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.</p>

This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today.  The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic.

</h5><p>motivation for doing the fasting was not for God. Neither did God ever tell them it should be done.</p>
<p>Man has not changed much. today during the church age much is not in the name of faith for God but has has not God as a mottive nor His ordination. this can be seen as religios rote but also in more modern churches where people seek to bring &lsquo;social justice&rsquo; remove poverty from the earth, give to multiple causes etc.
just like the fasting in thise days was not for God, today&rsquo;s multiple sanctimonius activities can be godless.</p>

the LORD will defend
the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and the one who is feeble among them
in that day will be like David,
and the house of David <em>will be</em> like God,
like the angel of the LORD before them.
&ldquo;And in that day
I will set about
to destroy all the nations
that come against Jerusalem.
&ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David
and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
the Spirit of grace
and of supplication,
so that they will look on Me
whom they have pierced;
and they will mourn for Him,
as one mourns for an only son,
and they will weep bitterly over Him
like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.
&ldquo;In that day
there will be great mourning
in Jerusalem,
like the mourning of Hadadrimmon
in the plain of Megiddo.
&ldquo;The land will mourn,
every family by itself;
the family of the house of David
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the house of Nathan
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the house of Levi
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
the family of the Shimeites
by itself
and their wives
by themselves;
all the families
that remain,
every family
by itself
and their wives
by themselves.
&ldquo;In that day
a fountain will be opened
for the house of David and
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
for sin and for impurity.
&ldquo;It will come about in that day,&rdquo;
declares the LORD of hosts,
&ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land,
and they will no longer be remembered;
and I will also remove the prophets
and the unclean spirit from the land.
&ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies,
then his father and mother
who gave birth to him
will say to him,
&lsquo;You shall not live,
for you have spoken
falsely in the name of the LORD&rsquo;;
and his father and mother
who gave birth to him
will pierce him through
when he prophesies.
&ldquo;Also it will come about
in that day
that the prophets will each be ashamed
of his vision when he prophesies,
and they will not put on a hairy robe
in order to deceive;
but he will say, &lsquo;I am not a prophet;
I am a tiller of the ground,
for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.&rsquo;
&ldquo;And one will say to him,
&lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?&rsquo;
Then he will say,
&lsquo;<em>Those</em> with which I was wounded
in the house of my friends.&rsquo;</p>
