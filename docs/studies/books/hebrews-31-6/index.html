<blockquote>
<p>Moses was faithful in His house.</p>
<p>A bit of background:</p>
<p><em>Scholars tell us that this Pharaoh had a son, who because he was physically and mentally handicapped, was considered incapable of assuming the royal prerogatives to which he had been born. When he ascended the throne as Thothmes II, his sister Hatshepsut became regent and actually ruled the country. Thothmes II eventually died without a legitimate heir, but because both his father and sister had foreseen this lack of a successor, they probably had determined long beforehand that Moses would be the eventual heir. So from earliest years Moses had been educated with this in mind, as Stephen declares: “Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds” (Acts 7:22).</em></p>
<p><em>When her brother died, it appears that Hatshepsut retained supreme authority as regent in Egypt and indicated her intention of placing Moses, her adopted son, on the throne as her successor. To legitimize this, she had planned to marry Moses to her elder daughter, Nepherus. Moses, however, apparently both refused the throne and the bride, and thus sacrificed his position in the kingdom and the honor and the wealth that went with it.</em></p>

<p><strong>Childhood of Moises:</strong></p>
<p><a href="verseid:44.7.19"><strong>Act 7:19</strong> </a> &ldquo;It was he who took shrewd advantage of our race and mistreated our fathers so that they would expose their infants and they would not survive.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:44.7.20"><strong>Act 7:20</strong> </a> &ldquo;It was at this time that Moses was born; and he was lovely in the sight of God, and he was nurtured three months in his father&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:44.7.21"><strong>Act 7:21</strong> </a> &ldquo;And after he had been set outside, Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter took him away and nurtured him as her own son.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:44.7.22"><strong>Act 7:22</strong> </a> &ldquo;Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and he was a man of power in words and deeds.</p>
<p><strong>Young man:</strong></p>
<p><a href="verseid:58.11.24"><strong>Heb 11:24</strong> </a> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh&rsquo;s daughter,</p>
<p><a href="verseid:58.11.25"><strong>Heb 11:25</strong> </a> choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,</p>
<p><a href="verseid:58.11.26"><strong>Heb 11:26</strong> </a> considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward.</p>
<p><strong>Adult:</strong> Ex 1:8-14</p>
<p><a href="verseid:44.7.23"><strong>Act 7:23-27</strong> </a> &ldquo;But when he was approaching the age of forty, it entered his mind to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel. &ldquo;And when he saw one <em>of them</em> being treated unjustly, he defended him and took vengeance for the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian. &ldquo;And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand.</p>
<p><a href="verseid:58.11.27"><strong>Heb 11:27-29</strong> </a> By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though <em>they were passing</em> through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.</p>
<p>7 verses in hebrews 11 are dedicated to Moses.</p>
<p>Hebrews mentions moses 11 times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>​	For He has been counted worthy</p>
<p>​		of more glory than Moses,</p>
<p>​		by just so much</p>
<p>​		as the builder of the house</p>
<p>​		has more honor than the house.</p>
<p>For every house</p>
<p>is built by someone,</p>
<p>but the builder of all things is God.</p>
<p>Now Moses was faithful in all His house</p>
<p>​	as a servant,</p>
<p>​	for a testimony of those things</p>
<p>​	which were to be spoken later;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.1.45"><strong>Jhn 1:45</strong> </a> Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and <em>also</em> the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.1.46"><strong>Jhn 1:46</strong> </a> Nathanael said to him, &ldquo;Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?&rdquo; Philip *said to him, &ldquo;Come and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.1.47"><strong>Jhn 1:47</strong> </a> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, &ldquo;Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.1.48"><strong>Jhn 1:48</strong> </a> Nathanael *said to Him, &ldquo;How do You know me?&rdquo; Jesus answered and said to him, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.1.49"><strong>Jhn 1:49</strong> </a> Nathanael answered Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="verseid:43.1.17"><strong>Jhn 1:17</strong> </a> For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>but Christ <em>was faithful</em> as a Son</p>
<p>​	over His house—</p>
<p>​	whose house we are,</p>
<p>​		if we hold fast</p>
<p>​			our confidence</p>
<p>​			and the boast</p>
<p>​			of our hope</p>
<p>​			firm until the end.</p>
