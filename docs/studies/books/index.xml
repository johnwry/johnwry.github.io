      <description>What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life— and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us— what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.</description>

      <title>Galatians</title>

      <description>The Book of Galatians# In the world we live in, the Sin Nature rules. It shows its ugly self through &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; - Galatians 5:19-21
How do we deal with these issues in the church?
The compelling argument of the judaizing-missionaries to Galatia was to become jewish proselites. That is, the christian converts needed to become observers of the law.</description>

      <description>Gal 3:21 Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. Gal 3:22 But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. Gal 3:23 But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.</description>

      <description>Heb 3:1 Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;
Heb 3:2 He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.
Heb 3:3 For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.
Heb 3:4 For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.</description>

      <description>In God&amp;rsquo;s Sovereignty, God is always just
Rom 9:1 I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, Rom 9:2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. Rom 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, Rom 9:4 who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, Rom 9:5 whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever.</description>

      <description>Zechariah Return to Me!
A prodigal nation comes home
Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time
Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be&amp;hellip;for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15
We know there are certain books in the Bible that are not as popular as others.</description>
