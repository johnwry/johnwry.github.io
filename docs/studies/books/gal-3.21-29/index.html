        <p>Gal 3:21  Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law.
Gal 3:22  But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
Gal 3:23  But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.
Gal 3:24  Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.
Gal 3:25  But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
Gal 3:26  For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Gal 3:27  For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
Gal 3:28  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Gal 3:29  And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, heirs according to promise.</p>

<p>===
Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God?
May it never be!
For if a law had been given
which was able to impart life,
then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin,
so that the promise
by faith in Jesus Christ
might be given to those
who believe.
But before faith came,
we were kept in custody under the law,
being shut up to the faith
which was later to be revealed.
Therefore the Law has become our tutor
to lead us to Christ,
so that we may be justified by faith.
But now that faith has come,
we are no longer under a tutor.
For you are all sons of God
through faith in Christ Jesus.
For all of you
who were baptized into Christ
have clothed yourselves with Christ.
There is neither Jew nor Greek,
there is neither slave nor free man,
there is neither male nor female;
for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
And if you belong to Christ,
then you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants,
heirs according to promise.</p>
