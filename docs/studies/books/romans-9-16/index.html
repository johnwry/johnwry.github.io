        <p>In God&rsquo;s Sovereignty, God is always just</p>
<p>Rom 9:1  I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,
Rom 9:2  that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
Rom 9:3  For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
Rom 9:4  who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises,
Rom 9:5  whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
Rom 9:6  But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;
Rom 9:7  nor are they all children because they are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, but: &ldquo;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.&rdquo;
Rom 9:8  That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.
Rom 9:9  For this is the word of promise: &ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.&rdquo;
Rom 9:10  And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;
Rom 9:11  for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God&rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
Rom 9:12  it was said to her, &ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.&rdquo;
Rom 9:13  Just as it is written, &ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.&rdquo;
Rom 9:14  What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!
Rom 9:15  For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;
Rom 9:16  So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.
Rom 9:17  For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo;
Rom 9:18  So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
Rom 9:19  You will say to me then, &ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?&rdquo;
Rom 9:20  On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, &ldquo;Why did you make me like this,&rdquo; will it?
Rom 9:21  Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?
Rom 9:22  What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
Rom 9:23  And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,
Rom 9:24  even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.
Rom 9:25  As He says also in Hosea, &ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, &lsquo;MY PEOPLE,&rsquo; AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, &lsquo;BELOVED.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Rom 9:26  &ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, &lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,&rsquo; THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.&rdquo;
Rom 9:27  Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, &ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED;
Rom 9:28  FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.&rdquo;
Rom 9:29  And just as Isaiah foretold, &ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.&rdquo;
Israel&rsquo;s Unbelief</p>
<p>Rom 9:30  What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
Rom 9:31  but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
Rom 9:32  Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
Rom 9:33  just as it is written, &ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;
Rom 10:1  Brethren, my heart&rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.
Rom 10:2  For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
Rom 10:3  For not knowing about God&rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
The Message of Salvation to All</p>
<p>Rom 10:5  For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.
Rom 10:6  But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: &ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, &lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down),
Rom 10:7  or &lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).&rdquo;
Rom 10:8  But what does it say? &ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART&rdquo;—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,
Rom 10:9  that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;
Rom 10:10  for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
Rom 10:11  For the Scripture says, &ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;
Rom 10:12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;
Rom 10:13  for &ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.&rdquo;
Rom 10:14  How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?
Rom 10:15  How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, &ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!&rdquo;
Rom 10:16  However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, &ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?&rdquo;
Rom 10:17  So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
Rom 10:18  But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; &ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.&rdquo;
Rom 10:19  But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, &ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.&rdquo;
Rom 10:20  And Isaiah is very bold and says, &ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.&rdquo;
Rom 10:21  But as for Israel He says, &ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.&rdquo;
Rom 11:1  I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
Rom 11:2  God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
Rom 11:3  &ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.&rdquo;
Rom 11:4  But what is the divine response to him? &ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.&rdquo;
Rom 11:5  In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice.
Rom 11:6  But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
Rom 11:7  What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;
Rom 11:8  just as it is written, &ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&rdquo;
Rom 11:9  And David says, &ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.
Rom 11:10  &ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.&rdquo;
Gentiles Grafted In</p>
<p>Rom 11:11  I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.
Rom 11:12  Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!
Rom 11:13  But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
Rom 11:14  if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
Rom 11:15  For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
Rom 11:16  If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too.
Rom 11:17  But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,
Rom 11:18  do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.
Rom 11:19  You will say then, &ldquo;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.&rdquo;
Rom 11:20  Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;
Rom 11:21  for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either.
Rom 11:22  Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God&rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
Rom 11:23  And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
Rom 11:24  For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?
The Mystery of Israel&rsquo;s Salvation</p>
<p>Rom 11:25  For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;
Rom 11:26  and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, &ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.&rdquo;
Rom 11:27  &ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.&rdquo;
Rom 11:28  From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;
Rom 11:29  for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
Rom 11:30  For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
Rom 11:31  so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.
Rom 11:32  For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.
Rom 11:33  Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!
Rom 11:34  For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?
Rom 11:35  Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?
Rom 11:36  For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.</p>
<p>===</p>
<h1 id="in-gods-sovereignty-god-is-always-just">In God&rsquo;s Sovereignty, God is always just</h1>
<p>I am telling the truth
in Christ,
I am not lying,
my conscience testifies
with me
in the Holy Spirit,
that I have great sorrow
and unceasing grief
in my heart.
For I could wish
that I myself were accursed,
separated from Christ
for the sake of my brethren,
my kinsmen
according to the flesh,
who are Israelites,
to whom belongs
the adoption as sons,
and the glory
and the covenants
and the giving of the Law
and the temple service
and the promises,
whose are the fathers,
and from whom is the Christ
according to the flesh,
who is over all,
God blessed forever.
Amen.
But
it is not as though the word of God has failed.
For they are not all Israel
who are descended
from Israel;
nor are they all children
because they are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants,
but:
&ldquo;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.&rdquo;
That is,
it is not the children of the flesh
who are children
of God,
but
the children
of the promise
are regarded as descendants.
For this is the word of promise:
&ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME,
AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.&rdquo;
And not only this,
but there was Rebekah also,
when she had conceived twins
by one man,
our father Isaac;
for though the twins
were not yet born
and had not done anything
good or bad,
so that God&rsquo;s purpose
according to His choice would stand,
not because of works
but because of Him
who calls,
it was said to her,
&ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.&rdquo;
Just as it is written,
&ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.&rdquo;
What shall we say then?
There is no injustice with God, is there?
May it never be!
For He says to Moses,
&ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY
ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY,
AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION
ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;
So then it does not depend on the man
who wills <code>Esau willed</code>
or the man
who runs, <code>Jacob ran</code>
but on God
who has mercy. <code>God is merciful</code>
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh,
&ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP,
TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU,
AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo;
So then He has mercy
on whom He desires,
and He hardens
whom He desires.
You will say to me then,
&ldquo;Why does He still find fault?
For who resists His will?&rdquo;
On the contrary,
who are you,
O man,
who answers back to God?
The thing molded
will not say to the molder,
&ldquo;Why did you make me like this,&rdquo;
will it?
Or does not the potter have a right
over the clay,
to make from the same lump
one vessel for honorable use
and another for common use?
What if God,
although willing to demonstrate His wrath
and to make His power known,
endured with much patience
vessels of wrath
prepared for destruction?
And He did so
to make known
the riches of His glory
upon vessels of mercy,
which He prepared beforehand
for glory,
even us,
whom He also called,
not from among Jews only,
but also from among Gentiles.
As He says also in Hosea,
&ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE
WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE,
&lsquo;MY PEOPLE,&rsquo;
AND HER
WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, &lsquo;BELOVED.&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE
WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM,
&lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,&rsquo;
THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS
OF THE LIVING GOD.&rdquo;
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,
&ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER
OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL
BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA,
IT IS THE REMNANT
THAT WILL BE SAVED;
FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE
HIS WORD ON THE EARTH,
THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.&rdquo;
And just as Isaiah foretold,
&ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD
OF SABAOTH
HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY,
WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM,
AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.&rdquo;
What shall we say then?
That Gentiles,
who did not pursue righteousness,
attained righteousness,
even the righteousness
which is by faith;
but Israel,
pursuing a law of righteousness,
did not arrive at that law.
Why?
Because they did not pursue it by faith,
but as though it were by works.
They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
just as it is written,
&ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION
A STONE OF STUMBLING
AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE,
AND HE WHO BELIEVES
IN HIM
WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;
Brethren, my heart&rsquo;s desire
and my prayer
to God
for them
is for their salvation.
For I testify about them
that they have a zeal
for God,
but not in accordance with knowledge.
For not knowing about God&rsquo;s righteousness
and seeking to establish their own,
they did not subject themselves
to the righteousness of God.
For Christ is the end of the law
for righteousness
to everyone
who believes.
For Moses writes
that the man
who practices the righteousness
which is based on law
shall live by that righteousness.
But the righteousness based on faith speaks
as follows:
&ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART,
&lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?&rsquo;
(that is, to bring Christ down),
or &lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?&rsquo;
(that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).&rdquo;
But what does it say?
&ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU,
IN YOUR MOUTH
AND IN YOUR HEART&rdquo;—
that is, the word of faith
which we are preaching,
that if you confess
with your mouth Jesus as Lord,
and believe in your heart
that God raised Him
from the dead,
you will be saved;
for with the heart a person believes,
resulting in righteousness,
and with the mouth he confesses,
resulting in salvation.
For the Scripture says,
&ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES
IN HIM
WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;
For there is no distinction
between Jew and Greek;
for the same Lord is Lord
of all,
abounding in riches
for all who call on Him;
for &ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL
ON THE NAME
OF THE LORD
WILL BE SAVED.&rdquo;
How then will they call
on Him
in whom they have not believed?
How will they believe
in Him
whom they have not heard?
And how will they hear
without a preacher?
How will they preach unless they are sent?
Just as it is written,
&ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET
OF THOSE
WHO BRING GOOD NEWS
OF GOOD THINGS!&rdquo;
However, they did not all heed the good news;
for Isaiah says,
&ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?&rdquo;
So faith comes
from hearing,
and hearing
by the word of Christ.
But I say, surely they have never heard, have they?
Indeed they have;
&ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT
INTO ALL THE EARTH,
AND THEIR WORDS
TO THE ENDS
OF THE WORLD.&rdquo;
But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they?
First Moses says,
&ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT
WHICH IS NOT A NATION,
BY A NATION
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.&rdquo;
And Isaiah is very bold and says,
&ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE
WHO DID NOT SEEK ME,
I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE
WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.&rdquo;
But as for Israel He says,
&ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG
I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS
TO A DISOBEDIENT
AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.&rdquo;
I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He?
May it never be!
For I too am an Israelite,
a descendant of Abraham,
of the tribe of Benjamin.
God has not rejected His people
whom He foreknew.
Or do you not know
what the Scripture says
in the passage about Elijah,
how he pleads with God against Israel?
&ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS,
THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS,
AND I ALONE AM LEFT,
AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.&rdquo;
But what is the divine response to him?
&ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN
WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.&rdquo;
In the same way then,
there has also come to be
at the present time
a remnant
according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice.
But if it is by grace,
it is no longer on the basis of works,
otherwise grace is no longer grace.
What then? What Israel is seeking,
it has not obtained,
but those
who were chosen obtained it,
and the rest were hardened;
just as it is written,
&ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR,
EYES TO SEE NOT
AND EARS TO HEAR NOT,
DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&rdquo;
And David says,
&ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE
BECOME A SNARE
AND A TRAP,
AND A STUMBLING BLOCK
AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.
&ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED
TO SEE NOT,
AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.&rdquo;
I say then,
they did not stumble so as to fall, did they?
May it never be!
But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles,
to make them jealous.
Now if their transgression is riches
for the world
and their failure is riches
for the Gentiles,
how much more will their fulfillment be!
But I am speaking to you
who are Gentiles.
Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles,
I magnify my ministry,
if somehow I might move
to jealousy my fellow countrymen
and save some of them.
For if their rejection is the reconciliation
of the world,
what will their acceptance be
but life from the dead?
If the first piece of dough is holy,
the lump is also;
and if the root is holy,
the branches are too.
But if some of the branches were broken off,
and you,
being a wild olive,
were grafted in among them
and became partaker with them
of the rich root of the olive tree,
do not be arrogant toward the branches;
but if you are arrogant,
remember that it is not you
who supports the root,
but the root supports you.
You will say then,
&ldquo;Branches were broken off
so that I might be grafted in.&rdquo;
Quite right, they were broken off
for their unbelief,
but you stand by your faith.
Do not be conceited,
but fear;
for if God did not spare the natural branches,
He will not spare you, either.
Behold then the kindness
and severity of God;
to those
who fell, severity,
but to you, God&rsquo;s kindness,
if you continue in His kindness;
otherwise you also will be cut off.
And they also,
if they do not continue in their unbelief,
will be grafted in,
for God is able to graft them in again.
For if you were cut off
from what is by nature a wild olive tree,
and were grafted
contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree,
how much more will these
who are the natural branches
be grafted into their own olive tree?
For I do not want you, brethren,
to be uninformed of this mystery—
so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—
that a partial hardening has happened to Israel
until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;
and so all Israel will be saved;
just as it is written,
&ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION,
HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.&rdquo;
&ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM,
WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.&rdquo;
From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies
for your sake,
but from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s choice
they are beloved
for the sake of the fathers;
for the gifts
and the calling of God
are irrevocable.
For just as you once were disobedient to God,
but now have been shown mercy
because of their disobedience,
so these also now have been disobedient,
that because of the mercy shown
to you they also may now be shown mercy.
For God has shut up all in disobedience
so that He may show mercy to all.
Oh, the depth of the riches both
of the wisdom
and knowledge of God!
How unsearchable are His judgments
and unfathomable His ways!
For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD,
OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?
Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM
THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?
For from Him
and through Him
and to Him are all things.
To Him be the glory forever. Amen.</p>

<p>1  I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit,
2  that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
3  For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,
4  who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises,
5  whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen.
6  But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel;
7  nor are they all children because they are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, but: &ldquo;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.&rdquo;
8  That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants.
9  For this is the word of promise: &ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.&rdquo;
10  And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;
11  for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God&rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls,
12  it was said to her, &ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.&rdquo;
13  Just as it is written, &ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.&rdquo;
14  What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!
15  For He says to Moses, &ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.&rdquo;
16  So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy.
17  For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, &ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.&rdquo;
18  So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires.
19  You will say to me then, &ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?&rdquo;
20  On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, &ldquo;Why did you make me like this,&rdquo; will it?
21  Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?
22  What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
23  And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory,
24  even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.
25  As He says also in Hosea, &ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, &lsquo;MY PEOPLE,&rsquo; AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, &lsquo;BELOVED.&rsquo;&rdquo;
26  &ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, &lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,&rsquo; THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.&rdquo;
27  Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, &ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED;
28  FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.&rdquo;
29  And just as Isaiah foretold, &ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.&rdquo;
30  What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith;
31  but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
32  Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,
33  just as it is written, &ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="10">10</h3>
<p>1  Brethren, my heart&rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation.
2  For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
3  For not knowing about God&rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
5  For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness.
6  But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: &ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, &lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down),
7  or &lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?&rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).&rdquo;
8  But what does it say? &ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART&rdquo;—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,
9  that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;
10  for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.
11  For the Scripture says, &ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.&rdquo;
12  For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him;
13  for &ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.&rdquo;
14  How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?
15  How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, &ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!&rdquo;
16  However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, &ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?&rdquo;
17  So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.
18  But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; &ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.&rdquo;
19  But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, &ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.&rdquo;
20  And Isaiah is very bold and says, &ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.&rdquo;
21  But as for Israel He says, &ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="11">11</h3>
<p>1  I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
2  God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?
3  &ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.&rdquo;
4  But what is the divine response to him? &ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.&rdquo;
5  In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God&rsquo;s gracious choice.
6  But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace.
7  What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;
8  just as it is written, &ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.&rdquo;
9  And David says, &ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM.
10  &ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.&rdquo;
11  I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.
12  Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!
13  But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,
14  if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.
15  For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
16  If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too.
17  But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,
18  do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.
19  You will say then, &ldquo;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.&rdquo;
20  Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;
21  for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either.
22  Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God&rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.
23  And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
24  For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree?
25  For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;
26  and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, &ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.&rdquo;
27  &ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.&rdquo;
28  From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God&rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;
29  for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
30  For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,
31  so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.
32  For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all.
33  Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!
34  For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR?
35  Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN?
36  For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.</p>
