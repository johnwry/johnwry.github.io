        <p>Joh 11:35  Jesus wept.
Joh 11:36  So the Jews were saying, &ldquo;See how He loved him!&rdquo;
Joh 11:37  But some of them said, &ldquo;Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?&rdquo;
Jesus Raises Lazarus</p>
<p>Joh 11:38  So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
Joh 11:39  Jesus *said, &ldquo;Remove the stone.&rdquo; Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.&rdquo;
Joh 11:40  Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?&rdquo;
Joh 11:41  So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
Joh 11:42  &ldquo;I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.&rdquo;
Joh 11:43  When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lazarus, come forth.&rdquo;
Joh 11:44  The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, &ldquo;Unbind him, and let him go.&rdquo;
The Plot to Kill Jesus</p>
<p>Joh 11:45  Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.
Joh 11:46  But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.
Joh 11:47  Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, &ldquo;What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.
Joh 11:48  &ldquo;If we let Him go on like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.&rdquo;</p>

Jesus wept.</p>
<p>​			So the Jews were saying,</p>
<p>​				&ldquo;See how He loved him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>​				But some of them said,</p>
<p>​			&ldquo;Could not this man,</p>
<p>who opened the eyes of the blind man,</p>
<p>have kept this man also from dying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jesus,</p>
<p>again being deeply moved within,</p>
<p>*came to the tomb.</p>
<p>Now it was a cave,</p>
