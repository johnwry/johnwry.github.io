<p>21  When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me.&rdquo;
22  The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking.
23  There was reclining on Jesus&rsquo; bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.
24  So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, &ldquo;Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.&rdquo;

28  Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.
29  For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, &ldquo;Buy the things we have need of for the feast&rdquo;; or else, that he should give something to the poor.
30  So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.
31  Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, &ldquo;Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;
32  if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.
33  &ldquo;Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come.&rsquo;
34  &ldquo;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
35  &ldquo;By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.&rdquo;
36  Simon Peter *said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, where are You going?&rdquo; Jesus answered, &ldquo;Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later.&rdquo;
37  Peter *said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You.&rdquo;

<p>===</p>
<p>When Jesus had said this,
He became troubled in spirit, <code>troubled:TARASO </code>
and testified and said,
&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you,
that one of you will betray Me.&rdquo; <code>betray:to deliver up </code>
The disciples began looking at one another,
at a loss to know
of which one He was speaking.
There was reclining
on Jesus&rsquo; bosom</p>
<p>​	one of His disciples,
​			whom Jesus loved.
​	So Simon Peter
​	gestured to him,
​	and said to him,
​	&ldquo;Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.&rdquo;
He, (that is&hellip;John)
​	leaning back thus on Jesus&rsquo; bosom,
​	said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, who is it?&rdquo;
Jesus then answered,
&ldquo;That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him.&rdquo;
So when He had dipped the morsel,
He took and gave it to Judas,
​					the son of Simon Iscariot.
After the morsel,
Satan then entered into him.
Therefore Jesus said to him,
&ldquo;What you do, do quickly.&rdquo;
Now no one</p>
<p>​		of those reclining at the table</p>
<p>knew for what purpose He had said this to him.
For some were supposing,
because Judas had the money box,
that Jesus was saying to him,
&ldquo;Buy the things we have need of for the feast&rdquo;;
or else, that he should give something to the poor.
So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately;
and it was night.
Therefore when he had gone out,
Jesus said,
&ldquo;Now is the Son of Man glorified,
and God is glorified in Him;
if God is glorified in Him,
God will also glorify Him in Himself,
and will glorify Him immediately.
&ldquo;Little children,
I am with you a little while longer.
You will seek Me;
and as I said to the Jews,
now I also say to you,
&lsquo;Where I am going,
you cannot come.&rsquo;
&ldquo;A new commandment I give to you,
that you love one another,
even as I have loved you,
that you also love one another.
&ldquo;By this all men will know
that you are My disciples,
if you have love for one another.&rdquo;
Simon Peter said to Him,
&ldquo;Lord, where are You going?&rdquo;
Jesus answered,
&ldquo;Where I go, you cannot follow Me now;
but you will follow later.&rdquo;
Peter said to Him,
&ldquo;Lord, why can I not follow You right now?
I will lay down my life for You.&rdquo;
Jesus answered,
&ldquo;Will you lay down your life for Me?
Truly, truly, I say to you,
a rooster will not crow
until you deny Me three times.</p>
