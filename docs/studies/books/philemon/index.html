<p><strong>Greeting</strong></p>
<p>Phm 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved <em>brother</em> and fellow worker,</p>
<p>Phm 1:2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p>Phm 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Philemon&rsquo;s Love and Faith</strong></p>
<p>Phm 1:4 I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</p>
<p>Phm 1:5 because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;</p>
<p>Phm 1:6 <em>and I pray</em> that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Phm 1:7 For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p>
<p><strong>Paul&rsquo;s Plea for Onesimus</strong></p>
<p>Phm 1:8 Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you <em>to do</em> what is proper,</p>
<p>Phm 1:9 yet for love&rsquo;s sake I rather appeal <em>to you</em>—since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—</p>
<p>Phm 1:10 I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,</p>
<p>Phm 1:11 who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.</p>
<p>Phm 1:12 I have sent him back to you in person, that is, <em>sending</em> my very heart,</p>
<p>Phm 1:13 whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;</p>
<p>Phm 1:14 but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.</p>
<p>Phm 1:15 For perhaps he was for this reason separated <em>from you</em> for a while, that you would have him back forever,</p>
<p>Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p>Phm 1:17 If then you regard me a partner, accept him as <em>you would</em> me.</p>
<p>Phm 1:18 But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;</p>
<p>Phm 1:19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).</p>
<p>Phm 1:20 Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p>Phm 1:21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.</p>
<p>Phm 1:22 At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.</p>
<p>**Final Greetings</p>
<p>Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</p>
<p>Phm 1:24 <em>as do</em> Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
<p>Phm 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>

<p><em>Paul,</em></p>

<p><em>and Timothy</em></p>
<p>​	<em>our brother,</em> Timothy wasn&rsquo;t only Paul&rsquo;s brother, he is also Philemon&rsquo;s brother.</p>
<p><em>To Philemon</em> By looking at the pronoun use in the letter, we can see the letter is written to Philemon although inclusion is made to the church that met in Philemon&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>​	<em>from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</em>  Grace and peace are not something Paul wishes them from himself but rather the grace and peace that come from God and the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>Philemon 1: <em>whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>who formerly was useless to you,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>but now is useful both to you and to me.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>I have sent him back to you in person,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>that is, sending my very heart,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>whom I wished to keep with me,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>so that on your behalf</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>he might minister to me in my imprisonment</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>for the gospel;</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>but without your consent I did not want to do anything,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>so that your goodness would not be, in effect,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>by compulsion but of your own free will.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>For perhaps he was for this reason separated from you</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>for a while, that you would have him back forever,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>no longer as a slave,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>but more than a slave,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>a beloved brother,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>especially to me, but how much more to you,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>both in the flesh and in the Lord.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>If then you regard me a partner,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>accept him as you would me.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>charge that to my account;</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord;</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>refresh my heart in Christ.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>Having confidence in your obedience,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>I write to you,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>since I know that you will do even more than what I say.</em></p>
<h1 id="philemon-122-25-farewell">Philemon 1:22-25 Farewell</h1>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>At the same time also prepare me a lodging,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke,</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>my fellow workers.</em></p>
<p>Philemon 1: <em>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</em></p>
