Philemon\u0026rsquo;s Love and Faith Phm 1:4 Doy gracias a mi Dios siempre, haciendo mención de ti en mis oraciones, Phm 1:5 porque oigo de tu amor y de la fe que tienes hacia el Señor Jesús y hacia todos los santos. Phm 1:6 Ruego que la comunión de tu fe llegue a ser eficaz por el conocimiento de todo lo bueno que hay en ustedes mediante Cristo. Phm 1:7 Pues he llegado a tener mucho gozo y consuelo en tu amor, porque los corazones de los santos han sido confortados por ti, hermano. Paul\u0026rsquo;s Plea for Onesimus Phm 1:8 Por lo cual, aunque tengo mucha libertad en Cristo para mandarte hacer lo que conviene, Phm 1:9 no obstante, por causa del amor que te tengo, te hago un ruego, siendo como soy, Pablo, anciano, y ahora también prisionero de Cristo Jesús: Phm 1:10 te ruego por mi hijo Onésimo, a quien he engendrado en mis prisiones; Phm 1:11 quien en otro tiempo te era inútil, pero ahora nos es útil a ti y a mí. Phm 1:12 Y te lo he vuelto a enviar en persona, es decir, como si fuera mi propio corazón. Phm 1:13 Hubiera querido retenerlo conmigo, para que me sirviera en lugar tuyo en mis prisiones por el evangelio. Phm 1:14 Pero no quise hacer nada sin tu consentimiento, para que tu bondad no fuera como por obligación, sino por tu propia voluntad. Phm 1:15 Porque quizá por esto se apartó de ti por algún tiempo, para que lo volvieras a recibir para siempre, Phm 1:16 ya no como esclavo, sino como más que un esclavo, como un hermano amado, especialmente para mí, pero cuánto más para ti, tanto en la carne como en el Señor. Phm 1:17 Si me tienes, pues, por compañero, acéptalo como me aceptarías a mí. Phm 1:18 Y si te ha perjudicado en alguna forma, o te debe algo, cárgalo a mi cuenta. Phm 1:19 Yo, Pablo, escribo esto con mi propia mano. Yo lo pagaré (por no decirte que aun tú mismo te me debes a mí). Phm 1:20 Sí, hermano, permíteme disfrutar este beneficio de ti en el Señor. Recrea mi corazón en Cristo. Phm 1:21 Te escribo confiado en tu obediencia, sabiendo que harás aún más de lo que digo. Phm 1:22 Y al mismo tiempo, prepárame también alojamiento, pues espero que por las oraciones de ustedes les seré concedido. Final Greetings Phm 1:23 Te saluda Epafras, mi compañero de prisión en Cristo Jesús; Phm 1:24 también Marcos, Aristarco, Demas y Lucas, mis colaboradores. Phm 1:25 La gracia del Señor Jesucristo sea con el espíritu de ustedes.\n"},{

      "content":"A. Introduction\nprayers for the Weir family at this time.\nWith biblical illiteracy at an all-time high in our western world, I believe there is a great need for teaching Scripture at a worldview level.\nKnowing God, and understanding His ways, inevitably changes our thinking and leads us to a correct worldview. Why is this level of understanding important? Because our worldview determines our values which in turn will determine our beliefs which in turn determines our actions. It\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate that a lot of teaching today is focused merely on a change of behavior. This is an incorrect approach to how God has shown us in His word. My desire this morning is to reveal certain instances where God clearly stepped into time and space to reveal himself, his character, so that man could know who He really was. Knowing God is the basis for a correct worldview. A Relational God# When the Godhead gathered together to discuss the creation of man, they said, \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s make a being who is like us, one who is relational and can communicate feelings, respond to input, gather information, reason etc.\u0026rdquo;. We find God\u0026rsquo;s exact words in Genesis 1 \u0026ldquo;Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness\u0026rdquo;. The fellowship of the Godhead desired to have a relationship with this particular created being. God and man were friends in the beginning just the way God intended.\nWe all know the story of the fall of man and what resulted, yet God\u0026rsquo;s intent never changed. He, being relational, wanted a relationship with his created beings.\nGod has always wanted to be in a relationship with mankind yet now there\u0026rsquo;s an impassable barrier because of sin. Genesis 8:21 says, \u0026ldquo;the intent of man\u0026rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth;\u0026rdquo; Man does not desire God. Man does not look for God. Man has fallen short of the glory of God.\nYet God continues to be deeply desirous of a relationship with man. Throughout time he has incessantly been revealing his true self to man. He has given visible displays of his attributes through Scripture so we too can learn who He truly is.\nGod is perfect. He is perfect in all His ways because He is perfect. He is perfectly just and loving all at the very same time. Often throughout Scripture, He reveals his holiness and his grace all at once.\nFor instance: Nothing highlights all of God\u0026rsquo;s attributes at once in the OT better than the account of God giving Moses the Ten Commandments followed by His instructions to build the tabernacle. Ex 25:1-9\nImmediately upon giving Israel the Law, God knew she would fail to keep it. Yet God provided them a way for their failures and sins to be covered until the promised Deliverer would come and remove them altogether. God\u0026rsquo;s justice in the giving of the law is revealed, God\u0026rsquo;s mercy is shown in the tabernacle in how He will dwell with his people. This is not uncommon. There are other events that clearly show all of these attributes of God at the same time as well\u0026hellip;for instance\u0026hellip; Immediately upon God judging Adam and Eve, He gave them the first promise of the coming Deliverer. With Noah and the flood, for 120 years we see God reaching out toward mankind in love and patience. He provided a witness in the form of prophets like Enoch and Noah, the preacher of righteousness. He left the door for salvation open right to the very end. With the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah Abraham asked God if He would destroy the righteous with the unrighteous. Of course, God would never do that. God removed righteous Lot before the first hailstone fell. Now with the giving of the Law and the immediate provision of a tabernacle God who is just, once again proved His love in the face of human failure. God’s grace was once again on full display. B. The Big Picture\nSo, here’s the picture: We have a sinful human race, symbolized by the nation of Israel, and a completely holy, righteous, and almighty Creator God of the universe. These two are separated by the sinfulness of the people. Therefore, God had Moses build the tabernacle, the place where He would dwell with His chosen people, Israel. The glory of God dwelled inside the holy of holies, inside the tabernacle located in the middle of Israel’s camp. Though He lived among them, still, because they were sinful, His presence was separated by a thick curtain. Jesus and the Curtain (Matt 27:45-51)# We come to the NT. The greatest example of all of God revealing himself is in Jesus and specifically on the cross. God is once again revealing he is JUST through the punishment and chastisement of the Lord Jesus. When Christ took upon himself the sins of the World, God\u0026rsquo;s justice was seen when He turned his back on own His son due to our sin. Yet, at the very same time God showed He is merciful, ripping in half the curtain of the temple from top to bottom, symbolically showing us that direct access to the Father was now provided through the person and work of Jesus Christ. God was lovingly showing there was a new and better way and that the foreshadow of the tabernacle/temple was now a reality in Christ.\nHeb 10:19-20\nIn fact, we are invited to come bodly to the throne of Grace.\nHeb 4:16 Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\nConclusion# God is always about relationships. He loves us so much that He wants us to be able to enjoy closeness and communion with Him. As people we tend to only turn to Him in trust and dependence when we feel desperate. God capitalizes on this tendancy. Romans 5:20a – The law came in so that the trespass would increase.\nPaul stated that the law was given to show us how far we fall from God’s perfect standard. All humans are sinful by means of their sin nature. The law is designed to expose to us our sin lest we deceive ourselves.\nC. H. Mackintosh on the law: “It was in a certain sense, like a perfect mirror let down from heaven to reveal to man his moral derangement. If I present myself with derangement habit before a mirror, it shows the derangement, but does not set it right. If I measure a crooked wall with a perfect plumb-line, it reveals the crookedness, but does not remove it. If I take out a lamp on a dark night, it reveals to me all the hindrances and disagreeables in the way, but it does not remove them. Moreover, the mirror, the plumb-line, and the lamp do not create the evils which they clearly point out. They neither create nor remove, but simply reveal. Thus it is with the law. It does not create the evil in man’s heart, neither does it remove it, but with unerring accuracy, it reveals it.”\nIn a similar manner, God uses the law as a tool to show us our sin sickness. But the law cannot take away our sins or make us righteous. Romans 7:13\nRom 7:13 Therefore did that which is good become a cause of death for me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be shown to be sin by effecting my death through that which is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful.\nThis leads us to one of our main problems in the church today. The New Testament is full of biblical instruction that contains many imperatives. In fact, the commands of the New Testament often hold believers to an even higher standard than the Ten Commandments do. This shows us God\u0026rsquo;s justice, righteousness and holiness. God is perfectly just.\nAll God’s commands are good. God wants us to keep His instructions. But in the same way the Old Testament law did not provide the Israelites with the power to keep God’s commands, yet they do not provide the believer with the necessary power to fulfill God’s will.\nIf we view our relationship with God by our ability to obey God’s instructions, then we too will have the same fearful response towards God that Israel had. They stood at a distance of God\u0026rsquo;s presence. They trembled.\nHowever, God used the Old Testament Law to help Israel recognize their sinfulness and realize their need for trusting in the coming promised Deliverer. In a similar manner, our inability as believers to obey New Testament commands and instructions should point us to Christ and our need to depend on Him for the power to obey. Christ is God\u0026rsquo;s provision of mercy and grace in the life of the believer.\nJust as Peter’s self-proclaimed commitment and devotion to Christ (“Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You! Mk. 14:31),” left him weeping bitterly (Matt. 26:75), so our own failure and inability to keep God’s instructions often leaves us very discouraged and disappointed in ourselves.\nNot until we fully understand our total inability to please God through our own efforts will our hearts be prepared to accept and appropriate the gospel by faith. The gospel of our salvation is Christ’s substitutionary death for our sins and subsequent resurrection on the third day. Based on the gospel we have sanctification in our co-crucifixion and co-resurrection with Him. In our identification with Christ the power of sin over our lives was broken. God’s grace and human effort do not blend. We cannot walk in a relation with a perfect God through a means he has not revealed. Romans 11:6 God is perfect. He has revealed he is perfectly just through the law and especially on the cross. Yet God is perfect love and grace. He has made it clear he has made a provision for man\u0026rsquo;s failure. Just like God manifested he wanted to dwell among the people in the tabernacle, he has revealed to us the way. Jesus said, I am that way to a restored friendship with the father. This is the way God has provided for man and it is at the expense of his own Son. God wants to be known by each of us. He has gone to great lengths to display his attributes in so many ways. It\u0026rsquo;s up to us to know God, as he truly is. This is our worldview core. It will lead us to having correct values, beliefs and only this will result in true conduct. Not the other way around. Heb 10:19-25\n"},{

      "content":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/what-is-the-church-according-to-the-bible.html What Is the Church? It\u0026rsquo;s Role and Purpose According to the Bible Pastor Luis Ángel Díaz-Pabón October 22, 2019\nWhat Is the Church?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Role and Purpose According to the Bible “Church” is the translation of the Greek term ekklesia, and is used in the New Testament to identify the community of believers in Jesus Christ. It literally means “assembly,” “congregation,” or “meeting.” A similar term was used in the Old Testament referring to experiences such as “the day of the assembly,” “the Lord’s congregation,” or “meeting before the Lord.”\nThus, when Jesus declares: “I will build my church” (Mt 16:18), it did not come as something unfamiliar to the common listener. Shortly after, in the New Testament, the word is confined strictly to refer to the congregation of believers in Jesus Christ.\nIt is worth mentioning that in the New Testament, no synagogue, temple, chapel, tabernacle, building or any other meeting place was ever called a “church.” The term always referred to the Christian assembly and, in the New Testament, it was used for both the local community of believers and the overall collection of Christians.\nLocal vs Universal\nThe first sense for which the word “church” is used, what we call “local,” is defined by its geographical setting. The churches in the New Testament were identified by the name of a city, never by the name of a country or region. For example, one would speak of “the churches of Galatia” in plural because Galatia was a region with many cities, and therefore, many local churches. When talking about Corinth, Ephesus, Thessalonica, etc., the singular form is used and the name of the city identifies the church. For example, the church in Corinth or the church in Ephesus; each one of these churches was comprised of the Christian residents of the same city.\nThe second sense, called “universal,” refers to the collection of believers in Jesus Christ from all times and places. This church consists of both Jews and Gentiles. The first meeting of the universal church will occur during the rapture: “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel’s voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord” (1Th 4:16-17). This will be an unprecedented event. All that we have believed and loved, seeing only from a distance, will be a tangible reality. Until then, we rely on the local expression in order to experience communion. This is our immediate family in the faith. The local church differs only in size from the universal, but not in essence. The nature of the local church and God’s commitment to it are the same as those of the universal church.\nWho builds the church?\nJesus declared that building or edifying the church is something He would do personally. He said: “I will build my church” (Mt 16:18), but that does not mean that He will not also use others for the task. One of the most well-known metaphors used to refer to the church is the “body of Christ.” Jesus Christ states that He is the head, and that all believers form His body. The emphasis of the metaphor is on the union of Christ and the church and between the believers themselves—some- thing indispensable to the understanding of how the church functions under the authority of Jesus Christ.\nAccording to Paul, every believer has a function in the church, just as the different parts of a body have a specific function. The idea of a group of clergy taking responsibility for all Christian ministry while a mass of laypeople simply receive the benefits is totally foreign to Scripture. Bishops, elders, pastors, deacons, and new believers are simply members of the body of Christ with distinct responsibilities and roles, according to the maturity and gifts of each one. A believer that behaves like Diotrephes in 3 John (who takes ownership of the local church, believing himself to be the maximum authority) usurps the place of Christ.\nWhat is the role of the local church?\nTherefore, the ministerial responsibility of the local church falls upon the members as a whole. As the members identify their gifts and take on the responsibility of administering them under the leading of the Holy Spirit, the church increases its capacity to bless and to fulfill its mission on earth.\nSome have identified the condition of the modern church as the “80/20 syndrome”: a small percentage of the members (20 percent) take on the responsibility of ministerial work, while the other 80 percent are mere spectators.\nOthers have pointed out that with each passing day, the church is more and more like a football game where, from the stands, a crowd observes a small number of players who offer a great show. Those that put forth an effort on the field urgently need rest, whereas the spectators desperately need to exercise. This image illustrates the reality of the church. The crowd of believers that fills our temples and chapels each Sunday must discover how useful and necessary they are in the divine plan of evangelization and the building of the body of Christ.\nWhat was the church like in the New Testament?\nThe church that we see in the New Testament is dynamic. Never a prisoner of buildings, we see the church meeting in the temple, in a synagogue, in the street, beside the sea, in public places, and often in homes. Acts describes a community of faith in constant movement:\n“Every day they devoted them- selves to meeting together in the temple, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved” (Ac 2:46-47).\nIt appears that the meetings were daily, and definitely not monotonous. Worship, fraternal communion, prayer, working in mutual edification, giving testimony of Christ, and taking care of the needs of the poor were not part of special programs, but rather everyday activities. Those that observed the believers’ way of life called them people of “the Way”—surely due to their constant action, their defined doctrine, and because they could always be seen going from one place to another.\nWhat is the future of the church?\nThe future of the Lord’s church is a glorious one. The church will not only be victorious in heaven, but here on earth as well. By taking another look at Matthew 16:18, we see that it refers to the church when it says “and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.” Jesus’s statement here does not present a small and fearful group of timid believers. On the contrary, it shows a vigorous and bold church, capable of coming out victorious in any circumstance, including death.\nWhen Jesus presents the church as triumphant, even against the gates of Hades, we should see Satan and all his demons defeated by the work of the cross, and representing no threat for the future of the church. Those that form part of the church belong to the winning team and should speak and act as such.\nThe future of the church was established on the mission statement in Matthew 28:19: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations . . .” The verse does not invite us to make disciples “in” the nations but “of” the nations. The church must disciple the nations. As it advances, it teaches the nations how to live. The church carries out the work of discipleship just by existing in the world. Of course, this places an enormous weight of responsibility on the shoulders of every believer, as it assumes that their lives are to be an example and inspiration to humanity.\nIn Ephesians 5:26-27, Paul declares that Jesus gave Himself up for the church, “to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word. He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless.” Our God has not failed in any of His endeavors, nor will He fail in this one. The church was designed to be holy and blameless. With this goal Christ gave Himself up, and with this goal His workers are to carry out their work. There is no reason to believe that we will not achieve this goal. We can affirm that the future of the church will be glorious.\nWhat does God say about the present church?\nWhen we say that the future of the church is glorious, we affirm that the same is true in the present. Today, the church is exactly what God stated: the house of God, the pillar and foundation of the truth, God’s temple, His body, a chosen people, a holy priesthood and, regardless of the circumstances that it faces, it will continue being everything that God said it is.\nIn Ephesians 3:10, Paul explains what is currently happening with the church, “so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.” We cannot fully understand the greatness of the church. For centuries, God kept hidden this marvelous mystery. That which was revealed to Paul and others is so extraordinary that even the angels watch what is taking place attentively. The love of the Lord for His church leaves everyone speechless. God desired to bring Jews and Gentiles together into one people: the church. This is not easy for those who expect everyone to unite under the Jews in order to come to God. Jesus Christ came to earth and gave up His life to save us.\nThis must be admirable to the angels, who saw a good portion of their own fall with no possibility for redemption. Since the Old Testament, the angels have shown curiosity towards this reality, but only recently, and through the church, has God instructed everyone and His wisdom been fully expressed. This scene seems to describe the angels that watch the expression of divine love towards the church from a celestial balcony and, in admiration, are able to understand the wisdom of God like never before. This knowledge should leave us breathless, with tears of thankfulness and a profound sensation of admiration and humility as we see ourselves as a privileged part of the divine plan. Glory to God in the church today and for all of eternity!\n"},{

These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete. This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; practice: but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, many times I believe God is angry for my sin and has turned His back on me. Yet this is not true. Jesus himself is my advocate and he Himself is the propitiation before God for my sins. Through Jesus, God can be for us even when we are guilty sinners. we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; Jesus was righteous, He still continues to be righteous and His righteousness is His credential for being my Advocate. Zechariah 3:1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. Zechariah 3:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire? Zechariah 3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. Zechariah 3:4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. Zechariah 3:5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by. A human defense lawyer argues for the innocence of his client. But our Advocate, Jesus Christ, admits our guilt – and then enters His plea on our behalf, as the one who has made an atoning sacrifice for our sinful guilt. and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world. By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. The one who says, \u0026ldquo;I have come to know Him,\u0026rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him: the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked. Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining. The one who says he is in the Light and yet hates his brother is in the darkness until now. The one who loves his brother abides in the Light and there is no cause for stumbling in him. But the one who hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes. I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you for His name\u0026rsquo;s sake. I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever. Children, it is the last hour; and just as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour. They went out from us, but they were not really of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out, so that it would be shown that they all are not of us. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know. I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie is of the truth. Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father; the one who confesses the Son has the Father also. As for you, let that abide in you which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father. This is the promise which He Himself made to us: eternal life. These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him. Now, little children, abide in Him, so that when He appears, we may have confidence and not shrink away from Him in shame at His coming. If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices righteousness is born of Him. See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God; and such we are. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. You know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin. No one who abides in Him sins; no one who sins has seen Him or knows Him. Little children, make sure no one deceives you; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous; the one who practices sin is of the devil; for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil. No one who is born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother. For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another; not as Cain, who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother\u0026rsquo;s were righteous. Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you. We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. We know love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoever has the world\u0026rsquo;s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him? Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth. We will know by this that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before Him in whatever our heart condemns us; for God is greater than our heart and knows all things. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight. This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us. The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. We love, because He first loved us. If someone says, \u0026ldquo;I love God,\u0026rdquo; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son. The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and Godwill for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make request for this. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death. We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, guard yourselves from idols.\n========\nWhat was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life—and the life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us—what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ. These things we write, so that our joy may be made complete. This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us. My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those ofthe whole world. By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments. The one who says, \u0026ldquo;I have come to know Him,\u0026rdquo; and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been perfected. By this we know that we are in Him: the one who says he abides in Him ought himself to walk in the same manner as He walked. Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you have heard. On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true Light is already shining.

I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one. Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.

Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God; and whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do the things that are pleasing in His sight. This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He commanded us. The one who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love. By this the love of God was manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world so that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. By this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit. We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. We love, because He first loved us. If someone says, \u0026ldquo;I love God,\u0026rdquo; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and observe His commandments. For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome. For whatever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is the one who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit and the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son. The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son. And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. This is the confidence which we have before Him, that, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him. If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and Godwill for him give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is a sin leading to death; I do not say that he should make request for this. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death. We know that no one who is born of God sins; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, guard yourselves from idols.\nNotes:: Daniel - Was Daniel out of communion with God when he prayed? No! He was confessing his sin and the sin of the people because they were in exile because of their sin. David - David confessed his sin to Nathan. Nathan told him his sin had already been forgiven. Proverbs - solomon speaks of how blessed is the man who admits his sin - referring to David. 2 Sam 12:13 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die\u0026rdquo;.\n"},{

      "content":"===== 1Jn 1:1 Lo que existía desde el principio, lo que hemos oído, lo que hemos visto con nuestros propios ojos, lo que hemos contemplado y lo que han tocado nuestras manos, esto escribimos acerca del Verbo de vida. 1Jn 1:2 Y la vida se manifestó. Nosotros la hemos visto, y damos testimonio y les anunciamos a ustedes la vida eterna que estaba con el Padre y se manifestó a nosotros. 1Jn 1:3 Lo que hemos visto y oído les proclamamos también a ustedes, para que también ustedes tengan comunión con nosotros. En verdad nuestra comunión es con el Padre y con Su Hijo Jesucristo. 1Jn 1:4 Les escribimos estas cosas para que nuestro gozo sea completo. 1Jn 1:5 Y este es el mensaje que hemos oído de Él y que les anunciamos: Dios es Luz, y en Él no hay ninguna tiniebla. 1Jn 1:6 Si decimos que tenemos comunión con Él, pero andamos en tinieblas, mentimos y no practicamos la verdad. 1Jn 1:7 Pero si andamos en la Luz, como Él está en la Luz, tenemos comunión los unos con los otros, y la sangre de Jesús Su Hijo nos limpia de todo pecado. 1Jn 1:8 Si decimos que no tenemos pecado, nos engañamos a nosotros mismos y la verdad no está en nosotros. 1Jn 1:9 Si confesamos nuestros pecados, Él es fiel y justo para perdonarnos los pecados y para limpiarnos de toda maldad. 1Jn 1:10 Si decimos que no hemos pecado, lo hacemos a Él mentiroso y Su palabra no está en nosotros.\nChrist Our Advocate\n1Jn 2:1 Hijitos míos, les escribo estas cosas para que no pequen. Y si alguien peca, tenemos Abogado para con el Padre, a Jesucristo el Justo. 1Jn 2:2 Él mismo es la propiciación por nuestros pecados, y no solo por los nuestros, sino también por los del mundo entero. 1Jn 2:3 Y en esto sabemos que lo hemos llegado a conocer: si guardamos Sus mandamientos. 1Jn 2:4 Él que dice: «Yo lo he llegado a conocer», y no guarda Sus mandamientos, es un mentiroso y la verdad no está en él. 1Jn 2:5 Pero el que guarda Su palabra, en él verdaderamente se ha perfeccionado el amor de Dios. En esto sabemos que estamos en Él. 1Jn 2:6 El que dice que permanece en Él, debe andar como Él anduvo. The New Commandment\n1Jn 2:7 Amados, no les escribo un mandamiento nuevo, sino un mandamiento antiguo, que han tenido desde el principio. El mandamiento antiguo es la palabra que han oído. 1Jn 2:8 Por otra parte, les escribo un mandamiento nuevo, el cual es verdadero en Él y en ustedes, porque las tinieblas van pasando, y la Luz verdadera ya está alumbrando. 1Jn 2:9 El que dice que está en la Luz y aborrece a su hermano, está aún en tinieblas. 1Jn 2:10 El que ama a su hermano, permanece en la Luz y no hay causa de tropiezo en él. 1Jn 2:11 Pero el que aborrece a su hermano, está en tinieblas y anda en tinieblas, y no sabe adónde va, porque las tinieblas han cegado sus ojos. 1Jn 2:12 Les escribo a ustedes, hijos, porque sus pecados les han sido perdonados por el nombre de Cristo. 1Jn 2:13 Les escribo a ustedes, padres, porque conocen a Aquel que ha sido desde el principio. Les escribo a ustedes, jóvenes, porque han vencido al maligno. Les he escrito a ustedes, niños, porque conocen al Padre. 1Jn 2:14 Les he escrito a ustedes, padres, porque conocen a Aquel que ha sido desde el principio. Les he escrito a ustedes, jóvenes, porque son fuertes y la palabra de Dios permanece en ustedes y han vencido al maligno. Do Not Love the World\n1Jn 2:15 No amen al mundo ni las cosas que están en el mundo. Si alguien ama al mundo, el amor del Padre no está en él. 1Jn 2:16 Porque todo lo que hay en el mundo, la pasión de la carne, la pasión de los ojos, y la arrogancia de la vida, no proviene del Padre, sino del mundo. 1Jn 2:17 El mundo pasa, y también sus pasiones, pero el que hace la voluntad de Dios permanece para siempre. Warning Concerning Antichrists\n1Jn 2:18 Hijitos, es la última hora, y así como oyeron que el anticristo viene, también ahora han surgido muchos anticristos. Por eso sabemos que es la última hora. 1Jn 2:19 Ellos salieron de nosotros, pero en realidad no eran de nosotros, porque si hubieran sido de nosotros, habrían permanecido con nosotros. Pero salieron, a fin de que se manifestara que no todos son de nosotros. 1Jn 2:20 Pero ustedes tienen la unción del Santo, y todos ustedes lo saben. 1Jn 2:21 No les he escrito porque ignoren la verdad, sino porque la conocen y porque ninguna mentira procede de la verdad. 1Jn 2:22 ¿Quién es el mentiroso, sino el que niega que Jesús es el Cristo? Este es el anticristo, el que niega al Padre y al Hijo. 1Jn 2:23 Todo aquel que niega al Hijo tampoco tiene al Padre; el que confiesa al Hijo tiene también al Padre. 1Jn 2:24 En cuanto a ustedes, que permanezca en ustedes lo que oyeron desde el principio. Si en ustedes permanece lo que oyeron desde el principio, ustedes también permanecerán en el Hijo y en el Padre. 1Jn 2:25 Y esta es la promesa que Él mismo nos hizo: la vida eterna. 1Jn 2:26 Les he escrito estas cosas respecto a los que están tratando de engañarlos. 1Jn 2:27 En cuanto a ustedes, la unción que recibieron de Él permanece en ustedes, y no tienen necesidad de que nadie les enseñe. Pero así como Su unción les enseña acerca de todas las cosas, y es verdadera y no mentira, y así como les ha enseñado, ustedes permanecen en Él. Children of God\n1Jn 2:28 Y ahora, hijos, permanezcan en Él, para que cuando se manifieste, tengamos confianza y no nos apartemos de Él avergonzados en Su venida. 1Jn 2:29 Si saben que Él es justo, saben también que todo el que hace justicia es nacido de Él.\n1Jn 3:1 Miren cuán gran amor nos ha otorgado el Padre: que seamos llamados hijos de Dios. Y eso somos. Por esto el mundo no nos conoce, porque no lo conoció a Él. 1Jn 3:2 Amados, ahora somos hijos de Dios y aún no se ha manifestado lo que habremos de ser. Pero sabemos que cuando Cristo se manifieste, seremos semejantes a Él, porque lo veremos como Él es. 1Jn 3:3 Y todo el que tiene esta esperanza puesta en Él, se purifica, así como Él es puro. 1Jn 3:4 Todo el que practica el pecado, practica también la infracción de la ley, pues el pecado es infracción de la ley. 1Jn 3:5 Ustedes saben que Cristo se manifestó a fin de quitar los pecados, y en Él no hay pecado. 1Jn 3:6 Todo el que permanece en Él, no peca. Todo el que peca, ni lo ha visto ni lo ha conocido. 1Jn 3:7 Hijos míos, que nadie los engañe. El que practica la justicia es justo, así como Él es justo. 1Jn 3:8 El que practica el pecado es del diablo, porque el diablo ha pecado desde el principio. El Hijo de Dios se manifestó con este propósito: para destruir las obras del diablo. 1Jn 3:9 Ninguno que es nacido de Dios practica el pecado, porque la simiente de Dios permanece en él. No puede pecar, porque es nacido de Dios. 1Jn 3:10 En esto se reconocen los hijos de Dios y los hijos del diablo: todo aquel que no practica la justicia, no es de Dios; tampoco aquel que no ama a su hermano. Love One Another\n1Jn 3:11 Porque este es el mensaje que ustedes han oído desde el principio: que nos amemos unos a otros. 1Jn 3:12 No como Caín que era del maligno, y mató a su hermano. ¿Y por qué causa lo mató? Porque sus obras eran malas, y las de su hermano justas. 1Jn 3:13 Hermanos, no se maravillen si el mundo los odia. 1Jn 3:14 Nosotros sabemos que hemos pasado de muerte a vida porque amamos a los hermanos. El que no ama permanece en muerte. 1Jn 3:15 Todo el que aborrece a su hermano es un asesino, y ustedes saben que ningún asesino tiene vida eterna permanente en él. 1Jn 3:16 En esto conocemos el amor: en que Él puso Su vida por nosotros. También nosotros debemos poner nuestras vidas por los hermanos. 1Jn 3:17 Pero el que tiene bienes de este mundo, y ve a su hermano en necesidad y cierra su corazón contra él, ¿cómo puede morar el amor de Dios en él? 1Jn 3:18 Hijos, no amemos de palabra ni de lengua, sino de hecho y en verdad. 1Jn 3:19 En esto sabremos que somos de la verdad, y aseguraremos nuestros corazones delante de Él 1Jn 3:20 en cualquier cosa en que nuestro corazón nos condene. Porque Dios es mayor que nuestro corazón y Él sabe todas las cosas. 1Jn 3:21 Amados, si nuestro corazón no nos condena, confianza tenemos delante de Dios. 1Jn 3:22 Y todo lo que pidamos lo recibimos de Él, porque guardamos Sus mandamientos y hacemos las cosas que son agradables delante de Él. 1Jn 3:23 Y este es Su mandamiento: que creamos en el nombre de Su Hijo Jesucristo, y que nos amemos unos a otros como Él nos ha mandado. 1Jn 3:24 El que guarda Sus mandamientos permanece en Él y Dios en él. Y en esto sabemos que Él permanece en nosotros: por el Espíritu que nos ha dado.\nTest the Spirits\n1Jn 4:1 Amados, no crean a todo espíritu, sino prueben los espíritus para ver si son de Dios, porque muchos falsos profetas han salido al mundo. 1Jn 4:2 En esto ustedes conocen el Espíritu de Dios: todo espíritu que confiesa que Jesucristo ha venido en carne, es de Dios. 1Jn 4:3 Y todo espíritu que no confiesa a Jesús, no es de Dios, y este es el espíritu del anticristo, del cual ustedes han oído que viene, y que ahora ya está en el mundo. 1Jn 4:4 Hijos míos, ustedes son de Dios y han vencido a los falsos profetas, porque mayor es Aquel que está en ustedes que el que está en el mundo. 1Jn 4:5 Ellos son del mundo; por eso hablan de parte del mundo, y el mundo los oye. 1Jn 4:6 Nosotros somos de Dios. El que conoce a Dios, nos oye; el que no es de Dios, no nos oye. En esto conocemos el espíritu de la verdad y el espíritu del error. God Is Love\n1Jn 4:7 Amados, amémonos unos a otros, porque el amor es de Dios, y todo el que ama es nacido de Dios y conoce a Dios. 1Jn 4:8 El que no ama no conoce a Dios, porque Dios es amor. 1Jn 4:9 En esto se manifestó el amor de Dios en nosotros: en que Dios ha enviado a Su Hijo unigénito al mundo para que vivamos por medio de Él. 1Jn 4:10 En esto consiste el amor: no en que nosotros hayamos amado a Dios, sino en que Él nos amó a nosotros y envió a Su Hijo como propiciación por nuestros pecados. 1Jn 4:11 Amados, si Dios así nos amó, también nosotros debemos amarnos unos a otros. 1Jn 4:12 A Dios nunca lo ha visto nadie. Si nos amamos unos a otros, Dios permanece en nosotros y Su amor se perfecciona en nosotros. 1Jn 4:13 En esto sabemos que permanecemos en Él y Él en nosotros: en que nos ha dado de Su Espíritu. 1Jn 4:14 Y nosotros hemos visto y damos testimonio de que el Padre envió al Hijo para ser el Salvador del mundo. 1Jn 4:15 Todo aquel que confiesa que Jesús es el Hijo de Dios, Dios permanece en él y él en Dios. 1Jn 4:16 Y nosotros hemos llegado a conocer y hemos creído el amor que Dios tiene para nosotros. Dios es amor, y el que permanece en amor permanece en Dios y Dios permanece en él. 1Jn 4:17 En esto se perfecciona el amor en nosotros, para que tengamos confianza en el día del juicio, pues como Él es, así somos también nosotros en este mundo. 1Jn 4:18 En el amor no hay temor, sino que el perfecto amor echa fuera el temor, porque el temor involucra castigo, y el que teme no es hecho perfecto en el amor. 1Jn 4:19 Nosotros amamos porque Él nos amó primero. 1Jn 4:20 Si alguien dice: «Yo amo a Dios», pero aborrece a su hermano, es un mentiroso. Porque el que no ama a su hermano, a quien ha visto, no puede amar a Dios a quien no ha visto. 1Jn 4:21 Y este mandamiento tenemos de Él: que el que ama a Dios, ame también a su hermano.\nOvercoming the World\n1Jn 5:1 Todo aquel que cree que Jesús es el Cristo, es nacido de Dios. Todo aquel que ama al Padre, ama al que ha nacido de Él. 1Jn 5:2 En esto sabemos que amamos a los hijos de Dios: cuando amamos a Dios y guardamos Sus mandamientos. 1Jn 5:3 Porque este es el amor de Dios: que guardemos Sus mandamientos, y Sus mandamientos no son difíciles. 1Jn 5:4 Porque todo lo que es nacido de Dios vence al mundo. Y esta es la victoria que ha vencido al mundo: nuestra fe. 1Jn 5:5 ¿Y quién es el que vence al mundo, sino el que cree que Jesús es el Hijo de Dios? Testimony Concerning the Son of God\n1Jn 5:6 Este es Aquel que vino mediante agua y sangre, Jesucristo; no solo con agua, sino con agua y con sangre. Y el Espíritu es el que da testimonio, porque el Espíritu es la verdad. 1Jn 5:7 Porque tres son los que dan testimonio en el cielo: el Padre, el Verbo, y el Espíritu Santo, y estos tres son uno. Y tres son los que dan testimonio en la tierra: 1Jn 5:8 el Espíritu, el agua, y la sangre, y los tres concuerdan. 1Jn 5:9 Si recibimos el testimonio de los hombres, mayor es el testimonio de Dios; porque este es el testimonio de Dios: que Él ha dado testimonio acerca de Su Hijo. 1Jn 5:10 El que cree en el Hijo de Dios tiene el testimonio en sí mismo. El que no cree a Dios, ha hecho a Dios mentiroso, porque no ha creído en el testimonio que Dios ha dado respecto a Su Hijo. 1Jn 5:11 Y el testimonio es este: que Dios nos ha dado vida eterna, y esta vida está en Su Hijo. 1Jn 5:12 El que tiene al Hijo tiene la vida, y el que no tiene al Hijo de Dios, no tiene la vida. That You May Know\n1Jn 5:13 Estas cosas les he escrito a ustedes que creen en el nombre del Hijo de Dios, para que sepan que tienen vida eterna. 1Jn 5:14 Esta es la confianza que tenemos delante de Él, que si pedimos cualquier cosa conforme a Su voluntad, Él nos oye. 1Jn 5:15 Y si sabemos que Él nos oye en cualquier cosa que pidamos, sabemos que tenemos las peticiones que le hemos hecho. 1Jn 5:16 Si alguien ve a su hermano cometiendo un pecado que no lleva a la muerte, pedirá, y por él Dios dará vida a los que cometen pecado que no lleva a la muerte. Hay un pecado que lleva a la muerte; yo no digo que se deba pedir por ese. 1Jn 5:17 Toda injusticia es pecado, pero hay pecado que no lleva a la muerte. 1Jn 5:18 Sabemos que todo el que ha nacido de Dios, no peca; sino que Aquel que nació de Dios lo guarda y el maligno no lo toca. 1Jn 5:19 Sabemos que somos de Dios, y que el mundo entero está bajo el poder del maligno. 1Jn 5:20 Y sabemos que el Hijo de Dios ha venido y nos ha dado entendimiento a fin de que conozcamos a Aquel que es verdadero; y nosotros estamos en Aquel que es verdadero, en Su Hijo Jesucristo. Este es el verdadero Dios y la vida eterna. 1Jn 5:21 Hijos, aléjense de los ídolos.\n======\nFecha de escritura: Es posible que 1, 2 y 3 Juan fueron escritos (sin saber el orden) alrededor del año 65d.C. .

Y la vida se manifestó. Nosotros la hemos visto, y damos testimonio y les anunciamos a ustedes la vida eterna que estaba con el Padre y se manifestó a nosotros. Lo que hemos visto y oído les proclamamos también a ustedes, para que también ustedes tengan comunión con nosotros. En verdad nuestra comunión es con el Padre y con Su Hijo Jesucristo. Les escribimos estas cosas para que nuestro gozo sea completo. Y este es el mensaje que hemos oído de Él y que les anunciamos: Dios es Luz, y en Él no hay ninguna tiniebla. Si decimos que tenemos comunión con Él, pero andamos en tinieblas, mentimos y no practicamos la verdad. Pero si andamos en la Luz, como Él está en la Luz, tenemos comunión los unos con los otros, y la sangre de Jesús Su Hijo nos limpia de todo pecado. Si decimos que no tenemos pecado, nos engañamos a nosotros mismos y la verdad no está en nosotros. Si confesamos nuestros pecados, Él es fiel y justo para perdonarnos los pecados y para limpiarnos de toda maldad. Si decimos que no hemos pecado, lo hacemos a Él mentiroso y Su palabra no está en nosotros. Hijitos míos, les escribo estas cosas para que no pequen. Y si alguien peca, tenemos Abogado para con el Padre, a Jesucristo el Justo. Él mismo es la propiciación por nuestros pecados, y no solo por los nuestros, sino también por los del mundo entero. Y en esto sabemos que lo hemos llegado a conocer: si guardamos Sus mandamientos. Él que dice: «Yo lo he llegado a conocer», y no guarda Sus mandamientos, es un mentiroso y la verdad no está en él. Pero el que guarda Su palabra, en él verdaderamente se ha perfeccionado el amor de Dios. En esto sabemos que estamos en Él. El que dice que permanece en Él, debe andar como Él anduvo. Amados, no les escribo un mandamiento nuevo, sino un mandamiento antiguo, que han tenido desde el principio. El mandamiento antiguo es la palabra que han oído. Por otra parte, les escribo un mandamiento nuevo, el cual es verdadero en Él y en ustedes, porque las tinieblas van pasando, y la Luz verdadera ya está alumbrando. El que dice que está en la Luz y aborrece a su hermano, está aún en tinieblas. El que ama a su hermano, permanece en la Luz y no hay causa de tropiezo en él. Pero el que aborrece a su hermano, está en tinieblas y anda en tinieblas, y no sabe adónde va, porque las tinieblas han cegado sus ojos. Les escribo a ustedes, hijos, porque sus pecados les han sido perdonados por el nombre de Cristo. Les escribo a ustedes, padres, porque conocen a Aquel que ha sido desde el principio. Les escribo a ustedes, jóvenes, porque han vencido al maligno. Les he escrito a ustedes, niños, porque conocen al Padre. Les he escrito a ustedes, padres, porque conocen a Aquel que ha sido desde el principio. Les he escrito a ustedes, jóvenes, porque son fuertes y la palabra de Dios permanece en ustedes y han vencido al maligno. No amen al mundo ni las cosas que están en el mundo. Si alguien ama al mundo, el amor del Padre no está en él. Porque todo lo que hay en el mundo, la pasión de la carne, la pasión de los ojos, y la arrogancia de la vida, no proviene del Padre, sino del mundo. El mundo pasa, y también sus pasiones, pero el que hace la voluntad de Dios permanece para siempre. Hijitos, es la última hora, y así como oyeron que el anticristo viene, también ahora han surgido muchos anticristos. Por eso sabemos que es la última hora. Ellos salieron de nosotros, pero en realidad no eran de nosotros, porque si hubieran sido de nosotros, habrían permanecido con nosotros. Pero salieron, a fin de que se manifestara que no todos son de nosotros. Pero ustedes tienen la unción del Santo, y todos ustedes lo saben. No les he escrito porque ignoren la verdad, sino porque la conocen y porque ninguna mentira procede de la verdad. ¿Quién es el mentiroso, sino el que niega que Jesús es el Cristo? Este es el anticristo, el que niega al Padre y al Hijo. Todo aquel que niega al Hijo tampoco tiene al Padre; el que confiesa al Hijo tiene también al Padre. En cuanto a ustedes, que permanezca en ustedes lo que oyeron desde el principio. Si en ustedes permanece lo que oyeron desde el principio, ustedes también permanecerán en el Hijo y en el Padre. Y esta es la promesa que Él mismo nos hizo: la vida eterna. Les he escrito estas cosas respecto a los que están tratando de engañarlos. En cuanto a ustedes, la unción que recibieron de Él permanece en ustedes, y no tienen necesidad de que nadie les enseñe. Pero así como Su unción les enseña acerca de todas las cosas, y es verdadera y no mentira, y así como les ha enseñado, ustedes permanecen en Él. Y ahora, hijos, permanezcan en Él, para que cuando se manifieste, tengamos confianza y no nos apartemos de Él avergonzados en Su venida. Si saben que Él es justo, saben también que todo el que hace justicia es nacido de Él. Miren cuán gran amor nos ha otorgado el Padre: que seamos llamados hijos de Dios. Y eso somos. Por esto el mundo no nos conoce, porque no lo conoció a Él. Amados, ahora somos hijos de Dios y aún no se ha manifestado lo que habremos de ser. Pero sabemos que cuando Cristo se manifieste, seremos semejantes a Él, porque lo veremos como Él es. Y todo el que tiene esta esperanza puesta en Él, se purifica, así como Él es puro. Todo el que practica el pecado, practica también la infracción de la ley, pues el pecado es infracción de la ley. Ustedes saben que Cristo se manifestó a fin de quitar los pecados, y en Él no hay pecado. Todo el que permanece en Él, no peca. Todo el que peca, ni lo ha visto ni lo ha conocido. Hijos míos, que nadie los engañe. El que practica la justicia es justo, así como Él es justo. El que practica el pecado es del diablo, porque el diablo ha pecado desde el principio. El Hijo de Dios se manifestó con este propósito: para destruir las obras del diablo. Ninguno que es nacido de Dios practica el pecado, porque la simiente de Dios permanece en él. No puede pecar, porque es nacido de Dios. En esto se reconocen los hijos de Dios y los hijos del diablo: todo aquel que no practica la justicia, no es de Dios; tampoco aquel que no ama a su hermano. Porque este es el mensaje que ustedes han oído desde el principio: que nos amemos unos a otros. No como Caín que era del maligno, y mató a su hermano. ¿Y por qué causa lo mató? Porque sus obras eran malas, y las de su hermano justas. Hermanos, no se maravillen si el mundo los odia. Nosotros sabemos que hemos pasado de muerte a vida porque amamos a los hermanos. El que no ama permanece en muerte. Todo el que aborrece a su hermano es un asesino, y ustedes saben que ningún asesino tiene vida eterna permanente en él. En esto conocemos el amor: en que Él puso Su vida por nosotros. También nosotros debemos poner nuestras vidas por los hermanos. Pero el que tiene bienes de este mundo, y ve a su hermano en necesidad y cierra su corazón contra él, ¿cómo puede morar el amor de Dios en él? Hijos, no amemos de palabra ni de lengua, sino de hecho y en verdad. En esto sabremos que somos de la verdad, y aseguraremos nuestros corazones delante de Él en cualquier cosa en que nuestro corazón nos condene. Porque Dios es mayor que nuestro corazón y Él sabe todas las cosas. Amados, si nuestro corazón no nos condena, confianza tenemos delante de Dios. Y todo lo que pidamos lo recibimos de Él, porque guardamos Sus mandamientos y hacemos las cosas que son agradables delante de Él. Y este es Su mandamiento: que creamos en el nombre de Su Hijo Jesucristo, y que nos amemos unos a otros como Él nos ha mandado. El que guarda Sus mandamientos permanece en Él y Dios en él. Y en esto sabemos que Él permanece en nosotros: por el Espíritu que nos ha dado. Amados, no crean a todo espíritu, sino prueben los espíritus para ver si son de Dios, porque muchos falsos profetas han salido al mundo. En esto ustedes conocen el Espíritu de Dios: todo espíritu que confiesa que Jesucristo ha venido en carne, es de Dios. Y todo espíritu que no confiesa a Jesús, no es de Dios, y este es el espíritu del anticristo, del cual ustedes han oído que viene, y que ahora ya está en el mundo. Hijos míos, ustedes son de Dios y han vencido a los falsos profetas, porque mayor es Aquel que está en ustedes que el que está en el mundo. Ellos son del mundo; por eso hablan de parte del mundo, y el mundo los oye. Nosotros somos de Dios. El que conoce a Dios, nos oye; el que no es de Dios, no nos oye. En esto conocemos el espíritu de la verdad y el espíritu del error. Amados, amémonos unos a otros, porque el amor es de Dios, y todo el que ama es nacido de Dios y conoce a Dios. El que no ama no conoce a Dios, porque Dios es amor. En esto se manifestó el amor de Dios en nosotros: en que Dios ha enviado a Su Hijo unigénito al mundo para que vivamos por medio de Él. En esto consiste el amor: no en que nosotros hayamos amado a Dios, sino en que Él nos amó a nosotros y envió a Su Hijo como propiciación por nuestros pecados. Amados, si Dios así nos amó, también nosotros debemos amarnos unos a otros. A Dios nunca lo ha visto nadie. Si nos amamos unos a otros, Dios permanece en nosotros y Su amor se perfecciona en nosotros. En esto sabemos que permanecemos en Él y Él en nosotros: en que nos ha dado de Su Espíritu. Y nosotros hemos visto y damos testimonio de que el Padre envió al Hijo para ser el Salvador del mundo. Todo aquel que confiesa que Jesús es el Hijo de Dios, Dios permanece en él y él en Dios. Y nosotros hemos llegado a conocer y hemos creído el amor que Dios tiene para nosotros. Dios es amor, y el que permanece en amor permanece en Dios y Dios permanece en él. En esto se perfecciona el amor en nosotros, para que tengamos confianza en el día del juicio, pues como Él es, así somos también nosotros en este mundo. En el amor no hay temor, sino que el perfecto amor echa fuera el temor, porque el temor involucra castigo, y el que teme no es hecho perfecto en el amor. Nosotros amamos porque Él nos amó primero. Si alguien dice: «Yo amo a Dios», pero aborrece a su hermano, es un mentiroso. Porque el que no ama a su hermano, a quien ha visto, no puede amar a Dios a quien no ha visto. Y este mandamiento tenemos de Él: que el que ama a Dios, ame también a su hermano. Todo aquel que cree que Jesús es el Cristo, es nacido de Dios. Todo aquel que ama al Padre, ama al que ha nacido de Él. En esto sabemos que amamos a los hijos de Dios: cuando amamos a Dios y guardamos Sus mandamientos. Porque este es el amor de Dios: que guardemos Sus mandamientos, y Sus mandamientos no son difíciles. Porque todo lo que es nacido de Dios vence al mundo. Y esta es la victoria que ha vencido al mundo: nuestra fe. ¿Y quién es el que vence al mundo, sino el que cree que Jesús es el Hijo de Dios? Este es Aquel que vino mediante agua y sangre, Jesucristo; no solo con agua, sino con agua y con sangre. Y el Espíritu es el que da testimonio, porque el Espíritu es la verdad. Porque tres son los que dan testimonio en el cielo: el Padre, el Verbo, y el Espíritu Santo, y estos tres son uno. Y tres son los que dan testimonio en la tierra: el Espíritu, el agua, y la sangre, y los tres concuerdan. Si recibimos el testimonio de los hombres, mayor es el testimonio de Dios; porque este es el testimonio de Dios: que Él ha dado testimonio acerca de Su Hijo. El que cree en el Hijo de Dios tiene el testimonio en sí mismo. El que no cree a Dios, ha hecho a Dios mentiroso, porque no ha creído en el testimonio que Dios ha dado respecto a Su Hijo. Y el testimonio es este: que Dios nos ha dado vida eterna, y esta vida está en Su Hijo. El que tiene al Hijo tiene la vida, y el que no tiene al Hijo de Dios, no tiene la vida. Estas cosas les he escrito a ustedes que creen en el nombre del Hijo de Dios, para que sepan que tienen vida eterna. Esta es la confianza que tenemos delante de Él, que si pedimos cualquier cosa conforme a Su voluntad, Él nos oye. Y si sabemos que Él nos oye en cualquier cosa que pidamos, sabemos que tenemos las peticiones que le hemos hecho. Si alguien ve a su hermano cometiendo un pecado que no lleva a la muerte, pedirá, y por él Dios dará vida a los que cometen pecado que no lleva a la muerte. Hay un pecado que lleva a la muerte; yo no digo que se deba pedir por ese. Toda injusticia es pecado, pero hay pecado que no lleva a la muerte. Sabemos que todo el que ha nacido de Dios, no peca; sino que Aquel que nació de Dios lo guarda y el maligno no lo toca. Sabemos que somos de Dios, y que el mundo entero está bajo el poder del maligno. Y sabemos que el Hijo de Dios ha venido y nos ha dado entendimiento a fin de que conozcamos a Aquel que es verdadero; y nosotros estamos en Aquel que es verdadero, en Su Hijo Jesucristo. Este es el verdadero Dios y la vida eterna. Hijos, aléjense de los ídolos.\n"},{

      "content":"1Pe 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen 1Pe 1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. Born Again to a Living Hope 1Pe 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 1Pe 1:4 to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, 1Pe 1:5 who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 1Pe 1:6 In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, 1Pe 1:7 so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 1Pe 1:8 and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, 1Pe 1:9 obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. 1Pe 1:10 As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, 1Pe 1:11 seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. 1Pe 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look. Called to Be Holy 1Pe 1:13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 1Pe 1:14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, 1Pe 1:15 but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; 1Pe 1:16 because it is written, \u0026ldquo;YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\u0026rdquo; 1Pe 1:17 If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one\u0026rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; 1Pe 1:18 knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, 1Pe 1:19 but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. 1Pe 1:20 For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you 1Pe 1:21 who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. 1Pe 1:22 Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, 1Pe 1:23 for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. 1Pe 1:24 For, \u0026ldquo;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, 1Pe 1:25 BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; And this is the word which was preached to you. 1Pe 2:1 Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, 1Pe 2:2 like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, 1Pe 2:3 if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. 1Pe 2:4 And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, 1Pe 2:5 you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 1Pe 2:6 For this is contained in Scripture: \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; 1Pe 2:7 This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, \u0026ldquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,\u0026rdquo; 1Pe 2:8 and, \u0026ldquo;A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE\u0026rdquo;; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. 1Pe 2:9 But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God\u0026rsquo;s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 1Pe 2:10 for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY. 1Pe 2:11 Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. 1Pe 2:12 Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submission to Authority 1Pe 2:13 Submit yourselves for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, 1Pe 2:14 or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. 1Pe 2:15 For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. 1Pe 2:16 Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. 1Pe 2:17 Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. 1Pe 2:18 Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. 1Pe 2:19 For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. 1Pe 2:20 For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God. 1Pe 2:21 For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, 1Pe 2:22 WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH; 1Pe 2:23 and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously; 1Pe 2:24 and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed. 1Pe 2:25 For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls. 1Pe 3:1 In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, 1Pe 3:2 as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior. 1Pe 3:3 Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; 1Pe 3:4 but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. 1Pe 3:5 For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; 1Pe 3:6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear. 1Pe 3:7 You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. Suffering for Righteousness\u0026rsquo; Sake 1Pe 3:8 To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; 1Pe 3:9 not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. 1Pe 3:10 For, \u0026ldquo;THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT. 1Pe 3:11 \u0026ldquo;HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT. 1Pe 3:12 \u0026ldquo;FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.\u0026rdquo; 1Pe 3:13 Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? 1Pe 3:14 But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, 1Pe 3:15 but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; 1Pe 3:16 and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. 1Pe 3:17 For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. 1Pe 3:18 For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; 1Pe 3:19 in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, 1Pe 3:20 who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. 1Pe 3:21 Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 1Pe 3:22 who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him. 1Pe 4:1 Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 1Pe 4:2 so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. 1Pe 4:3 For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. 1Pe 4:4 In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you; 1Pe 4:5 but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 1Pe 4:6 For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God. 1Pe 4:7 The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer. 1Pe 4:8 Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. 1Pe 4:9 Be hospitable to one another without complaint. 1Pe 4:10 As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 1Pe 4:11 Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Suffering as a Christian 1Pe 4:12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; 1Pe 4:13 but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. 1Pe 4:14 If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. 1Pe 4:15 Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; 1Pe 4:16 but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name. 1Pe 4:17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? 1Pe 4:18 AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER? 1Pe 4:19 Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right. 1Pe 5:1 Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, 1Pe 5:2 shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; 1Pe 5:3 nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. 1Pe 5:4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 1Pe 5:5 You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. 1Pe 5:6 Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, 1Pe 5:7 casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. 1Pe 5:8 Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 1Pe 5:9 But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. 1Pe 5:10 After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. 1Pe 5:11 To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. Final Greetings 1Pe 5:12 Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! 1Pe 5:13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. 1Pe 5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.\n====\nPeter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look. Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, \u0026ldquo;YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\u0026rdquo; If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one\u0026rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. For, \u0026ldquo;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; And this is the word which was preached to you. Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, \u0026ldquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE\u0026rdquo;; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God\u0026rsquo;s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY. Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submit yourselves for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God. For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH; and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously; 1Pe 2:24 and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed. For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls. In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior. Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear. You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered. To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. For, \u0026ldquo;THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT. \u0026ldquo;HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT. \u0026ldquo;FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.\u0026rdquo; Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him. Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you; but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God. The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer. Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaint. As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name. For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER? Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right. Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.\n=====Phrased\nPeter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven— things into which angels long to look. Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, \u0026ldquo;YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\u0026rdquo; If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one\u0026rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. For, \u0026ldquo;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; And this is the word which was preached to you. Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, \u0026ldquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE\u0026rdquo;; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God\u0026rsquo;s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY. Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submit yourselves for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.

Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name. For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God? AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER? Title# Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right. Instructions to elders# Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. Younger Men# You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; Everyone# and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. Title# Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you. To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! Final greetings# She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ. ==========Outline\nIntro# 1 Peter 1:1 Author and Readers# 1 Peter - Peter\u0026hellip; Peter identifies himself as the author of the book.# 1 Peteran apostle\u0026hellip; - Peter is an apostle which means he is sent.# 1 Peter of Jesus Christ\u0026hellip; - Peter is not just any apostle, he is an apostle of Jesus Christ. This means Peter is one of the 12 apostles of the Lamb. Revelation 21:14# 1 Peter\u0026hellip;To those who reside as aliens scattered throughout\u0026hellip;Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia\u0026hellip; - Peter writes to Jews who are scattered as aliens.# More on the readers# who are chosen - all believers are chosen of God.# chosen of God\u0026hellip;according to the foreknowledge of God# the Father,# *by* *the sanctifying work* *of the Spirit,* *to obey* *Jesus Christ* *and be sprinkled with His blood:* Special greetings# May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.\nPurpose of writing# In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory, obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.\nGrace is revealed!# As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven— things into which angels long to look.\nFix your hope on the coming grace# Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.\nChildren# As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance, but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, \u0026ldquo;YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.\u0026rdquo; If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one\u0026rsquo;s work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth; knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. For He [Christ] was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God. Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart, for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. For, \u0026ldquo;ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; And this is the word which was preached to you.\nTitle# Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For this is contained in Scripture: \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, \u0026ldquo;THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE\u0026rdquo;; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed. But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God\u0026rsquo;s OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.\nExhortation# Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation. Submit yourselves for the Lord\u0026rsquo;s sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God. Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.\nServants# Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God. For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH; and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously; and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed. For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.\nWives# In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior. Your adornment must not be merely external— braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses; but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands; just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.\nHusbands# You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.\nAll of you# To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit; not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. For, \u0026ldquo;THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT. \u0026ldquo;HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT. \u0026ldquo;FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL.\u0026rdquo; Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence; and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame. For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong. For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you— not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience— through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.\nTitle# Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God. For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries. In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you; but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God. The end of all things is near;\nServing one another in the Spirit# therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer. Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaint. As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.\nTesting# Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you; but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler; but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name.

Porque mientras hagan estas cosas nunca caerán.\n2Pe 1:11 Pues de esta manera les será concedida ampliamente la entrada al reino eterno de nuestro Señor y Salvador Jesucristo.\n2Pe 1:12 Por tanto, siempre estaré listo para recordarles estas cosas, aunque ustedes ya las saben y han sido confirmados en la verdad que está presente en ustedes.\n2Pe 1:13 También considero justo, mientras esté en este cuerpo, estimularlos recordándoles estas cosas,\n2Pe 1:14 sabiendo que mi separación del cuerpo terrenal es inminente, tal como me lo ha declarado nuestro Señor Jesucristo.\n2Pe 1:15 Además, yo procuraré con diligencia, que en todo tiempo, después de mi partida, ustedes puedan recordar estas cosas.\nChrist\u0026rsquo;s Glory and the Prophetic Word# 2Pe 1:16 Porque cuando les dimos a conocer el poder y la venida de nuestro Señor Jesucristo, no seguimos fábulas ingeniosamente inventadas, sino que fuimos testigos oculares de Su majestad.\n2Pe 1:17 Pues cuando Él recibió honor y gloria de Dios Padre, la Majestuosa Gloria le hizo esta declaración: «Este es Mi Hijo amado en quien me he complacido».\n2Pe 1:18 Nosotros mismos escuchamos esta declaración, hecha desde el cielo cuando estábamos con Él en el monte santo.\n2Pe 1:19 Y así tenemos la palabra profética más segura, a la cual ustedes hacen bien en prestar atención como a una lámpara que brilla en el lugar oscuro, hasta que el día despunte y el lucero de la mañana aparezca en sus corazones.\n2Pe 1:20 Pero ante todo sepan esto, que ninguna profecía de la Escritura es asunto de interpretación personal,\n2Pe 1:21 pues ninguna profecía fue dada jamás por un acto de voluntad humana, sino que hombres inspirados por el Espíritu Santo hablaron de parte de Dios.\n2Pe 2:1 Pero se levantaron falsos profetas entre el pueblo, así como habrá también falsos maestros entre ustedes, los cuales encubiertamente introducirán herejías destructoras, negando incluso al Señor que los compró, trayendo sobre sí una destrucción repentina.\n2Pe 2:2 Muchos seguirán su sensualidad, y por causa de ellos, el camino de la verdad será blasfemado.\n2Pe 2:3 En su avaricia los explotarán con palabras falsas. El juicio de ellos, desde hace mucho tiempo no está ocioso, ni su perdición dormida.\n2Pe 2:4 Porque Dios no perdonó a los ángeles cuando pecaron, sino que los arrojó al infierno y los entregó a fosos de tinieblas, reservados para juicio.\n2Pe 2:5 Tampoco perdonó al mundo antiguo, sino que guardó a Noé, un predicador de justicia, con otros siete, cuando trajo el diluvio sobre el mundo de los impíos.\n2Pe 2:6 También condenó a la destrucción las ciudades de Sodoma y Gomorra, reduciéndolas a cenizas, poniéndolas de ejemplo para los que habrían de vivir impíamente después.\n2Pe 2:7 Además rescató al justo Lot, abrumado por la conducta sensual de hombres libertinos\n2Pe 2:8 (porque ese justo, por lo que veía y oía mientras vivía entre ellos, diariamente sentía su alma justa atormentada por las iniquidades de ellos).\n2Pe 2:9 El Señor, pues, sabe rescatar de tentación a los piadosos, y reservar a los injustos bajo castigo para el día del juicio,\n2Pe 2:10 especialmente a los que andan tras la carne en sus deseos corrompidos y desprecian la autoridad. Atrevidos y obstinados, no tiemblan cuando blasfeman de las majestades angélicas,\n2Pe 2:11 cuando los ángeles, que son mayores en fuerza y en potencia, no pronuncian juicio injurioso contra ellos delante del Señor.\n2Pe 2:12 Pero estos, como animales irracionales, nacidos como criaturas de instinto para ser capturados y destruidos, blasfemando de lo que ignoran, serán también destruidos con la destrucción de esas criaturas,\n2Pe 2:13 sufriendo el mal como pago de su iniquidad. Cuentan por deleite andar en placeres disolutos durante el día. Son manchas e inmundicias, deleitándose en sus engaños mientras banquetean con ustedes.\n2Pe 2:14 Tienen los ojos llenos de adulterio y nunca cesan de pecar. Seducen a las almas inestables. Tienen un corazón ejercitado en la avaricia; son hijos de maldición.\n2Pe 2:15 Abandonando el camino recto, se han extraviado, siguiendo el camino de Balaam, el hijo de Beor, quien amó el pago de la iniquidad,\n2Pe 2:16 pero fue reprendido por su transgresión, pues una muda bestia de carga, hablando con voz humana, reprimió la locura del profeta.\n2Pe 2:17 Estos son manantiales sin agua, bruma impulsada por una tormenta, para quienes está reservada la oscuridad de las tinieblas.\n2Pe 2:18 Pues hablando con arrogancia y vanidad, seducen mediante deseos carnales, por sensualidad, a los que hace poco escaparon de los que viven en el error.\n2Pe 2:19 Les prometen libertad, mientras que ellos mismos son esclavos de la corrupción, pues uno es esclavo de aquello que lo ha vencido.\n2Pe 2:20 Porque si después de haber escapado de las contaminaciones del mundo por el conocimiento de nuestro Señor y Salvador Jesucristo, de nuevo son enredados en ellas y vencidos, su condición postrera viene a ser peor que la primera.\n2Pe 2:21 Pues hubiera sido mejor para ellos no haber conocido el camino de la justicia, que habiéndolo conocido, apartarse del santo mandamiento que les fue dado.\n2Pe 2:22 Les ha sucedido a ellos según el proverbio verdadero: «EL PERRO VUELVE A SU PROPIO VÓMITO», y: «La puerca lavada, vuelve a revolcarse en el cieno».\nThe Day of the Lord Will Come# 2Pe 3:1 Amados , esta es ya la segunda carta que les escribo, en las cuales, como recordatorio, despierto en ustedes su sincero entendimiento,\n2Pe 3:2 para que recuerden las palabras dichas de antemano por los santos profetas, y el mandamiento del Señor y Salvador declarado por los apóstoles de ustedes.\n2Pe 3:3 Ante todo, sepan esto: que en los últimos días vendrán burladores con su sarcasmo, siguiendo sus propias pasiones,\n2Pe 3:4 y diciendo: «¿Dónde está la promesa de Su venida? Porque desde que los padres durmieron, todo continúa tal como estaba desde el principio de la creación».\n2Pe 3:5 Pues cuando dicen esto, no se dan cuenta de que los cielos existían desde hace mucho tiempo, y también la tierra, surgida del agua y establecida entre las aguas por la palabra de Dios,\n2Pe 3:6 por lo cual el mundo de entonces fue destruido, siendo inundado por el agua.\n2Pe 3:7 Pero los cielos y la tierra actuales están reservados por Su palabra para el fuego, guardados para el día del juicio y de la destrucción de los impíos.\n2Pe 3:8 Pero, amados, no ignoren esto: que para el Señor un día es como mil años, y mil años como un día.\n2Pe 3:9 El Señor no se tarda en cumplir Su promesa, según algunos entienden la tardanza, sino que es paciente para con ustedes, no queriendo que nadie perezca, sino que todos vengan al arrepentimiento.\n2Pe 3:10 Pero el día del Señor vendrá como ladrón, en el cual los cielos pasarán con gran estruendo, y los elementos serán destruidos con fuego intenso, y la tierra y las obras que hay en ella serán quemadas.\n2Pe 3:11 Puesto que todas estas cosas han de ser destruidas de esta manera, ¡qué clase de personas no deben ser ustedes en santa conducta y en piedad,\n2Pe 3:12 esperando y apresurando la venida del día de Dios, en el cual los cielos serán destruidos por fuego y los elementos se fundirán con intenso calor!\n2Pe 3:13 Pero, según Su promesa, nosotros esperamos nuevos cielos y nueva tierra, en los cuales mora la justicia.\nFinal Words# 2Pe 3:14 Por tanto, amados, puesto que ustedes aguardan estas cosas, procuren con diligencia ser hallados por Él en paz, sin mancha e irreprensibles.\n2Pe 3:15 Consideren la paciencia de nuestro Señor como salvación, tal como les escribió también nuestro amado hermano Pablo, según la sabiduría que le fue dada.\n2Pe 3:16 Asimismo en todas sus cartas habla en ellas de esto; en las cuales hay algunas cosas difíciles de entender, que los ignorantes e inestables tuercen, como también tuercen el resto de las Escrituras, para su propia perdición.\n2Pe 3:17 Por tanto, amados, sabiendo esto de antemano, estén en guardia, no sea que arrastrados por el error de hombres libertinos, caigan de su firmeza.\n2Pe 3:18 Antes bien, crezcan en la gracia y el conocimiento de nuestro Señor y Salvador Jesucristo. A Él sea la gloria ahora y hasta el día de la eternidad.

Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,\n2Ti 2:18 men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.\n2Ti 2:19 Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, \u0026ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.\u0026rdquo;\n2Ti 2:20 Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.\n2Ti 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.\n2Ti 2:22 Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.\n2Ti 2:23 But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.\n2Ti 2:24 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,\n2Ti 2:25 with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,\n2Ti 2:26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.\nGodlessness in the Last Days# 2Ti 3:1 But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.\n2Ti 3:2 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,\n2Ti 3:3 unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,\n2Ti 3:4 treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,\n2Ti 3:5 holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.\n2Ti 3:6 For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,\n2Ti 3:7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\n2Ti 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.\n2Ti 3:9 But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes\u0026rsquo;s and Jambres\u0026rsquo;s folly was also.\nAll Scripture Is Breathed Out by God# 2Ti 3:10 Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,\n2Ti 3:11 persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!\n2Ti 3:12 Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\n2Ti 3:13 But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.\n2Ti 3:14 You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,\n2Ti 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n2Ti 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;\n2Ti 3:17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\nPreach the Word# 2Ti 4:1 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:\n2Ti 4:2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.\n2Ti 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,\n2Ti 4:4 and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.\n2Ti 4:5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.\n2Ti 4:6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.\n2Ti 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;\n2Ti 4:8 in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. Personal Instructions\n2Ti 4:9 Make every effort to come to me soon;\n2Ti 4:10 for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.\n2Ti 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.\n2Ti 4:12 But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.\n2Ti 4:13 When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.\n2Ti 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.\n2Ti 4:15 Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.\n2Ti 4:16 At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.\n2Ti 4:17 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n2Ti 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\nFinal Greetings# 2Ti 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.\n2Ti 4:20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.\n2Ti 4:21 Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.\n2Ti 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.\n—— 2 Timothy\nPaul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus, To Timothy, my beloved son: Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.\nI thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day, longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy. For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well.\nFor this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from all eternity, but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher. For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day. Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus. Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.\nYou are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains; but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me— the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.\nYou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier. Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules. The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel, for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned. For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory. It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him; If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us; If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself. Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness, and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some. Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, \u0026ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.\u0026rdquo; Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work. Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels. The Lord\u0026rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will. But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these. For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith. But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes\u0026rsquo;s and Jambres\u0026rsquo;s folly was also. Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance, persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me! Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work. I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom: preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths. But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. Personal Instructions Make every effort to come to me soon; for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments. Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching. At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them. But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion\u0026rsquo;s mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.

for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.\n2Ti 1:13 Retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.\n2Ti 1:14 Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.\n2Ti 1:15 You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.\n2Ti 1:16 The Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;\n2Ti 1:17 but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me—\n2Ti 1:18 the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.\n2Ti 2:1 You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.\n2Ti 2:2 The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.\n2Ti 2:3 Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.\n2Ti 2:4 No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him as a soldier.\n2Ti 2:5 Also if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not win the prize unless he competes according to the rules.\n2Ti 2:6 The hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.\n2Ti 2:7 Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.\n2Ti 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,\n2Ti 2:9 for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.\n2Ti 2:10 For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.\n2Ti 2:11 It is a trustworthy statement: For if we died with Him, we will also live with Him;\n2Ti 2:12 If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He also will deny us;\n2Ti 2:13 If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.\n2Ti 2:14 Remind them of these things, and solemnly charge them in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.\n2Ti 2:15 Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.\n2Ti 2:16 But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,\n2Ti 2:17 and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,\n2Ti 2:18 men who have gone astray from the truth saying that the resurrection has already taken place, and they upset the faith of some.\n2Ti 2:19 Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, \u0026ldquo;The Lord knows those who are His,\u0026rdquo; and, \u0026ldquo;Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to abstain from wickedness.\u0026rdquo;\n2Ti 2:20 Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and of earthenware, and some to honor and some to dishonor.\n2Ti 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.\n2Ti 2:22 Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.\n2Ti 2:23 But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.\n2Ti 2:24 The Lord\u0026rsquo;s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged,\n2Ti 2:25 with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,\n2Ti 2:26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.\n2Ti 3:1 But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come.\n2Ti 3:2 For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,\n2Ti 3:3 unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,\n2Ti 3:4 treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,\n2Ti 3:5 holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.\n2Ti 3:6 For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,\n2Ti 3:7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.\n2Ti 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith.\n2Ti 3:9 But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes\u0026rsquo;s and Jambres\u0026rsquo;s folly was also.\n2Ti 3:10 Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,\n2Ti 3:11 persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium and at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!\n2Ti 3:12 Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.\n2Ti 3:13 But evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.\n2Ti 3:14 You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,\n2Ti 3:15 and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n2Ti 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;\n2Ti 3:17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.\n2Ti 4:1 I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:\n2Ti 4:2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with great patience and instruction.\n2Ti 4:3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their own desires,\n2Ti 4:4 and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to myths.\n2Ti 4:5 But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.\n2Ti 4:6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.\n2Ti 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;\n2Ti 4:8 in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing. Personal Instructions\n2Ti 4:9 Make every effort to come to me soon;\n2Ti 4:10 for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.\n2Ti 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Pick up Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.\n2Ti 4:12 But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.\n2Ti 4:13 When you come bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.\n2Ti 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.\n2Ti 4:15 Be on guard against him yourself, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.\n2Ti 4:16 At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.\n2Ti 4:17 But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lion\u0026rsquo;s mouth.\n2Ti 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.\n2Ti 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.\n2Ti 4:20 Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.\n2Ti 4:21 Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.\n2Ti 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.\n"},{

      "content":"5 Principios para desenmascarar una cosmovisión no-biblica# Estos cinco principios han sido sugeridos por Nancy Pearcey en su libro \u0026ldquo;El Hallazgo de la verdad\u0026rdquo;. Nosotros meramente los vamos a resumir para aprenderlas y ponerlas en práctica.\nPrincipio #1: Identificar el ídolo# El lugar de partida es identificar el ídolo adorado en lugar de Dios. Algunos ejemplos de ídolos comunes incluyen la razón, la ciencia y la autonomía humana. Pearcey escribe,\nLa historia de la filosofía es en gran parte una historia de creación de sustitutos de Dios. Es una historia de creación de ídolos. Entonces, una de las formas más efectivas de entender la historia es identificar los ídolos predominantes. Como escribe Timothy Keller: “Toda personalidad humana, comunidad, forma de pensamiento y cultura se basará en alguna preocupación fundamental o lealtad fundamental, ya sea a Dios o a algún sustituto de Dios”. Por lo tanto, “La mejor manera de analizar las culturas es identificando sus ídolos corporativos”.\n“La mejor manera de analizar culturas es identificando sus ídolos corporativos”. —Timothy Keller Dado que Dios creó y gobierna todo, solo una cosmovisión que lo tenga en cuenta explicará con precisión las complejidades de la vida y el universo; en el mejor de los casos, los ídolos presentarán una versión distorsionada y drásticamente incompleta de la realidad.\nPearcey describe el fracaso de las visiones del mundo basadas en ídolos como tratar de encajar todo el universo perfectamente en una caja; inevitablemente, mucho no cabe en la caja.\nPrincipio #2: Identificar el reduccionismo del ídolo# Dado que ninguna cosmovisión falsa puede explicar todo satisfactoriamente (no cabe en la caja), se deben tomar atajos y la verdadera naturaleza de la existencia se \u0026ldquo;reduce\u0026rdquo; drásticamente en cada cosmovisión.\nEn lugar de una humanidad creada a imagen de Dios con valor y dignidad inherentes, los ídolos refunden al hombre a su propia imagen, siempre reduciendo la dignidad que Dios nos ha dado.\nEl materialismo es una cosmovisión favorita de Pearcey, quizás porque es muy fácil de desmantelar:\nRecuérdese que en el materialismo, el ídolo es materia. Todo lo demás se reduce a objetos materiales producidos por fuerzas materiales. Todo lo que no encaja en la caja materialista se descarta como una ilusión, incluidos el espíritu, el alma, la voluntad, la mente y la conciencia. Podríamos decir que el ser humano se redefine a imagen de la materia. Son despojados de sus cualidades humanas únicas y reducidos a máquinas bioquímicas, sin libre albedrío, determinadas por fuerzas naturales.\nSolo una cosmovisión bíblica puede explicar completamente la vida y permitirnos apreciar el mundo hermoso y complejo que Dios ha creado.\nPrincipio #3: Pon a prueba el ídolo: ¿contradice lo que sabemos sobre el mundo?# Cuando insistimos en otras visiones del mundo para ver cómo funcionan en el mundo real, se expondrán las fallas. Lo que no quepa en la caja se asomará y será visible para todos.\n¿Qué hacen los materialistas cuando se dan cuenta de que su cuadro de visión del mundo es demasiado pequeño para encajar en la evidencia? [es decir. negando el espíritu, el alma, la voluntad, la mente, la conciencia.] Suprimen la evidencia, tal como dice Pablo en Romanos 1.\nUna de las fortalezas de los escritos de Pearcey en Finding Truth y su trabajo anterior Total Truth es la amplitud de poderosas citas y ejemplos que muestran cómo los creyentes en visiones falsas del mundo admiten sus debilidades.\nDallas Willard comenta: “Me he dado cuenta de que los posmodernistas más enfáticos se vuelven fríamente modernos cuando discuten sus beneficios adicionales u otros asuntos que marcan una gran diferencia en su vida práctica”.\n(Aquí es cuando el emperador comienza a sospechar que no tiene ropa puesta).\nPrincipio #4: Pon a prueba el ídolo: ¿Se contradice a sí mismo?# Las contradicciones de las visiones del mundo basadas en ídolos no se limitan a lo que sabemos sobre el mundo, sino que se refuta a sí mismo.\nLos materialistas\u0026hellip; niegan la realidad de la mente (mientras usan sus mentes para promover el materialismo), los deterministas niegan la realidad de la elección humana (mientras eligen el determinismo), y los relativistas niegan el hecho de lo correcto y lo incorrecto (mientras te juzgan si no estás de acuerdo) .\nJohn Passmore dice que no se puede “mantener, como una verdad filosófica eterna, que no hay verdades filosóficas eternas”.\nDebido a que vivimos en un mundo creado y ordenado por Dios, cualquier otra explicación de la realidad carece en gran medida de sustancia y consistencia, y tiene consecuencias no intencionales (como se ve en la cita a continuación).\nEl impulso por la diversidad [entre muchos secularistas], que se suponía que era la salvaguardia de la libertad, se ha vuelto coercitivo y homogeneizador. La diversidad se ha convertido en una palabra clave para una nueva forma de tiranía.\nPrincipio #5: Reemplazar el ídolo: defender el cristianismo# El emperador solo pensará en ponerse ropa cuando se dé cuenta de que está desnudo. Lo mismo suele ocurrir con las cosmovisiones: solo podemos construir verdaderamente una nueva cosmovisión cuando la anterior ha sido arrasada.\nLos ateos a menudo denuncian el cristianismo como duro y negativo. Pero en realidad ofrece una visión mucho más positiva de la persona humana que cualquier religión o visión del mundo competidora. Es tan atractivo que los seguidores de otras visiones del mundo siguen descargando las partes que más les gustan.\n[Nosotros] a menudo escuchamos estereotipos de que el cristianismo es negativo y represivo; que considera la naturaleza humana como corrupta y sin valor; que le da poco valor a la vida en este mundo. Pero en realidad, la cosmovisión cristiana tiene una visión mucho más elevada de la vida humana que una\n"},{

Salmo 86:11-12# La Biblia sí enseña adoración\u0026hellip;# Encontramos varias palabras traducidas como \u0026lsquo;adorar\u0026rsquo; al español# Adorar en el Antiguo Testamento# שָׁחָה [shachah] - Una raíz primitiva; hacer bajar, es decir, postrarse (especialmente reflexivamente en homenaje a la realeza o a Dios): - inclinarse (auto) hacia abajo, agacharse, caer (aplanarse), suplicar humildemente, hacer (hacer) reverencia, hacer reverencia, inclinarse, adorar.# Adorar en el Nuevo Testamento# προσκυνέω [proskuneō] - hacer reverencia u homenaje besando la mano; en el NT hacer reverencia u homenaje mediante la postración,# λατρεύω [latreuō] - ser siervo, servir, rendir servicio religioso y homenaje, adoración, ofrecer sacrificios, presentar ofrendas.# Iremos paso a paso# Buscar la definición de adoración en el lexico y observar todas las veces que aparece en la Biblia probablemente no le dará una comprensión cabal de lo que es.# Por eso, en este estudio nos tomaremos unos pasos hacia atras para dar una mirada más amplia y así llegar a una mejor comprensión de la adoración como lo muestra la Biblia.# A todos nos gusta una buena historia\u0026hellip;# Para que una historia sea buena, requiere mínimamente de 3 elementos básicos\u0026hellip;# 1.

      "content":"Angels# When were angels created?# For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things have been created through Him and fo Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. Gen 2:1\nAngels were created by God. The question is when?\nMy contention is that the angels had to be created during the six days although the Bible doesn\u0026rsquo;t say explicitly which day.\n\u0026ldquo;For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy. Ex 20:11\nLucifer is said to have been created on a day\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you. Ezekiel 28:15\nTo say the angels were created before the six says clearly goes directly against Exodus 20:11.\n\u0026ldquo;For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.\nThe whole point of resting on day 7 (a literal day) is because God created everything in heaven and on earth in six literal days.\nbut the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. Exodus 20:10\nThe verse that people use to say angels were already created before day one is in Job 38.\n\u0026ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding, who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the line on it? \u0026ldquo;On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy? Job 38:4-7\nThe foundation of the earth could be understood as the whole week of creation as Genesis 2 concludes the earth was created in a day (a period of time).\nThis is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven. Gen 2:4\nThe foundation of the earth could easily refer to a period of time not the specific forming of the earth\u0026rsquo;s matter on day one or the appearing of dry land on day three.\nThen God said, \u0026ldquo;Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear\u0026rdquo;; and it was so. Genesis 1:9\nThe Job passage could be a reference to the angels observing the appearing of dry land on day three or seeing the creation of the earth\u0026rsquo;s matter in day one. Either would fit perfectly.\nIt would seem best to conclude that angels were created on or after day one but no later than day three with the appearing of dry land.\nWhen did the angels fall?# First off, at least Lucifer still has access to heaven. He will not be prohibited all access until during the Tribulation. But, when did the angels rebel against God? Was it before man sinned? Was it after or was at the same point in time?\nOne thing to keep in mind is that death came into the world when Adam sinned not when Lucifer rebelled. There was not death before Adam\u0026rsquo;s sin.\n"},{

This road stretched from Egypt in the south to Babylon in Mesopotamia, linking the major empires and trade routes of the day. Megiddo\u0026rsquo;s position on this highway made it a prime mercantile city. Whoever controlled Megiddo controlled access to trade all along this road. Megiddo was a choke point, therefore, for the empires of the ancient world. Control of Megiddo was crucial to controlling any regional empire. 1\nMegiddo as a city went into decline during the Babylonian and Persian periods. However, in modern times the site continued to see battles. Both Napoleon (1799) and the British General Allenby (1918) defeated Turkish forces here. The area has never lost its significance as a battleground for control over this crucial crossroad of empires.1\nRev 16:14 for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.\nRev 16:15 (\u0026ldquo;Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the one who stays awake and keeps his clothes, so that he will not walk about naked and men will not see his shame.\u0026rdquo;)\nRev 16:16 And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Har-Magedon.\nIt is the sixth bowl that deals with the gathering of forces at Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared. And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty\u0026hellip; And they gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon\u0026rdquo; (verses 12-14, 16).1\nArmageddon is a place# Ezekiel 39:2 (NAS95)# 2 and I will turn you around, drive you on, take you up from the remotest parts of the north and bring you against the mountains of Israel.\nArmageddon is a battle# This will be the culminating event of the Day of the Lord.\n\u0026ldquo;battle of that great day of God Almighty.\u0026rdquo; Revelation 16:14\nZechariah 14:1-3 (NAS95)# 1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.\n2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.\n3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.\nEzekiel 38:15 (NAS95)# 15 \u0026ldquo;You will come from your place out of the remote parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great assembly and a mighty army;\nArmageddon is an event\nIs Zechariah 6:1-8 talking about Armageddon?# Zec 6:1 Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.\nZechariah 1:8 in a ravine - two mountain implied?\nbronze NECHOSHETH: Deuteronomy 8:9 a land where you will eat food without scarcity, in which you will not lack anything; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper (NECHOSHETH).

Other scriptures tell us this is not the actual place of the battle. That takes place in Jerusalem, several miles to the south. The broad flat plains of the Jezreel Valley are only the staging area for this climatic confrontation.1\nJoel 3:9-12, 3:2\nJer 50:9 \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to arouse and bring up against Babylon A horde of great nations from the land of the north, And they will draw up their battle lines against her; From there she will be taken captive.

      "content":"Biblical Convenants# Establishing a preliminary understanding# In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the biblical covenants, we will take a step back and see the general usage and importance of the term \u0026ldquo;covenant\u0026rdquo;.# Although we have many external sources (i.e. dictionaries, archaeological data, lexicons, historical records) that help us acquire a better understanding, we will not go to those first.# 2. A Scriptural principle: If the topic is to be considered important within the teaching of Scripture, the Bible will provide us sufficient usage and background to gain a sufficient understanding of that particular topic.# B. Establishing the importance of the word Covenant# 1. The word covenant shows up 281 times in the Old Testament (BERITH - Hebrew) and 33 times in the New Testament (DIATHEKE - Greek). This word appears all the way from Genesis to Revelation.# a. In the Old Testament (BERITH): 27 times in Genesis, 13 times in Exodus, 10 times in Leviticus, 5 times in Numbers, 27 times in Deuteronomy, 22 Times in Joshua, 5 times in Judges, 14 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Samuel, 26 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Kings, 30 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Chronicles, 1 time in Ezra, 4 times in Nehemiah, 3 times in Job, 21 times in Psalms, 1 time in proverbs, 12 times in Isaiah, 24 times in Jeremiah, 18 times in Ezekiel, 7 times in Daniel, 5 times in Hosea, 1 time in Amos, 1 time in Obadiah, 2 times in Zechariah and 6 times in Malachi.# b. In the New Testament (DIATHEKE): 1 time in Matthew, 1 time in Mark, 2 times in Luke, 2 times in Acts, 1 time in Romans, 3 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Corinthians, 2 times in Galatians, 21 times in Hebrews and 1 time in Revelation.# 1) Jesus is quoted using the term at least 5 times.# a) Though these quotes are referencing the same event, it is of interest that several different writers of the NT quote him speaking of a covenant, it gives us a clue it must be an important topic.# c. These and many observations more warrant a deeper study on the word covenant and its meaning.# C. Establishing the meaning of the word covenant# 1. What is the first Scriptural mention of the word?# a. The first appearance of the word is in Genesis (Gen 6:18)# 1) God initiates and promises Noah he will establish (ratify) a “covenant” with him# 2) God promises it here but it is not Ratified until after the flood and its fulfillment is ongoing# a) ‘A new beginning’ (compare Gen 9:3 and Gen 1:29-30)# 3) God’s promises to Noah, his descendants and to all flesh (Gen 9:9ff)# a) No negotiations took place# b) Universal# c) Unconditional# d) Had a sign (rainbow) to remind God of his promise to all flesh# e) everlasting# 4) The Noahic covenant sets a pattern for other covenants# a) God first makes a promise to someone of establishing a covenant.# b) This is conditioned upon a response of faith.# c) God then establishes the terms of the covenant and ratifies it.# d) Though the covenant goes into effect immediately, the fulfillment of the covenant may be postponed.# 2. Usage of the word - we see the term used in a great deal of ways.# a. Covenants among men# 1) Abimelech and Isaac (Gen 26:26-31)# 2) Joshua and the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:15)# a) God had said not to make covenants with the land (Deut 7:2, Judg 2:2)# 3) Solomon and Hiram (1 Kings 5:12)# 4) David and Jonathan (1 Samuel 20:3, 1 Samuel 20:16-17)# 5) Marriage (Mal 2:14)# 6) Threshold covenant# a) The threshold seems to be the separation of a dwelling from the outside world.# b) It was an insult to set something on the threshold (1 Sam 5:4-5)# c) God has made Jerusalem his threshold (translated cup) therefore is indignant of those trampling on her (Zech 1:9)# 7) Antichrist will make a covenant with ‘the many’ (Dan 9:27, 2 Thess. 2:3-4, Matt 24:15)# a) Daniel 9:27 - The tribulation begins with a ‘deal with the many for 7 years’ and ends in complete destruction# i) 7 years long\nii) Firm (with many). This covenant is made by him and broken when he changes his mind. He shows no regard for covenant keeping.\niii) Within 42 months, temple service is stopped (abomination of desolation) by him\nb. God makes covenants with people# 1) The purpose of this study is mostly concerned with this aspect of these covenants.# a) God’s covenant with Adam (part 1) - Hosea 6:7 - Possibly Adam here should be translated men, however by implication it does seem that a relationship of trust was set up originally . The word covenant does not appear in Genesis 1-3 but does not mean God did not set up a conditional agreement in the beginning, that is clear. (Gen 1:26-30).# b) God’s covenant with Adam (part 2)# i) This would refer to a covenant set up with Adam.\nc) God’s covenant to Cain (Gen 4:15)# d) God’s covenant with Noah, his descendants and all flesh (Gen 9:9-17)# e) God’s covenant with Abram (Gen 12:1-3, 15:18-21, 17:2-21)# i) God’s covenant with Isaac (Gen 26:3)\nii) God’s covenant with Jacob (Gen 28:13)\nf) God’s covenant with Moses for Israel (Ex 24:3-8)# g) God’s covenant with Aaron (Ex. 40:12-15, Num 25:12-13, Neh 13:29)# h) God’s covenant with David to his family (2 Sam 7:11-16, Psa 89:3, Jer 33:21, 2 Chr 13:5)# i) God’s new (renewed) covenant with Israel and Judah (Hos 2:18-23, Jer 31:31-34)# c. Types of Covenants# 1) Blood covenants# a) Blood covenants were made by two parties. Both cut up animals and walked between them saying “If I do not hold to the agreements of this covenant, you can do to me what we did to this animal.” - Jer 34:18-20.# b) Although we often see blood associated with covenants, we must not presume all covenants in the Bible are sealed in blood.# c) Hebrews 13:20 - The covenant(s) and the blood of Christ cannot be ignored# i) Noah sacrificed animals before God made the covenant (Gen 8:20)\n(a) God walked though a cut of blood to covenant with Abraham\nThe Mosaic covenant was in blood (Ex. 24:8, Heb 9:19-20)\n(b) New covenant was in blood (Matt 26:28, Mar 14:24, Luk 22:20, Heb 10:29, 12:24, 13:20)\n2) Bilateral or Conditional covenants# a) covenants are usually made between two parties. In a bilateral covenant, each party agrees to upholding a certain set of conditions.# 3) Unilateral or Unconditional covenants# a) A unilateral covenant is where one party guarantees carrying out both the responsibilities and results of the arrangement.# 4) Marriage covenant# a) Marriage (as instituted by God) is unique. Two unilateral parties (one man, one woman) enter a covenant before God in unconditional agreement with each other until death. The only possible conditions for the covenant to be dissolved is by adultery or abandonment (unbeliever).# 5) Covenant of Salt - “equivalent to an indissoluble covenant, or inviolable contract” - Keil \u0026amp; Delitzsch# 6) Definition of the word covenant# a) The Hebrew term BERIYTH for \u0026ldquo;covenant\u0026rdquo; is from a root with the sense of \u0026ldquo;cutting\u0026rdquo;, because pacts or covenants were made by passing between cut pieces of flesh of the victim of an animal sacrifice. - Wikipedia# b) The Greek word for covenant is DIATHEKE which means a disposition, arrangement, of any sort, which one wishes to be valid, the last disposition which one makes of his earthly possessions after his death, a testament or will.# d. Summarizing Types of Covenants as agreements# 1) International treaties (Joshua 9:6, 1 Kings 15:19)# 2) Clan alliances (Gen 14:13)# 3) Personal agreements (Gen 31:44)# 4) Legal contracts (Jer 34:8-10)# 5) Loyalty agreements (1 Sam 20:14-17)# 6) Marriage (Mal 2:14)# 7) Other terms used for Covenants# a) Covenant as promise - although God makes promises, covenants are usually more involved than a simple promise.# b) Covenant as grace or redemption - divine covenants are sometimes soteriological in nature but not every time and not by definition. While the most important thing is God’s plan of redemption (especially to me as an individual) it is not everything God is doing. He has many things happening at once.# c) Covenant as administration or relational - this is to see the covenants from a theological interpretive nature# d) Covenant as vassal treaty or land grant - the problem with this view is that God’s covenants are seen as being based on this understanding rather than the vassal treaty arrangement having an origin and beginning from God’s dealings with man. God certainly uses means to relate with man in terms he can understand but His relation is not on the basis of human understanding but rather on His the basis of His character.# e. Based on the Scriptural usage of the word in international treaties, clan alliances, personal agreements, legal contracts and loyalty agreements, the types of covenants, and the meaning of the original words, we define a biblical covenant as an agreement or binding alliance between two parties, establishing a relationship of trust. The nature of a covenant is explained within itself. Usually they are a solemn, unbreakable, never-ending bond.# D. Building an understanding from the Biblical usage of covenants# 1. Care must be taken to build a theological understanding from the teaching of Scripture, not the other way around. This is especially true in regards to the divine covenants.# a. God’s plan of the ages can be understood through covenants He has made with man# 1) The divine covenants do not go against any of God’s attributes# 2) The divine covenants reveal the purposes and relationship between God and man, particularly in regards to His chosen nation, Israel# 2. Different theological systems regarding covenants# a. 2 Covenants/ 3 Covenants - Covenant Theology# 1) Covenant of works vs covenant of grace + covenant of redemption# 2) Covenant of works is before the fall of man when God gives him duties to fulfill# 3) Understands biblical covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic etc. Etc. ) within covenant of grace# 4) Church starts at Adam -\u0026gt; Israel -\u0026gt; today# 5) The covenant theologian indirectly admits this theology is not taught in Scripture but is necessary to ‘understand’ Scripture\u0026hellip;# \u0026hellip;that only (historic) Reformed theology provides the system of doctrine necessary for an exposition of the divine covenants which is faithful to the teaching of Scripture. Karlberg, “Covenant Theology” p. 11.\nb. 5 Covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)# c. 7 Covenants (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Land, Mosaic, Davidic, New)# d. 8 Covenants (Adamic, Adamic (post fall) Noahic, Abrahamic, Land, Mosaic, Davidic, New)# II. God made covenants with man# A. A word concerning God’s covenant program# 1. Throughout history we notice how God initiates agreements with people to establish a relational dynamic. This is true before the fall, it is true after the fall when all is broken and eventually the relationship with man will be fully restored through Jesus Christ.# 2. God’s covenant program can be traced back to the Abrahamic covenant (Gen 12:1-3) and further clarification is given in Genesis 13:14-17 and Genesis 17:1-8. This covenant was codified in Genesis 15.# 3. A general order of practice can be seen the covenants God makes with man. First, God promises the covenant, then God ratifies the covenant and finally God fulfills the covenant.# Promised Inaugurated/Ratified Observance/Fulfillment Noahic Gen 6:18 Gen 9:9 Gen 9:11 Abrahamic Gen 12 Gen 15 Kingdom of God Mosaic Ex. 6:4 Ex. 24:8 Mat 5:17 New Covenant Jer 31 Luke 22:20 Jer 31:34 Kingdom of God # B. Adamic (Edenic) Covenant - Before the fall (Hosea 6:7, Gen 1:26-30, 2:15-25)# 1. God evidently made a covenant with Adam in the garden. Hosea 6:7# a. God made a conditional covenant with Adam (Gen 1:18, 2:16- 17)# 1) Adam was to care for the garden and the animals. (Gen 1:26, 28)# 2) Adam was to multiply and be fruitful. (Gen 1:28)# 3) Adam was not to take from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (Gen 2:17)# b. Some would say “Adam” in Hosea 6:7 refers to men in general?# 1) God did not make a covenant with men in general# 2) Probably not since the breaking of the covenant would have to refer to Adam not mankind for this verse to make sense. Israel would have to understand ‘the covenant’ that Adam would have broken. (Joel 31:33)# C. God’s Covenant to Noah (Gen 8:15-9:17)# 1. Genesis 6:18 - \u0026ldquo;But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife, and your sons\u0026rsquo; wives with you. This is the first use of the word covenant (BERITH) .# 2. Universal - To Noah, his descendants and all flesh (Gen 9:11)# 3. Sign of the covenant is the rainbow (Gen 9:12-17)# a. The idea of an outward sign in connection with a covenant is established# 4. Duration: Forever (Gen 9:16)# 5. Commands of the covenant# a. Be fruitful and multiply (Gen 9:1, 7)# b. No eating blood (Gen 9:3-4)# c. Men must govern - life is sacred, capital punishment (Gen 9:5-6)# 6. The promises contained in the covenant# a. God will never destroy every living thing (Gen 8:21-22)# b. The animal kingdom will fear man (Gen 9:2)# c. Man has right to eat meat (Gen 9:3)# d. There will never be a world-wide flood to destroy the earth (Gen 9:11, 15)# 7. Conditions of the covenant - unconditional# # D. God’s Covenant to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3, 13:14-18, 15:1-21, 17:1-27, 1 Chr 18:3, 2 Chr 9:25-26, Acts 3:12-26, Rom 4, Gal 3:1-18)# 1. As we study the covenants God makes with people, we see the covenants interconnected and God has a certain plan in mind. He chooses individuals for the purpose of furthering that program.# a. Noah lived 950 years. In Genesis 10-11 we’re told how man quickly became corrupted after the flood. Babel (in Shinar) is the narrative of how mankind as one nation and language became corrupted and idolatrous.# b. Not long before Noah dies, God calls Abram out of Ur (in the land of Shinar), out his culture, his people, his former heritage and pagan life to a place God had for him.# 1) The promise of a land was conditioned on Abram’s faith in God.# c. Understanding the connection between Noah and Abraham# 1) Soon after Noah and his family get off the ark, we see that evidently sin did not get destroyed in the flood. (Genesis 9:18-29). It it in this account that we also see how Shem is chosen in connection to God’s blessing and Canaan (Ham’s descendant) is cursed. Noah’s blessings and curses should probably be understood as prophetic.# a) Genesis 9:24 - When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. When Noah woke up from his drunken stupor he deals with his sons who got involved.# b) Genesis 9:25 - So he said, \u0026ldquo;Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers.\u0026rdquo; Noah curses Ham’s son (and the Canaanites) for his sinful response to Noah’s drunkenness.# c) Genesis 9:26 - He also said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. God receives blessing and glory for Shem’s actions. Canaan would be his servant.# d) Abraham is a descendant of Shem, the line of blessing (Gen 11:10-26)# (ii) Moses gives this account to Israel after they have left Egypt as background to God’s sovereign choice of Israel as His nation. Israel was to serve as a vessel for God to show his glory and light unto the nations. They needed to understand God had given them the land of Canaan and take it by faith because God had given it to them.\n2. The initial promise to Abram is found in Genesis 12:1-3# a. In a similar fashion as God did with Noah, God promises to establish a covenant with him in the future. Like Noah, Abraham would have to trust God and move forward knowing that following his move to a foreign land God would establish his covenant with him.# b. Genesis 12:1 - Now the LORD said to Abram, \u0026ldquo;Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father\u0026rsquo;s house, To the land which I will show you; Abram needed to leave his home and go to a land where God wanted for this promise to be enacted. This reminds us of Noah who had to build and ark and trust God through the flood before God made a covenant with him. Once the covenant was made it was not conditioned in any way on Abraham’s part.# c. Genesis 12:2 - And I will make you a great nation. Abraham would be made by God into a great nation.# d. Genesis 12:2b - And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing. He would be blessed by God and become a blessing to others. God’s blessings are so we can bless others.# e. Genesis 12:3a - And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. Blessings and curses would come to nations that either blessed or cursed Israel.# f. Genesis 12:3b And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed. All the families or ethnic peoples of the earth would be blessed in him.# 3. The covenant contains 9 promises and can be summed up into 3.# a. The land (Gen 15:18-21)# b. The seed (Gen 22:17)# c. The blessing (Gen 22:17-18)# 4. General features of the Abrahamic covenant# a. Eternal (Gen 13:15, 17:7-8, 13, 19)# b. Unconditional (Gen 15:9-12, 17-18) God swore by himself (Heb 6:13)# c. Future fulfillment# 5. Literal historical fulfillment# 1) Abraham was blessed# a) Land (Gen 13:8, 14:22-23)# b) Servants (Gen 15:7)# c) Cattle (Gen 13:2, 24:34-35)# 2) Abraham had many offspring (Josh 24:3)# 3) Abraham became a great name (2Chr 20:7, Luk 1:73, Luk 13:28, Rom 4:3)# 4) Abraham has become a channel of blessing to all people groups (Gal 3:7-9)# 5) Historically nations have been blessed or cursed in direct relation to Israel# a) Edomites cursed for cursing Israel (Oba 1:2, 10, 12)# (iii) Future destruction promised (Obadiah 1:15)\nb) Abimelech blessed for blessing Israel (Gen 20:2-18)# c) Others (Deut 30:7, Isa 14:1-2, Joe 3:1-8, Matt 25:40-45)# 6) Abraham had an heir by Sarah (Gen 21:2)# 6. Literal Future Fulfillment# a. Israel’s sin and lack of keeping the Mosaic covenant did not annul the unconditional promises God made to Abraham’s descendants. (Gal 3:17)# b. Though many initial things were seen, the covenant was not fulfilled during Abraham’s life. He was looking ahead for its fulfillment (Heb 11:8-12, Jn 8:56).# c. It was not fulfilled before Jesus’ death (Matt 26:29, Luk 22:16, 18, 29-30)# d. Seed aspect: David’s throne (over Israel from Jerusalem) is currently exercising authority. Jesus Christ will be seated on the throne of David as king over Israel and the nations.# 1) Luke 22:69 \u0026ldquo;But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD.\u0026rdquo; Jesus is currently seated at the right hand of the Father’s throne.# a) The LORD says to my Lord: \u0026ldquo;Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.\u0026rdquo; Jesus was not seated at God’s right hand until after his ascension. (Heb 10:12) He will be seated there for a temporary period of time not eternally as was promised to David. (2 Sam 7:14, Heb 1:8)# 2) Revelation 3:21 - \u0026lsquo;He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. Jesus is currently seated at his Father’s throne. One day he will be seated on his throne.# 3) Isaiah 9:6 - For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. This is a reference of Jesus. A child is born is regarding his humanity. A son will be given has to do with his divinity. The government (rule of heaven and earth) will be upon his shoulders.# 4) Isaiah 9:7a - *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom\u0026hellip;*Jesus will reign on David’s throne (as descendent of David) and the duration of it will be forever.# e. The fullness of the gentiles has obviously not come in today. Gentiles are still getting saved. Therefore, God’s program will shift to work with Israel once again in the future (Rom 11:25).# f. The land boundary markers have not been fulfilled (Gen 15:18-21). The land was not given to Abraham but rather to his descendants.# 7. The Abrahamic covenant is further developed throughout the Old Testament# a. To Isaac (Gen 17:19, Gen 26:2-4)# b. To Jacob (Gen 28:13-15)# c. Land covenant (Deut. 30:1-10)# d. Davidic covenant (Seed) (2 Sam. 7:14-16)# e. New covenant (Blessing) (Jer. 31:31-34)# 8. Outward sign of the covenant (Gen 17:9-14)# a. Many covenants had an outward, earthly sign. The sign of the Abrahamic covenant was circumcision# E. Mosaic Covenant - God’s bilateral agreement with Israel (Ex 19-24, Deut 28:1-16, )# 1. God promises Moses to rescue Israel from oppression and give them a land flowing with milk and honey (the land of the Canaanites) at the burning bush incident (Ex 3:17)# 2. This covenant is between God and Israel, established at Mount Sinai (Ex 19:3-8)# a. Exodus 19:3a - Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, God’s instruction to Moses was to bring Israel to this point and get further instructions. (Ex 3:12)# b. Exodus 19:3b - saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel: This covenant is a bilateral agreement between Israel and God mediated through Moses.# c. Exodus 19:4 - \u0026lsquo;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles\u0026rsquo; wings, and brought you to Myself. By grace Israel had been brought out. God demonstrated his promise to Israel by rescuing her from Egypt. (Rom 9:15-17)# d. Exodus 19:5a - \u0026lsquo;Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant...the conditional aspect of this covenant is set forth from the beginning. The condition was if Israel fully obeyed God’s voice and kept his covenant.# e. Exodus 19:5b - then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; As Israel kept this covenant it would become evident among all the peoples that they were in fact his possession. God had already said they were brought out to himself. They were already chosen. This was an unconditional promise made to Abraham centuries before. Therefore, we conclude this was not about becoming God’s possession but rather walking before men reflecting who they already were.# f. Exodus 19:6a - and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Becoming a kingdom of priests and a holy nation was conditional upon keeping the Law. Under this theocratic kingdom, Israel would be a holy nation with priests. This refers to a literal, earthly fulfillment as stated by Moses in his last words in Deuteronomy 33:29 , “Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you, And you will tread upon their high places.” (Num 24:8, 17, Dan 7:27)# g. Exodus 19:6b-7 - These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel. So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him. Moses was the mediator between God and the people. And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD. (Ex 19:8b)# h. Exodus 19:8 - All the people answered together and said, \u0026ldquo;All that the LORD has spoken we will do!\u0026rdquo;. Israel was just miraculously delivered from slavery under the most powerful ruler on earth. They are excited to be free and will accept to do anything God asks. Little do they know, the Law is much too demanding and high a standard to be kept all of the time.# i. Exodus 20 - The Ten Commandments - the basic terms of the Mosaic Covenant# 1) The four first commands had to do with God their sovereign# a) To honor the one true God# b) Jesus sums these commands as \u0026lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.’ Matthew 22:37# 2) Six commands had to do with man# a) Respecting fellow man# b) Jesus sums up these commands as, \u0026lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.\u0026rsquo; Matthew 22:39# 3) It established a nation with its own constitution# a) Established national independence# b) Established moral code# c) Established relationships between Israel and God as sovereign and man as equal-rights bearers.# (i) Written with finger of God (Deut 4:13, Ex 31:18, 32:16)\n(ii) All 12 tribes of Israel accepted the terms\n4) Given to establish Israel’s national identity# 5) Given to keep in custody until Christ came (Gal 3:19, 23)# 6) Established God’s righteous standard to make known to humankind# 7) It was given for convicting of knowledge of sin (Rom 3:19, 5:20, Rom 7:7)# a) To lead to Christ# 3. The Mosaic Covenant was ratified in blood (Ex 24:1-8)# 4. Was given on a temporary basis (‘forever’ with conditions) (Deut 12:28)# a. God knew they would not keep it (Eze 20:25, Rom 7:10)# b. Though they promised they would to everything God said, they failed miserably (Deut 5:27-28, Jer 11:10). They were bound to fail since it was conditioned on man’s faithfulness and not God’s.# 5. This covenant was a bilateral agreement (Deut 5:28-29)# a. Conditioned upon Israel’s obedience# 1) Rewarded for keeping it - (Deut 11:26-28)# 2) Punished for disobeying - (Deut 11:26-28)# 6. Sign of the covenant is the Sabbath day (Ex. 31:12-18)# a. A national day of rest reflected God as their creator# b. Each individual person was to set aside the 7th day and remember God# 7. The Mosaic covenant was never given to justify anyone (Gal 3:11)# 8. Given 430 years after the Abrahamic Covenant (Gal 3:16-18)# a. Did not annul or add conditions to the Abraham covenant# F. ‘Land’ Covenant - (Deuteronomy 29-30, Ezekiel 16, 47:1-48:35)# 1. Sometimes this covenant is incorrectly referred to as the Palestinian covenant. Not only is this term not used in the Bible, this term was coined by a Roman emperor named Hadrian who prohibited Jews from entering Israel again and tried to wipe out the memory of Israel by calling the land after their enemies, the Philistines.# a. The Lord called it the land of Israel. (Matt 2:20, Gen 9:25-27)# b. Old Testament calls it the promised land (Gen 28:15, 50:24, Ex 12:25, Num 14:16, Deut 6:3, 9:28, 19:8, 27:3, Josh 23:5)# 1) Land flowing with milk and honey (Deut 6:3)# 2. Genesis 15:18-21 - On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, \u0026ldquo;To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates: the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.\u0026rdquo; The size of this land given to Abram is clearly stated. (Eze 47:15-20)# 3. Deuteronomy 29:1 - These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb...though Moses is involved in the making of this covenant, and it is also between God and Israel, clearly this covenant is not connected to the Mosaic Covenant (Deut 29:13).# 4. Deuteronomy 30:20 - \u0026hellip;for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them. This covenant is an expansion of the Abrahamic.# 5. There are 8 promises in this covenant. The land will eventually be given to Israel, yet the timing of fulfillment based on Israel’s spiritual return to the Lord (Deut 30:1-8)# a. Deuteronomy 30:1 - \u0026ldquo;So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you, First: Israel will disobey the Mosaic Covenant and be spread out around the world (Deut 29:2-30:1, Eze 16:35-52).# b. Deuteronomy 30:2 - and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons, Second: Israel will repent.# c. Deuteronomy 30:3 - then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, Third: The Messiah will come.# d. Deuteronomy 30:3b-4 - and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.\u0026ldquo;If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back. Fourth: Israel will be regathered.# 1) Since the scattering is literal (70AD), we must understand the regathering to also be literal.# e. Deuteronomy 30:5 - The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers. Fifth: Israel will possess the Promised Land (Eze 47:22).# f. Deuteronomy 30:6 - Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live. Sixth: Israel will be regenerated.# g. Deuteronomy 30:7 - The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. Seventh: the enemies of Israel will be judged.# h. Deuteronomy 30:8 - And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today. Eighth: Israel will receive full blessing; specifically, the blessings of the Messianic Age. (Deut 30:8-20)# 6. The importance of this covenant is that it affirms Israel’s title deed to the land# a. There are no ‘ifs’. It is unconditional based on the covenant made to Abraham.# 1) Since it is unconditional it is still in effect today# # G. God’s covenant to David and his House (2 Chr 7:18, 13:5, 21:7, 2 Sam 7:14, Jer 33:14-26, Psa 89:28-29, 33-34, 110:1, 132:11-18)# 1. The Davidic Covenant is an expansion to the seed (a great nation) aspect of the Abrahamic covenant.# 2. 2 Samuel 7:12-16 - About four hundred years after the covenant is given, David wanted to build God a house. In return however, God says he will allow David’s son to build him a temple and make David’s house and his throne last forever. (1 Chr 38:3, 5)# a. 2 Samuel 7:12 - \u0026ldquo;When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. God promises to raise up a descendant (singular) from David’s blood line and establish his kingdom. (Psa 132:11)# 1) Usually Bible prophecy contains a near and a far fulfillment# a) 1 Kings 1 narrates God working behind the scenes to secure the throne for Solomon, David’s son.# (i) The fulfillment of this near prophecy means God will fulfill the far prophecy.# (ii) Since Solomon literally sat on the literal throne of his father David, then it stands to reason the far prophecy must be literally fulfilled as well. Jesus Christ will sit on a literal, earthly throne from the city of Jerusalem. (Dan 7:13-14)# (iii) Some interpret David’s throne to be spiritual. However many verses refute this idea. The arguments given against the literal fulfillment are very often very simplistic and don’t cover the vast amount of passages covering the literal fulfillment of David’s throne. Here are some reasons why we cannot spiritualize this kingdom.# (a) Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream disagrees with a spiritual fulfillment. (Dan 2:2:44-45)\n(i) This 5th kingdom destroys the first 4 earthly kingdoms. Those who say Jesus is reigning on David’s throne right now, must also accept that the kingdoms of man were destroyed, yet clearly that is not the case. (Isa 9:7)\n(b) The throne mentioned in heaven is God’s, not David’s (Heb. 1:13; 8:1; 12:2; 1 Pet. 3:22, Dan 7:9,13, Mat 5:34, Mat 23:32, Rev 3:21, 5:7, 7:15, 12:5).\n(i) Psalm 132:13-17 For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation\u0026hellip;There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.\n(ii) At present, Jesus as high priest is interceding between the church and the throne of God and not fulfilling the Davidic covenant. (Rom 8:34; 1 Tim 2:5, Heb 4:16)\n(iii) God’s throne was set up in eternity past. David’s was not. (Psa 93:2)\n(c) David’s throne is directly connected with the nation of Israel (Jer 33:17, 21, Mat 19:28, Isa 2:1-4, Isa 24:23, Jer 23:5-6, Mic 4:1-5)\n(i) It would give them rest from their enemies (2 Sam 7:10-11)\n(ii) They would be regenerated (Jer 31:33)\n(iii) Jerusalem will be the center of the world (Zech 8:3)\n(d) Factors indicating the distinction between God’s throne and David’s throne:\n(i) Several descendants of David have sat on his throne, but only one descendant ever sits at the right hand of God’s throne in Heaven. (Psa 110:1; Heb 8:1; 12:2)\n(ii) David’s throne was not established before his lifetime but God’s throne exists eternally. (2 Sam 7:16-17, Psa 93:1-2)\nb. 2 Samuel 7:13 - \u0026ldquo;He shall build a house for My name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever\u0026hellip; This is in regarding Solomon building a house for God. (1 Chr 17:11-12) The throne aspect is what is forever, not Solomon. Solomon will actually be cut off from the Messianic line (Jer 22:30; 36:30).# c. 2 Samuel 7:14 - \u0026ldquo;I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, this is in reference to the long term aspect of the prophecy.# 1) Near fulfillment: Solomon committed iniquity (similar to Saul) yet God did not withdraw his promise made to David.# 2) Far fulfillment: Jesus did not commit iniquity, however he did identify and take on the sins of mankind, therefore God punished him using the rod and strokes of men. Christ did this in order to make the necessary payment for our sins. (Isa 53:6-10)# d. 2 Samuel 7:15 - but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. Though Solomon failed similarly to Saul, Christ would not have God’s lovingkindness removed from him. (Isa 53:11-12, 2 Tim 2:8, Rev 5:5)# e. 2 Samuel 7:16 - \u0026ldquo;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.\u0026rdquo; The term “house” refers to a dynasty – a family line of kings. God’s promise to David and his descendants is that his kingdom and royal family would always be on the throne. Just as David’s throne is literal, David’s houses’ throne will also be literal with the literal people of David, the Jews. (Psa 132:13-14, 2 Sam 22:51)# f. Genesis 3:15 - And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel.\u0026rdquo; This was the original mention of the promised seed.# 3. The fulfillment of the Davidic throne in the greater son of David – the Lord Jesus Christ# a. Matthew and Luke establish the genealogy of Jesus. They identify Jesus as the son of David. (Mat 1:1-17, Luk 3:23-31)# ​ i. Both legally and biologically, Jesus is related to David.\nb. The virgin Mary was told of her son who would be heir to the throne of David. (Luk 1:31-33)# 1) Luke 1:31 \u0026ldquo;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. She would bear a son and she would call him Jesus. (Gen 3:15)# c. Blind men knew Jesus was the Son of David. (Mat 9:27)# d. Luke 1:32 \u0026ldquo;He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; Gabriel’s announcement verifies Mary’s Son will be the fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant. Jesus, son of the most high, was also a descendant of David. God would give him David’s throne. God has not given him this throne yet. David’s Son must return to earth to rule on David’s throne. (Psa 110:1, Rev 3:21, Isa 9:6-7, Zech 14:9, Matt 22:42-44, Mat 25:31)# 1) David’s throne was earthly, political, and limited to Israel and not spiritual# e. Luke 1:33 and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.\u0026rdquo; Mary’s son would reign over Israel (the house of Jacob) his term as king would never end, his kingdom would be eternal.# 1) Christ has the key of David (Rev 3:7)# f. Revelation 22:3 - There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him; The new heavens and new earth once God has restored all things has Christ reigning forever and ever (Rev 22:5)# g. Revelation 22:16 - \u0026ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.\u0026rdquo; The root – He existed before David, speaks to the eternality of Christ.# 1) The offspring – He was born a descendant of David fulfilling the promise of an eternal king in the line of David.# h. Since the Davidic covenant is an expansion to the seed aspect of the Abrahamic covenant, it is unconditional in its fulfillment and will be in the millennial reign. (Rev 20:4, 22:16)# i. Understanding the Davidic Covenant means we know world peace will not come through social and political activity of the church.# 1) As long as Israel remains in disobedience, Jesus Christ will not return to rule on the Davidic throne.# 2) Presently, Jesus is seated at the right of the Father’s throne, not on David’s throne.# 4. We live in anticipation of a future literal reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.# a. Christ’s return to establish His reign will usher in the Millennial Kingdom (Rev 19-20).# b. Christ’s rule will be from Jerusalem. (Jer 3:17; Zec 14:16)# c. Christ’s rule will extend over Israel. (Eze 37:21-28)# d. Christ’s rule will extend beyond Israel to all the nations of the earth. (Psa 2:8; 72:8; Isa 49:6; Zec 9:10)# 5. World peace will not come through the social and political activity of secular humanism.# a. Isaiah 2:4 – And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war. The audacity of the UN to put the quote on their building indicates their contempt for the Davidic Covenant and God’s plan.# b. They have removed the Prince of Peace from the formula by placing themselves in His position.# 1) Permanent peace through humanism is impossible as it is set against the Creator – it is the thought system of the god of the world and not the God of creation.# 2) The world will preach “peace at any cost” but they are lying – the cost is humility to submit before the Creator and they will not do it. (1 Thes 5:3)# 3) Isaiah 9:6-7 – For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. Lasting peace will only come when the Prince of Peace personally rules the earth on the throne of David.# 4) Until then, do not be found supporting the enemy’s fabricated plan of false peace.# H. God’s New Covenant (Jer 31:31-34, Eze 36:22-38, 37:25-28, Heb 7, 8:6-13, 12, 13)# 1. Contrary to popular belief, the Old Covenant is not the Old Testament and the New Testament is not the New Covenant. In fact, the New Covenant is first introduced, promised and explained in the Old Testament.# 2. The New Covenant is an amplification to the blessing aspect of the Abrahamic covenant. Gen 12:1-3# a. Ezekiel 37:25 \u0026ldquo;They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons\u0026rsquo; sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever. This verse ties the Abrahamic covenant, the land (Jacob my servant) and a kingdom (David my servant) and people forever (their sons and their sons’ sons forever).# b. Ezekiel 37:26 \u0026ldquo;I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever. Here a future covenant is announced. The nature of this covenant of peace is unconditional (Ezekiel 36:21-23).# c. Ezekiel 37:27 \u0026ldquo;My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. God’s dwelling place refers to Israel walking with God. Here it is announced they will reflect God’s character to the nations.# d. Ezekiel 37:28 \u0026ldquo;And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.\u0026rdquo; This is an everlasting covenant (Isa 55:3, Isa 61:8-9, Jer 32:40, 50:5) and will serve for all to know that the Lord is the one who sanctifies Israel.# e. Ezekiel 16:59 For thus says the Lord GOD, \u0026ldquo;I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant. The only covenant Israel could have broken was the Mosaic covenant. Blessing under this covenant was conditioned upon their obedience.# f. Ezekiel 16:60 \u0026ldquo;Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. The covenant made in the days of her youth is in reference to the childhood of Israel, specifically going back to the Abrahamic covenant.# 3. Jeremiah 31:31-34 tells of the New Covenant that God would establish with Israel.# 1) Jeremiah 31:31 \u0026ldquo;Behold, days are coming,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. This is the first time a new covenant is mentioned in the Bible. The time of establishment of the covenant is not stated but who it will be with is clear that it is to Israel and to the house of Judah. Ratification of it would be future (compare Gen 6:18 with Gen 9:9). This will be a covenant with Israel and with the house of Judah.# 2) Jeremiah 31:32 not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. This covenant will be different in nature to the Mosaic covenant which was made between God and Israel in the land of Egypt.# a) Mosaic Covenant - the implication is that if the old covenant was made to Israel, then the new covenant is in contrast to the Mosaic covenant. (Heb 8:13)# 3) Jeremiah 31:33 \u0026ldquo;But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. This refers to the spiritual renewal Israel will undergo when they change their minds and believe in Jesus as Messiah. God’s law internalized. Jer 32:40# 4) Jeremiah 31:34 \u0026ldquo;They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, \u0026lsquo;Know the LORD,\u0026rsquo; for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.\u0026rdquo; Israel was always having to teach because they often forgot and were cursed as a result. A day will come when this will no longer be needed in Israel, all will know the Lord. Joel 2:28-32# a) The restored people is literal# (i) Will live on the hills of Samaria (Jer 31:5-6)# (ii) Israel and Judah will dwell together (Jer 31:24)# b. Ezekiel 36 also mentions some of the provisions of the New Covenant# 1) Physical return (Eze 36:22, 24, 28)# 2) Spiritual return (Eze 36:25-26)# 3) Cleansing of sin (Eze 36:25, 29, 33)# 4) Indwelling of the Spirit (Eze 36:27)# 5) Fertility in the land (Eze 36:29-30, 24-25)# 6) National repentance (Eze 36:31-32)# 7) Physical fertility (Eze 36:37-38)# 8) Sole devotion to God (Eze 36:33, Eze 34:25, 37:26)# 9) Perpetual, national existence (v. 35-37, Isa 24:5, 61:8-9, Jer 23:40, 50:5, Eze 16:60, 27:26)# 10) Jerusalem is permanently rebuilt (v. 38-40)# c. Timing of the New Covenant# 1) These provisions have never been fulfilled in Israel’s past and certainly not today, their fulfillment awaits a future kingdom age.# 2) When it would be ratified is mentioned (making or cutting a covenant) but timing is ambiguous from the Old Testament (Isa 55:3, 61:8, Jer 31:31, 32:40, Eze 34:25, 37:26)# 3) Fulfillment of the New Covenant will be In that day (Isa 42:6, 49:8, 59:21, Hos 2:18-20)# I. The New Covenant in relation to the Church# 1. It is possible that you may disagree with our conclusions regarding this next section of the study. We would ask you however to prayerfully consider it as a good Berean and see if it agrees or not with the Scriptures. Acts 17:11# 2. The Covenants (including the new covenant) were given to Israel (Rom 9:4) so in order to have a better grasp, we must define who true Israel is. Heb 8:10# a. Many Bible teachers today would have us believe that all of the promises in the bible are for every believer. This is a mistaken conclusion and sadly lacking of truth. While God never changes, while his character is always intact and his promises are trustworthy, his interaction with man as it pertains to his administration has undergone change and we can also see in unfulfilled prophecy that changes are yet to come.# b. Romans 9:6 And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. As Paul concludes his letter to the Galatians, he speaks of them (Gentile believers) and upon the Israel of God (Jewish believers). Rom 11:1-2, Rom 11:25-26# 1) To be a true Israelite one must not only be ethnically Jewish but also a believer. Jesus was saying Nathanael was a believing Jew in John 1:47 when he first spoke to him, “…Lo, truly an Israelite*, in whom guile is not.*\u0026rdquo; YLT# c. Romans 11:26-27 and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB. THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\u0026rdquo; Removal of sins has only ever been possible through faith in Christ not by being born an Israelite. To be a true Israelite, one must be born a Jew and also believe.# 1) All Israel can in no way be seen as being saved today. The covenant God has with them however says all of Israel will be saved.# 3. Though the parties of the New Covenant are Israel and God, the church has been spiritually incorporated to take part of this blessing. How?# a. First, let’s take a look at what this does not mean# 1) The church did not replace God’s program with Israel# a) Israel is geo-political, national and ethnic in nature, the church is not.# b) True Israel is not the church but rather believing Israel# 2) The New covenant is not being fulfilled today# 3) The church involvement is not discussed in the Old Testament# 4) The church is not under a covenant# b. God had said to Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed through him. Gentiles have become blessed through their inclusion by faith in Jesus Christ.# 4. Jesus Christ is the reason why the church partakes of the New Covenant blessings# a. He is the mediator of the New Covenant. Heb 8:6# b. Hebrews 10:9 then He said, \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.\u0026rdquo; He takes away the first in order to establish the second.# 1) Taking away the “first” means to take away ritual sacrifices of the Mosaic covenant. Jesus Christ fulfilled this conditional covenant given to Israel. Mat 5:17# 2) Establishing the ”second” means to replace ritual sacrifices with the righteous life of Jesus who was crucified in man’s place as a true substitute sacrifice for sin (1 John 2:1-2).# c. Hebrews 10:10 By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. We here refers to the church. Heb 10:15# d. Hebrews 10:11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; Under the Mosaic covenant, the priestly duty was never finished. It was merely a demonstration of what was needed to make purification for sins.# e. Hebrews 10:12 *but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD…*Christ however, by becoming a substitutionary sacrifice, offering himself on our behalf, was sufficient for all time and is now seated.# f. Hebrews 10:13 waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. Sitting on His throne, Jesus is now waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for His feet when the New Covenant Kingdom of God comes to the earth.# 1) While Jesus is making intercession for the saints, He is also waiting for God the Father to subjugate all His enemies.# 2) The enemies of Christ will be subdued at the Second Advent when Jesus comes back to save His people Israel from its Gentile enemies and set up the promised Messianic Kingdom prophesied throughout the Old Testament (Psalm 110:1-7; 2:1-12; Jeremiah 30:1-11; 31:1-6, 27-40; Zechariah 12:10; 14:2-5; Revelation 19:11-20:6; Hebrews 1:14; 2:5-8; 4:9; 12:22-29; 1 Corinthians 15:20-28).# 3) While Jesus waits for the fulfillment of Israel’s prophetic covenants, the special dispensation of the church age has been revealed in the meantime through the New Testament mystery truths to confer salvation and great heavenly blessings upon Christians so they might be a witness to the enemies of Christ (Ephesians 2:14-3:11; Colossians 1:25-29; 2 Corinthians 5:14-21).# 4) While Jesus waits to take control of His enemies, today is a day of grace for both believers and unbelievers to take advantage of (Hebrews 3:7-15; 10:25; 2 Corinthians 6:1-2; Romans 2:4; 11:22).# g. Hebrews 10:14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. Jesus has perfected forever those who are being sanctified (being saved), i.e., the saints, through His one-time sacrificial offering on the cross (Hebrews 10:10, 12; 7:25-28).# 1) The complete and efficacious onceness of the sacrificial offering of Jesus Christ, in contrast to Old Testament offerings, is strongly emphasized even further (Romans 6:10; 1 Peter 3:18).# a) The cross is, therefore, not only necessary, but also sufficient for salvation as nothing else be dare added (John 19:30; Colossians 2:8-15).# b) Did Jesus Christ do enough on the cross to save you from you sins? Hebrews 10:14 resoundingly says affirmative (John 6:35-40, 48-58)!# h. Hebrews 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, now, through the Holy Spirit, the church is also made partakers of the new covenant blessings.# i. Hebrews 10:16 \u0026ldquo;THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,\u0026rdquo; He then says…them. This goes back to Israel and to the original promise made in Jeremiah 31:31-34.# j. Hebrews 10:17 \u0026ldquo;AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.\u0026rdquo; Because of the new covenant, Israel’s sins will be forgiven.# k. Hebrews 10:18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin. The blood of the New Covenant is for the forgiveness of sins. Forgiveness of sins was a promise made to Israel in connection to the new covenant (Jer 31:34, Matt 26:17-35, Lev 17:11).# 1) Now, because Christ’s blood ratified the covenant and because his blood was also shed for sin of the whole world, the church (Jews and Gentiles) have become partakers of the blessings without annulling or affecting in any way the inauguration and fulfillment of the new covenant to Israel as a nation.# l. Christ’s blood is the means by which the New Covenant is ratified. Jesus instituted the Lord’s supper for the church which commemorates this covenant. Each time the church celebrates the Lord’s table, it commemorates the New covenant ‘cutting ceremony’ in the shedding of Christ’s blood. (Heb 9:26) The new covenant is completely by God’s grace, totally undeserved by Israel.# 1) Christ’s blood ratified the New Covenant just like blood ratified the Mosaic (Ex 24:8, Luk 22:20)# a) Previous covenants were announced then ratified# (i) Noahic (Gen 6:18 - Gen 9:9)# (ii) Abrahamic (Gen 12:1-3 - Gen 15)# (iii) Mosaic (Exo 3:8 – Exo 24:8)# (iv) New Covenant (Jer 31:31 – the cross)# 2) 1 Corinthians 11:25 - In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\u0026rdquo; Paul teaches the Corinthian church of the significance of the cup in the breaking of bread. The cup was a symbol of the blood Christ shed to ratify the new covenant.# 5. The church is the body and possession of Jesus Christ, therefore it has become partaker of the New Covenant blessings through the promised Holy Spirit.# 1) Mention is made that blessing would flow to the Gentiles upon ratification (Isa 55:5, Eze 36:36, 37:28)# 2) The church was a mystery in the Old Testament era (Eph 3:1-13), therefore we should not be surprised that the church is not mentioned in connection with the new covenant. The Old Testament simply contained no information regarding the church of Jesus Christ.# 3) What are some of the blessings the church partakes of the new covenant?# a) The church has been made servants of the new covenant. 2 Cor 3:6 says, “who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.”# (i) Christ became a servant to confirm to Israel the promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, specifically the new covenant. Rom 15:8-13\nb) The forgiveness of sins# c) The Holy Spirit# (i) He sanctifies us,# (ii) He instructs us,# (iii) He empowers us for service,# (iv) He seals us until the day of redemption# Israel Church Similarities God Yahweh Kingdom Coming Kingdom Redemption Redemption (individual) Mission (light to nations) Differences Began Abraham Isaac Jacob Day of Pentecost Group Ethnic Non-ethnic Entity National International (spiritual organism) Priesthood inside nation Everyone is a priest Jesus as King Jesus as head/leader 6. The new covenant has not been inaugurated yet since it’s fulfillment is set for the coming kingdom, yet the church is already partaking to a certain degree of some of its spiritual blessings. God has already equipped the church with the Holy Spirit and is preparing the church as future servants of the new covenant to serve in the age to come when she will reign and rule with Christ when all of the new covenant blessings are fulfilled in the Messianic Kingdom.# # ** **\n# J. Conclusion# # K. Adamic “Covenant II” - after the fall God’s curse and promise to Adam (Gen 3:14-24)# 1. If this is a covenant it is by implication and in connection to the first.# a. Best understood as a new administration because sin entered into the world.# 2. Adam’s sin causes God to change the relationship with man and creation (Gen 3:17)# a. The land and soil is cursed, it will require toil for the land to produce.# b. Driven out of the garden to protect the way of tree of life lest man take of the fruit and live separated from God forever. (Gen 3:22)# 3. Relationships are now uneven, even hurtful (Gen 3:16)# a. Her desire is for husband but he will rule over her# b. Childbearing will now have multiplied pain# 4. Ground is cursed (Gen 3:17)# a. Food is from farming the soil not God’s garden# 5. God’s Promise (Gen 3:15)# a. Deliverer will come# b. Satan will be crushed# 6. Knowledge apart from God (Gen 3:22)# a. Confusion (what is reality? What is truth?)# b.

      "content":" Confession of Sins Searching what the Scriptures actually teach\nNote: Spiritual death, relational death, physical death are all different forms of separation. It is not in the scope of this study but we presume the reader understands that death in the Scriptures means separation not cessation of existence.\nI. Biblical Forms of Separation (death)# A. Spiritual Separation# 1. Spiritual separation is the reality of every person when they are born. This is the spiritual reality (death or separation from God) of every person born after Adam.# 2. Therefore nothing has to be done in order for this to be broken. It is already broken.# 3. This reality can be changed however. It occurs individually when a person places their faith in Jesus Christ. At the point of trusting in Christ as saviour, having paid for his sin, a person receives life eternal, placed in union with God through Christ.# Christ, the God-man is the eternal union between man and God.# Christ Himself eternal is:# a. Our peace with God. Romans 5:1, Micah 5:5# b. Our mediator to peace of God. Matthew 11:28, 2 Thessalonians 3:16# c. The propitiation for our sins. 2 John 2:2, Hebrews 2:17# d. Our advocate before the Father. 2 John 2:1# e. Our acceptance.# f. Our great high priest.# g. God with us.# h. Our reconciliation. 2 Corinthians 5:19# i. our strength. 2 Timothy 4:17# j. Our life. Ephesians 2:5# f. Our hope.# g. God with us.# 1. Man willfully sins, it is not God who makes him sin.# \u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?\u0026rdquo; Genesis 3:11\na. When Adam and Eve sinned, it was God who sought them out to restore fellowship.# They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Where are you?\u0026rdquo; Genesis 3:8-9\nb. Notice that the purpose for hiding among the trees was not to hide from the heat or any other reason. They hid themselves from the presence of the Lord.# 2. Sin resulted in fear of God, a change of perception of self, and lead to hiding.# He said, \u0026ldquo;I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.\u0026rdquo; Genesis 3:10\n3. Their natural instinct was not run to God, they ran from God# a. QUESTION: What would have happened if Adam and Eve had confessed their sin to God?# 1) Option A - God would have forgiven them.# i) if God would have forgiven them, then there\u0026rsquo;s no need for the cross.# 2) Option B - Nothing - God could not forgive them based on their confession. Payment for their sin needed to be made in order to right the wrong.# 1. Adam and Eve needed to restore the wrong with God somehow.# a. Sin could be paid for by good works# i. of course this contradicts the whole of Scripture.# b. Sin could be erased# c. Sin could be paid for# B. Relational Separation# 1. While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion or fellowship with Him can# Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? 2 Corinthians 6:14\nWhen is fellowship broken between the believer and God?# for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light. Ephesians 5:8\nThen Jesus again spoke to them, saying, \u0026ldquo;I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.\u0026rdquo; John 8:12\nC. How is fellowship restored between the believer and God?# Does 1 John 1:9 teach that confession of sins restores our relationship with God?# James tells us God IS light and in Him there is no darkness at all.# This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. 1 John 1:5\nIf we say we have fellowship with Him yet do not walk in fellowship we lie.# If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; 1 John 1:6\nIf we walk in the light we will have fellowship with one another - because we have fellowship with God.# but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. 1 John 1:7\nIf we say we have no sin, we aren\u0026rsquo;t walking in the Light, because the light causes us to reveal our imperfections (sins) and we see our sin.# If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us. 1 John 1:8\nBy walking in the Light, we are revealed our sins, we confess our sins and are cleansed in our fellowship with one another.# If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9\n"},{

No one could revoke this law. Yet, they will learn, there is one who is sovereign over men who is above any Medo-Persian law. Daniel 6:18 Darius\u0026rsquo;s Sleepless night# Daniel 6:18# Dan 6:18 Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.\nDarius\u0026rsquo; soul is troubled\nsleepless night\nwe’re led to feel sorry for the king.\nwrong side\nno rest\nsoul is under turmoil for doing wrong\nnobles sealed the stone. perhaps the kings seal was more for daniels protection from the nobles. And the noble\u0026rsquo;s seal is to make sure the king would not break Daniel out?\nDaniel could have thrown himself to the mercy of the nobles. he could have begged for mercy from the king. Daniel knew the law. Daniel was subject to its vain way just like Darius the king.\nDarius is a slave to his own system.\nlogically corrupted morally weak ethically wrong ironically, it\u0026rsquo;s legally right. Sometimes the law is just plain wrong, yet God is not delivering Daniel from the lions den. He delivers him from the Lions in the den. God has granted to governments to hold this authority, that is why it\u0026rsquo;s so important what they do with God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty. When they don\u0026rsquo;t recognize that God granted them that position and the very existence of government, everything colapses very quickly. Daniel 6:19-23 Daniel\u0026rsquo;s Deliverance from the Lions# Daniel 6:19# Dan 6:19 Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions\u0026rsquo; den.\nDid his grief overcome his fear of the nobles? Probably because the conditions of the law were met. Daniel had paid the demands of the law.\nDaniel 6:20# Dan 6:20 When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, \u0026ldquo;Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?\u0026rdquo;\nnote: \u0026lsquo;servant of the living God\u0026rsquo;, he is first and foremost a servant of God not servant of the medes and persians. This speaks that a servant of the living God can be an excelent benefit to those he is around as he reflects the God he serves. \u0026lsquo;constantly serve\u0026rsquo; - recognized as a servant of Jehovah. Daniel was known by Darius to constantly serve his God. Daniel was supernaturally delivered from the lions, not the den. Darius delivered Daniel from the den. Daniel 6:21# Dan 6:21 Then Daniel spoke to the king, \u0026ldquo;O king, live forever!\nPerhaps Daniel is surprised the king actually came? He expresses happiness to hear the king\u0026rsquo;s voice.\nDaniel is a cheerful fellow. He\u0026rsquo;s not complaining, he\u0026rsquo;s quick with a salutation to the king.\nDaniel 6:22# Dan 6:22 \u0026ldquo;My God sent His angel and shut the lions\u0026rsquo; mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.\u0026rdquo;\nDaniel recognizes his God (my God) as his ultimate deliverer and provider and recognizes the king’s authority. His innocence is unquestionably demonstrated by his deliverance. God defends Daniel Daniel 6:23# Dan 6:23 Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.\nMiraculous without a doubt. No harm had come to Daniel.\nWhen did Daniel trust his God? In the den of lions? I\u0026rsquo;m sure he did, but the trusting referred to in context is from before when he continued as usual praying three times a day. v. 10, 13, 16\nA word about faith - faith is not about the quantity or quality, it\u0026rsquo;s about the object in whom it\u0026rsquo;s placed. Paul expresses that\u0026hellip;\n2Ti 1:12 For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.\nPaul had believed, Paul was convinced, and had entrusted himself. But Paul\u0026rsquo;s faith weak or strong, was in God. That is the key! Daniel said, My God. Abraham\u0026rsquo;s faith was in God who He knew was able to perform that which he had said.\nEspecially encouraging to the Jews in the Second Temple period. They could identify with Daniel’s plight; their faith could be strengthened by God’s miraculous intervention. This would encourage them to put their faith in God.\nDaniel’s kind of faith should encourage us today as we face the pressures of living faithfully to God in these trying times of the Gentiles. We can trust God.\nfancy palace cave with lions entertainment - none can soothe his mind supernatural miracle - Daniel entertained watching an angel shut the lions mouths. Front seat to the Best circus act ever. Darius fasted lions fasted Dairus\u0026rsquo; soul in greatest physical comfort but troubled. soul among lions but at rest. No physical comfort but peace of God. Peter slept in prison victim of doing wrong. Spends night in guilt victim for doing right. 1 Pet 2:20 \u0026ldquo;But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.\u0026rdquo; reader ends up feeling sorry for this poor king suspense. reader is not even told until afterwards to encourage the king as it were. Daniel 6:24 The Conspirator\u0026rsquo;s Doom# Daniel 6:24# Dan 6:24 The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions\u0026rsquo; den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\nHe was not spared on account of the lions’ lack of hunger; he was spared because of God’s intervention.\ncultural to send all close relatives to same demise so there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be danger of revenge. Daniel 6:25-28 Darius\u0026rsquo; Decree# Daniel 6:25# Dan 6:25 Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: \u0026ldquo;May your peace abound!\nDaniel 6:26# Dan 6:26 \u0026ldquo;I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be forever.\nNebuchadnezzar forbade blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (3:29); Darius orders all people to tremble and fear before Him (v. 26).\nThe king’s declaration of God’s greatness would have promulgated a healthy fear of God throughout the Persian Empire\nDaniel 6:27# Dan 6:27 \u0026ldquo;He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.\u0026rdquo;\nThe king spoke of God’s power to save. He included Daniel’s deliverance from the lions as living proof of God’s delivering power.\nHeb 11:33 who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,\nDaniel 6:28# Dan 6:28 So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.\nGod gave Daniel success in a pagan regime.\na. This event happened just prior to the end of Israel’s prophesied seventy years of captivity.\nb. King Cyrus would soon encourage Israel’s return to the land.\nc. Did Daniel’s testimony of faith in God, his integrity, and the exposing of his conspirators play a part in Cyrus’ positive actions toward the exiles of Israel?\nd. The stage was set for Jewish refugees to return to the Promised Land. Since Daniel, who represented the best of Israel, was seen as loyal to his adoptive government, the Jewish people would not be perceived as subversive or threating to the kingdom.\nA note on Darius and Cyrus# Jesus authenticated prophet Daniel \u0026ldquo;Let the reader understand\u0026rdquo;\nDarius was appointed king by someone greater (Cyrus de Great) Daniel 9:1\nDan 9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans —\nThis shows how the bear in chapter 7 perfectly reflects the Medo-Persian empire. The Persian part was above the Median. Cyrus the Great the overall king and Darius the Mede was king over the province of the Chaldeans or Babylon.\nDarius’ reign and Cyrus’ reign are the same not successive.\n"},{

      "content":"This is the account of Nebuchadnezzar\u0026rsquo;s Image - False Worship\nMan by default is religious. He will bow to something. God created man in his image. Mankind creates gods in their image. Romans 1:18-32\nWorshipping God in our own way is also adultery.\nEven though we might not bow down to any statue we can \u0026lsquo;bow\u0026rsquo; to gods in our hearts and minds.\nWhy did Nebuchadnezzar build this image? He was thinking about this since God spoke to him in the dream and visions, except he distorted it to his own benefit.\nIs it possible that Nebuchadnezzar was dreaming of building a statue before God spoke to him? Certainly somehow they are related. Did God meet Nebuchadnezzar where he was at or did Nebuchadnezzar twist what God had said to his favour, so that all rule will be his?\nAt the end of Daniel 4, Nebuchadnezzar apparently believes in God, but at this point he is still ignorant of the all sovereign God of the universe. Nebuchadnezzar is thinking his is the greatest power.\nDan 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.\n60x6 = 10 to 1. This is the dimensions of obelisks.\nDan 3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\nBabylon\u0026rsquo;s way is work the top and move down\nDan 3:3 Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nRev 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth committed acts ofimmorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.\u0026quot;\nRev 18:3 \u0026ldquo;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts ofimmorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.\u0026rdquo;\nDan 3:4 Then the herald loudly proclaimed: \u0026ldquo;To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,\nFirst the leaders, now get the people to follow. Everybody drinks of Babylon\u0026rsquo;s wine.\nDan 3:5 that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.\nMusic is also used a lot within pagan worship.\nDan 3:6 \u0026ldquo;But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.\u0026rdquo;\nWorship or be burned\nDan 3:7 Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\nThe sound of music is generally associated with gladness. This was brought on from idolatry. God will destroy all music from Babylon becuase of her idolatry and treatment of God\u0026rsquo;s people over the ages.\nRevelation 18:22, \u0026ldquo;And the sound of harpists, musicians, flute players, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again; and no craftsman of any craft will ever be found in you again; and the sound of a mill will never be heard in you again;\u0026rdquo;\nDan 3:8 For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.\nChaldeans don\u0026rsquo;t like these three men being superior\nDan 3:9 They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: \u0026ldquo;O king, live forever!\nThey respected the king God had placed.\nDan 3:10 \u0026ldquo;You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image.\nRev 18:16 saying, \u0026lsquo;Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;\nDan 3:11 \u0026ldquo;But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.\nWorship or die.

Psalm 77:1-6 Asaph doubts God# (For the choir director; according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.)\nPsa 77:1 My voice rises to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice rises to God, and He will hear me.# The Psalmist goes to God. He cries out to God. God is who will listen. In the midst of uncontrollable hurt, trauma, frustration when we can\u0026rsquo;t even make sense of our own thoughts and are flooded with emotion, I have found this Psalm to provide guidance and great encouragement.\nPsa 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness; My soul refused to be comforted.# Sleepless nights, troubled, no comfort in sight sound familiar? I believe believers all experience some form of grief at one time or another. To experience Sickness, be jobless, lose a loved one. We find ourselves overwhelmed by profound sorrow, but also stress, anxiety, depression. This is all too familiar these days Psa 77:3 When I remember God, then I am disturbed; When I sigh, then my spirit grows faint. Selah.# The thought of God can become disturbing, (disturbing: to be in great commotion or tumult, to rage, war, moan, clamor) We know God is over all. God is all powerful. Why does God allow this in my life? It\u0026rsquo;s easy to become convinced God is not on top of things. God has changed. God is upset at me because i\u0026rsquo;m less than perfect. Every time God comes to mind, it is disrupting. Not happy. I need happy. Happy thoughts. Not this, spiritual christians aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to feel this. Thoughts of God can be the last thing we feel we need. Know this is real. I\u0026rsquo;d never doubt God, God could never disturb me\u0026hellip;put it this way, have you ever shunned away from getting into Scripture for fear of what you might find? The psalmist went through it. Psa 77:4 Thou hast held my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.# This is not a statement of resignation or of trust but an accusation. God has caused him to be troubled and now he\u0026rsquo;s speechless. Psa 77:5 I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago.# here Asaph begins comparing his present situation with the \u0026lsquo;good ol days\u0026rsquo;. Kind of like Israel when they thought about Egypt. Like me saying I was better off before I began walking with the Lord. Someone might say, never say that! God might strike you dead with lightning! That is not the Psalmists approach. Psa 77:6 I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart; And my spirit ponders.# Asaph is singing the blues in Aminor. This is not the same tune Paul and Silas are singing while in the Jail at Filipi. II. Psalm 77:7-9 Asaph\u0026rsquo;s Six questions about God# These are deep, existential questions. The Psalmist leads us into six foundational questions he asked in the time of grief. Psa 77:7 Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again? (Rom 11:1-2)# Presumption: 1. God has rejected me 2. This situation will last forever 3. God has withdrawn whatever he once gave me.\nRom 11:1 I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. Rom 11:2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?\nPsa 77:8 Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? Has His promise come to an end forever? (Núm 23:19)# Presumption: 1. God has ceased being loving to me 2. God does not keep His promises 3. Gods acceptance must be earned. 4. God doesn’t always keep his promises\nNum 23:19 \u0026quot;God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?\nPsa 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.# Presumption: 1. God has forgotten about me 2. My problem is too big for God 3. God is not good enough 4. God is angry at me 5. I have failed\nIsa 40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, \u0026quot;My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God\u0026quot;? Isa 40:28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired. His understanding is inscrutable.\nJacob went through this and never seemed to come out the other side. Summary: We can surmise that the pain in this persons life made him doubt and question God’s character. He is confronted with an experience that is seemingly too much for God. God is perceived to be angry perhaps suggesting there must also be personal guilt.\nthere can be no question as to this: Situations like these are far more than Asaph can handle, you and I either. It is not as though God is testing you to see if you are resolute enough, strong enough. ##III. Psalm 77:10-14 A corrected perspective of the Character of God\nPsa 77:10 Then I said, \u0026ldquo;It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed.\u0026rdquo;# Psa 73:21 When my heart was embittered And I was pierced within, Psa 73:22 Then I was senseless and ignorant; I was like a beast before You.\nPsa 77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity…KJV\n“The meaning of this phrase is not, as would appear from our translation, that his reflections on the subject were to be traced to his weakness, or were a proof of weakness of mind, but that the subject overpowered him.” - Barnes\nThe Psalmist\u0026rsquo;s line of questioning leads to a conclusive answer: preposterous! God is not unfaithful, God is good, God will never leave or forsake, God is a jealous God (He deeply desires you), God is love, God is kind, God is compassionate, His mercies are new every morning, God is seeking out to be known by you, deeply, truly, wonderfully.\nAsaph knows enough to conclude none of his presumptions are founded in reality but only in his sentiment of the present experience. He identifies the problem The true cause of his state becomes apparent. You see we can truly rejoice in the midst of troubles. Not because we have the willpower but because we know God is good and he uses all our circumstances for good.\nThe Psalmist has been so preoccupied with his affliction that he has lost faith in the goodness and grace of God. Look how often the psalmist uses the words ‘I’ and ‘me’ in this psalm. By doing so removed his focus on God. The point is not \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t be like Asaph\u0026rdquo;. Rather if/when you find yourself in this some day, if you\u0026rsquo;re here today and God seems distant even angry, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. -Asaph thus acknowledges that the problem does not lie with God, but with his overwhelming grief causing God to seem altogether different.\nPsalm 77:11 I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; Surely I will remember Thy wonders of old.# Psalm 77:12 I will meditate on all Thy work, And muse on Thy deeds.# Psa 77:13 Thy way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God?# God is holy but also his way is holy Psa 77:14 Thou art the God who workest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.# God has clearly shown his great strength to all. in fact he does this daily through creation.\nPsalmist turns his attention to God as revealing himself through history. Psalmist remembers, meditates, muses on God\nIII. Psalm 77:15 God is who Gives life# Psa 77:15 Thou hast by Thy power redeemed Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.# Jacob vs Joseph\nthe story of Jacob vs Joseph is telling. Both went through grief. Jacob lost his son while Joseph lost everything and was sold into slavery. Both experienced grief in their lives. Joseph\nGen 45:7 \u0026quot;**God** sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.\nGen 50:20 \u0026quot;As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive. Gen 50:21 \u0026quot;So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.\u0026quot; So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.\nJacob\nGen 46:3 He said, \u0026quot;**I am God, the God of your father;**\nGen 44:29 'If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.'\nGen 46:29 Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time. Gen 46:30 Then Israel said to Joseph, \u0026quot;Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.\u0026quot;\nboth Jacob and Joseph are among those redeemed. Yet one saw God using the trial for good while the other failed to see God because of the trial. Gen 45:7 \u0026quot;**God** sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance\nGen 44:30 ”since his life is bound up in the lad's life…”\nRom 8:32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things? IV. Psalm 77:16-20 Two examples of God working in the past# Psa 77:16 The waters saw Thee, O God; The waters saw Thee, they were in anguish; The deeps also trembled.# Psa 77:17 The clouds poured out water; The skies gave forth a sound; Thy arrows flashed here and there.# Psa 77:18 The sound of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.# is Asaph alluding to the flood? Why? Because even in the worldwide destruction at the flood, God never ceased being who he is. Psa 77:19 Thy way was in the sea, And Thy paths in the mighty waters, And Thy footprints may not be known.# Psa 77:20 Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.# God miraculously saved Israel from Egypt in the Red Sea. Isa 52:10 The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, That all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God. V. Conclusion# Jacob: his life was wrapped up in the life of his son\nJoseph: God used circumstances intended for evil by others for the ultimate good of mankind\nUs: wrapped up in Gods son.\nCol 3:1 Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Col 3:2 Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. Col 3:3 For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. Col 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to doubt and question God when things don\u0026rsquo;t go well (Psalm 77:1-9) Knowing God\u0026rsquo;s true self (as revealed in Scripture), provides a framework around our chaos (Psalm 77:10-14) Christ is our life (Psalm 77:15) Eph 6:13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. .\n"},{

      "content":"Discipleship# The Importance# Have you ever wondering why the apostle Paul writes an explanation of the Gospel to believers in Rome? Why does Paul clarify the Gospel to the Corinthian saints? Why would Paul defend the Gospel to the Galatian church? It seems redundant to waste words teaching the Gospel to believers.\nI was once laughed at for articulating the Gospel to a family who was interested in our ministry. I tried to impress on them the need we saw of clarifying the Gospel to people in this generation. I believe they thought I was treating them as ignorant (as unknowing) and perhaps they felt offended. The fact is, I often shy away from sharing the Gospel especially among believers becuase I presume everybody already understands it. What\u0026rsquo;s more, It\u0026rsquo;s usually not for fear of being redundant but a fear of offending.\nWhy would Paul write a lengthy letter to the Romans clarifying the Gospel? He already knew they were saved, in fact he affirms them in their identity in Christ at the beginning of the letter. The answer lies in what Paul understand of the purpose of the church.\nRom 10:15 How will they preach unless they are sent?

Requiere una experiencia real, que narra como sucedió.# es importante que lo que sabemos esta basado en la realidad.# Es irónico que las universidades (el lugar que uno va para adquirir conocimiento) es el lugar que le enseñar a pensar que no sabemos porque pero lo sabemos. No podemos estar convencidos del mundo ahi afuera. Dicen que todo es basado el lo que uno cree. Cada uno puede creer lo que piensa. no te parece inútil este punto de vista?# falsa conclusión: hay muchas cosas que sabemos y sabemos lo que sabemos.# ¿Que es el cristianismo?# - una religion? Más que una religion, un relación?# - paz con Dios?# - principios para vivir?# - Una relación íntima con Jesus?# - Cristianimo es la cosmovision de la realidad# Cosmovisión Bíblica: 4 elementos# creacion, como empieza todo# fall, problem/conflicto# rededción, solucion - como se trae una solución# restoración - como resulta todo al final de la historia.# Nuestra cosmovision es como entendemos todo. Es importante tener una correcta cosmovision. Sino, caeremos en el error de malinterpretar las cosas, y no según lo que es real.# El Cristianismo es la historia del mundo conforme a la realidad. Es una forma de ver el mundo. Es la historia de como el mundo comenzó, porque el mundo es como es, que parte nos corresponde en el drama, y como todo las tramas del libro llegan a ser resultos.# I. Dios# Un Dios Personal - no una cosa# Si Dios existe, y es una persona y no solo una cosa, no es lógico pensar que se manifestaría?# Porque Dios es relacional y porque se revela, podemos conocerlo, personalmente. a. Creación, b. habló# Un Dios Creador -# 1. Dios creo todo bien. Todo en su lugar. Todo trabajaba según su propósito. En el principio todo era muy bueno, como Dios lo creó.# 2. Ya que dios creo TODO de la NADA, todo le pertenece.# 3. Si Dios es personal y relacional y nos ha creado entonces nosotros estamos obligados a estar conectados a El de una manera u otra. Al no estar conectados a El, resultamos desfuncionales, corrompidos y rotos.# Rom 1:18 Porque la ira de Dios se revela desde el cielo contra toda impiedad e injusticia de los hombres, que con injusticia restringen la verdad.# Dios no dejo al mundo sin testimonio. El conocimiento de Dios esta al acceso de todos mediante lo creado.# Rom 1:19 Pero lo que se conoce acerca de Dios es evidente dentro de ellos, pues Dios se lo hizo evidente.# Rom 1:20 Porque desde la creación del mundo, Sus atributos invisibles, Su eterno poder y divinidad, se han visto con toda claridad, siendo entendidos por medio de lo creado, de manera que ellos no tienen excusa.# Dios dice que es bueno. Significa que Dios debe ser amable, amor, dadivoso, también imparcial, recto, honrado, correcto# Mar 10:18 Jesús le respondió\u0026hellip;Nadie es bueno, sino solo uno, Dios.# El Rey David dijo: Psa 100:5 Porque el SEÑOR es bueno; Para siempre es Su misericordia, Y Su fidelidad por todas las generaciones.# PREGUNTA: Nosotros fuimos creados por Dios, no escogimos ser creados, ¿porque un Dios bueno nos condena al infierno a ser separados de El?# II. Hombre# por un lado el hombre es hecho de cuerpo físico. Por otro lado, humanos no son pequeños dioses. No somos supernaturales. somos criaturas.# Dependemos del Dios que nos hizo del polvo.# Sin emabargo somos las criaturas más especiales detro de todo lo creado.# Porque somos creados, tenemos valor.# El hombre es distinguido en la creación.# Una LEY: No tener a otros dioses# 1.

Vuélvanse, pues, cada uno de su mal camino y enmienden sus caminos y sus obras’”.# Jer 18:12 Pero ellos dirán: “Es en vano; porque vamos a seguir nuestros propios planes, y cada uno de nosotros obrará conforme a la terquedad de su malvado corazón”.# La pregunta, ¿Si Dios es bueno, porque hay maldad en el mundo? Es entonces totalmente predecible entendiendo la historia. Tiene sentido cuando entendemos que aunque Dios es enteramente bueno, el hombre se rebeló y con esa rebelion vino a consecuencia corrupción, maldad, dolor\u0026hellip;# PREGUNTA: Nosotros fuimos creados por Dios, no escogimos ser creados, porque nos condena al infierno a ser separados de El.# Casi todos creen en el infierno, pero casi nadie piensa terminar ahi.

El que hace mal debe pagar por sus males. III. Cristo y la Cruz# Un tipo de problema necesita el mismo tipo de solución.# 1Ti 1:15 Palabra fiel y digna de ser aceptada por todos: Cristo Jesús vino al mundo para salvar a los pecadores, entre los cuales yo soy el primero.# 2 Cosas sobre Jesus que son importantes# Quien era - humano, creció, paso hambre, es uno de nosotros.# Exisito antes de nacer. El tiene poder para perdonar pecados, Honor a Dios es honor a El, El juicio final en el dia de juicio pertenece a El. Ellos que confian en el, aunque mueran, vivirán.# Los milagros que hizo Jesus no eran para señalar a sus enseñanzas, era para que la gente miraran a El.# Jesus no fue crucificado por lo que hizo. Fue crucificado por quien afirmo ser. Dijo que era Dios.# En el principio era el verbo. En el principio creo Dios.# Joh 1:14 El Verbo se hizo carne, y habitó entre nosotros, y vimos Su gloria, gloria como del unigénito del Padre, lleno de gracia y de verdad.# Que hizo# Jesus no vino para ayudarnos a llevarnos bien.# No vino para enseñarnos como alimentar a los pobres.# No vino para restaurar justicia social.# Muchos afirmar que el propósito principal de venir a la tierra era para vivir una vida moral. No es asi.# Jesus hizo preguntas:# Mar 2:9 ¿Qué es más fácil, decir al paralítico: “Tus pecados te son perdonados”, o decirle:“Levántate, toma tu camilla y anda”?# Joh 1:38 ¿Qué buscan?# Joh 8:46 ¿por qué ustedes no me creen?# Mat 16:15 ¿quién decís que soy yo?# ¿Un buen maestro de moral?# ¿Sincero pero delirante?# ¿Deliberadamente malvado y engañoso?# ¿Un personaje completamente ficticio?# ¿Una persona real que fue embellecida con el tiempo?# ¿Quién afirmó ser?# Se puede eliminar todo lo que Jesus dijo e hizo para los pobres y la justicia social y no afectara su mensaje en absoluto. Por eso Juan no hizo ni una sola mención de pobresa ni injusticia. Jesus dio 4 discursos. Solo en el primer discurso menciona a los pobres pero no a los de la pobreza economica sino a los pobres en espíritu. Eso no significa que no le importaba a los pobres, pero también le importaba a los ricos, a lo oprobio e inclusive a los religiosos.# La historia de Jesus no enfoca en el trabajo de Cristianos, sino en su obra, en la obra de Dios.# En el cielo, Dios esta airado pero envio a su Hijo a la tierra\u0026hellip;# Joh 3:16 \u0026hellip; Dios dio a Su Hijo unigénito, para que tengan vida eterna.# Php 2:8 Y hallándose en forma de hombre, se humilló Él mismo, haciéndose obediente hasta la muerte, y muerte de cruz.# OBEDIENCIA: Dios dio con un plan. El plan de ir a redimir al mundo.# ¿Entonces, Porque vino? Acabamos de celebrar la navidad.# Heb 10:5-7 Por eso, cuando Cristo vino a este mundo, le dijo a Dios: «Tú no pides sacrificios a cambio de tu perdón; por eso me has dado un cuerpo. »Por eso te dije: “Aquí me tienes, para cumplir tu voluntad. Así me lo enseña la Ley de Moisés.”»# Joh 10:17 Por eso me ama el Padre, porque yo pongo mi vida, para volverla a tomar.# Joh 10:18 Nadie me la quita, sino que yo de mí mismo la pongo. Tengo poder para ponerla, y tengo poder para volverla a tomar. Este mandamiento recibí de mi Padre.# ¿Porque la exclusividad de Jesus?# El evangelio es Dios tomando la culpa sobre si, para que nosotros fuesemos librados de toda culpa.# Act 4:12 En ningún otro hay salvación, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres, en el cual podamos ser salvos».# Cristo vino a salvarnos. No de la pobreza, no de injusticia. Jesus vino a salvarnos del Padre que esta airado conta la injusticia del hombre. Romanos 1:18. Dios envio a su hijo para ser el pago necessario para satisfacer su ira y darnos perdon de pecados darnos vida eterna. Jesus vino para que el mismo fuera el pago por nuestras rebeliones.# Era imposible para el hombre mejorar su situación. Nuestra participacion fue pecar. Cristo vino a morir por pecadores.\nLa obra De Dios en la encarnacion y muerte de Cristo no tiene ningún valor para tu vida a no ser que lo creas.\nLa única manera que Dios puede dar salvación es por fe en Jesucristo. El creer en Cristo es depositar tu plena confianza que Cristo tomo tu lugar, que fue a la cruz por ti, pagando el precio necesario para tus pegados ante un Dios justo. Dios aceptó su pago a tu favor y le levantó de los muertos. Dios aceptó su obediencia de muerte de Cruz en tu lugar. Ahora Dios puede prometer vida eterna a todo aquel que en el cree.\n¿Lo crees?\nno es un salto al vacio, una creencia sin evidencia o razón, creencia apesar de lo comprobado.\nIV. Restauración# EL PROBLEMA #1: todos estan de acuerdo, el mundo no es como debe ser. Sin embargo la solución no es eliminar a Dios. Esto no resuelve nada. La maldad sigue existiendo. La pregunta es, como se resuelve?\nEl PROBLEMA #2: Solo un camino al cielo\n"},{

These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might\nEph 1:20 which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,\nEph 1:21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.\nEph 1:22 And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,\nEph 1:23 which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.\nEph 2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,\nEph 2:2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\nEph 2:3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.\nEph 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,\nEph 2:5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),\nEph 2:6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly placesin Christ Jesus,\nEph 2:7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\nEph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;\nEph 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\nEph 2:10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\nOne in Christ\nEph 2:11 Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called \u0026ldquo;Uncircumcision\u0026rdquo; by the so-called \u0026ldquo;Circumcision,\u0026rdquo; which is performed in the flesh by human hands—\nEph 2:12 remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.\nEph 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\nEph 2:14 For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,\nEph 2:15 by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,\nEph 2:16 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.\nEph 2:17 AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;\nEph 2:18 for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.\nEph 2:19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God\u0026rsquo;s household,\nEph 2:20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,\nEph 2:21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,\nEph 2:22 in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.\nEph 3:1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—\nEph 3:2 if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God\u0026rsquo;s grace which was given to me for you;\nEph 3:3 that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.\nEph 3:4 By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,\nEph 3:5 which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;\nEph 3:6 to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,\nEph 3:7 of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God\u0026rsquo;s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.\nEph 3:8 To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,\nEph 3:9 and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;\nEph 3:10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\nEph 3:11 This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,\nEph 3:12 in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.\nEph 3:13 Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.\nPrayer for Spiritual Strength\nEph 3:14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,\nEph 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,\nEph 3:16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,\nEph 3:17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,\nEph 3:18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,\nEph 3:19 and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.\nEph 3:20 Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,\nEph 3:21 to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.\nEph 4:1 Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,\nEph 4:2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,\nEph 4:3 being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\nEph 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;\nEph 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,\nEph 4:6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.\nEph 4:7 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ\u0026rsquo;s gift.\nEph 4:8 Therefore it says, \u0026ldquo;WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.\u0026rdquo;\nEph 4:9 (Now this expression, \u0026ldquo;He ascended,\u0026rdquo; what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?\nEph 4:10 He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)\nEph 4:11 And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some asevangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,\nEph 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;\nEph 4:13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.\nEph 4:14 As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;\nEph 4:15 but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,\nEph 4:16 from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.\nThe New Life\nEph 4:17 So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,\nEph 4:18 being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;\nEph 4:19 and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.\nEph 4:20 But you did not learn Christ in this way,\nEph 4:21 if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,\nEph 4:22 that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,\nEph 4:23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,\nEph 4:24 and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.\nEph 4:25 Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE of you WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.\nEph 4:26 BE ANGRY, AND yet DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,\nEph 4:27 and do not give the devil an opportunity.\nEph 4:28 He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need.\nEph 4:29 Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear.\nEph 4:30 Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\nEph 4:31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.\nEph 4:32 Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.\nEph 5:1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;\nEph 5:2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.\nEph 5:3 But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;\nEph 5:4 and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.\nEph 5:5 For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.\nEph 5:6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.\nEph 5:7 Therefore do not be partakers with them;\nEph 5:8 for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light\nEph 5:9 (for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),\nEph 5:10 trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.\nEph 5:11 Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;\nEph 5:12 for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.\nEph 5:13 But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.\nEph 5:14 For this reason it says, \u0026ldquo;Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.\u0026rdquo;\nEph 5:15 Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,\nEph 5:16 making the most of your time, because the days are evil.\nEph 5:17 So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.\nEph 5:18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,\nEph 5:19 speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;\nEph 5:20 always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;\nEph 5:21 and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.\nWives and Husbands\nEph 5:22 Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.\nEph 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.\nEph 5:24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.\nEph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,\nEph 5:26 so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,\nEph 5:27 that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.\nEph 5:28 So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;\nEph 5:29 for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,\nEph 5:30 because we are members of His body.\nEph 5:31 FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.\nEph 5:32 This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.\nEph 5:33 Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.\nEph 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.\nEph 6:2 HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),\nEph 6:3 SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.\nEph 6:4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.\nBondservants and Masters\nEph 6:5 Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;\nEph 6:6 not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.\nEph 6:7 With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,\nEph 6:8 knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.\nEph 6:9 And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.\nThe Whole Armor of God\nEph 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.\nEph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.\nEph 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.\nEph 6:13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.\nEph 6:14 Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,\nEph 6:15 and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE;\nEph 6:16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.\nEph 6:17 And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\nEph 6:18 With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,\nEph 6:19 and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,\nEph 6:20 for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.\nFinal Greetings\nEph 6:21 But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.\nEph 6:22 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.\nEph 6:23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\nEph 6:24 Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.\n====\nThe Letter of Paul to the\nEPHESIANS\nThe Blessings of Redemption\n​\tEph 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus cby the will of God,\nTo the dsaints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus:\n​\t2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n​\t3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,\n​\t4 just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love\n​\t5 He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,\n​\t6 to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.\n​\t7 In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace\n​\t8 which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight\n​\t9 He amade known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him\n​\t10 with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him\n​\t11 also we ahave obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,\n​\t12 to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.\n​\t13 In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,\n​\t14 who is agiven as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.\n​\t15 For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints,\n​\t16 do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers;\n​\t17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.\n​\t18 I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,\n​\t19 and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might\n​\t20 which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,\n​\t21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.\n​\t22 And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,\n​\t23 which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.\nMade Alive in Christ\n​\t2:1 And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,\n​\t2 in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.\n​\t3 Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.\n​\t4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,\n​\t5 even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),\n​\t6 and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,\n​\t7 so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.\n​\t8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;\n​\t9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n​\t10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.\n​\t11 Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed in the flesh by human hands—\n​\t12 remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, aexcluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.\n​\t13 But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near dby the blood of Christ.\n​\t14 For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,\n​\t15 by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might cmake the two into one new man, thus establishing peace,\n​\t16 and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.\n​\t17 And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near;\n​\t18 for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.\n​\t19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household,\n​\t20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone,\n​\t21 in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,\n​\t22 in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.\nPaul’s Stewardship\n​\t3:1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—\n​\t2 if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you;\n​\t3 that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.\n​\t4 By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,\n​\t5 which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;\n​\t6 to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,\n​\t7 of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.\n​\t8 To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,\n​\t9 and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;\n​\t10 so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.\n​\t11 This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,\n​\t12 in whom we have boldness and aconfident access through faith in Him.\n​\t13 Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.\n​\t14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,\n​\t15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,\n​\t16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,\n​\t17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,\n​\t18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,\n​\t19 and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.\n​\t20 Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,\n​\t21 to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.\nUnity of the Spirit\n​\t4:1 Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,\n​\t2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,\n​\t3 being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\n​\t4 There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;\n​\t5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,\n​\t6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.\n​\t7 But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.\n​\t8 Therefore it says,\n“When He ascended on high,\nHe led captive a host of captives,\nAnd He gave gifts to men.”\n​\t9 (Now this expression, “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?\n​\t10 He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)\n​\t11 And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,\n​\t12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;\n​\t13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the bknowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.\n​\t14 As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;\n​\t15 but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ,\n​\t16 from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.\nThe Christian’s Walk\n​\t17 So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,\n​\t18 being darkened in their understanding, bexcluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;\n​\t19 and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.\n​\t20 But you did not learn Christ in this way,\n​\t21 if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,\n​\t22 that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,\n​\t23 and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,\n​\t24 and put on the new self, which cin the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.\n​\t25 Therefore, laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.\n​\t26 Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,\n​\t27 and do not give the devil an opportunity.\n​\t28 He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need.\n​\t29 Let no aunwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear.\n​\t30 Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\n​\t31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.\n​\t32 Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.\nBe Imitators of God\n​\t5:1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;\n​\t2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.\n​\t3 But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;\n​\t4 and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.\n​\t5 For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.\n​\t6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.\n​\t7 Therefore do not be partakers with them;\n​\t8 for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light\n​\t9 (for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth),\n​\t10 atrying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.\n​\t11 Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;\n​\t12 for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.\n​\t13 But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.\n​\t14 For this reason it says,\n“Awake, sleeper,\nAnd arise from the dead,\nAnd Christ will shine on you.”\n​\t15 Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,\n​\t16 amaking the most of your time, because the days are evil.\n​\t17 So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.\n​\t18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,\n​\t19 speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;\n​\t20 always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to bGod, even the Father;\n​\t21 and be subject to one another in the bfear of Christ.\nMarriage Like Christ and the Church\n​\t22 Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.\n​\t23 For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.\n​\t24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.\n​\t25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,\n​\t26 so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,\n​\t27 that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.\n​\t28 So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;\n​\t29 for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,\n​\t30 because we are members of His body.\n​\t31 For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.\n​\t32 This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.\n​\t33 Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she brespects her husband.\nFamily Relationships\n​\t6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.\n​\t2 Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise),\n​\t3 so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth.\n​\t4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.\n​\t5 Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;\n​\t6 not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.\n​\t7 With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,\n​\t8 knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.\n​\t9 And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.\nThe Armor of God\n​\t10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.\n​\t11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.\n​\t12 For our struggle is not against bflesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.\n​\t13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.\n​\t14 Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,\n​\t15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace;\n​\t16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.\n​\t17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\n​\t18 With all prayer and petition bpray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, dbe on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,\n​\t19 and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,\n​\t20 for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.\n​\t21 But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.\n​\t22 aI have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.\n​\t23 Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\n​\t24 Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.\n====\nThe Letter of Paul to the*\nEPHESIANS\nPaul, an apostle of Christ Jesus cby the will of God, To the dsaints who are at Ephesus and who are faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight He amade known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, that is, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him also we ahave obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory. In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is agiven as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory. For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among you and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention of you in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed in the flesh by human hands— remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, aexcluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near dby the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might cmake the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; to be specific, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and aconfident access through faith in Him. Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it says, “When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives, And He gave gifts to men.” (Now this expression, “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the bknowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, bexcluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which cin the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Therefore, laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. Be angry, and yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not give the devil an opportunity. He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have something to share with one who has need. Let no aunwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints; and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them; for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light (for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), atrying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them; for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. For this reason it says, “Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.” Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, amaking the most of your time, because the days are evil. So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to bGod, even the Father; and be subject to one another in the bfear of Christ. Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must see to it that she brespects her husband. Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honor your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth. Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might. Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against bflesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition bpray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, dbe on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and pray on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. aI have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.\n====\n*The Letter of Paul to the* # EPHESIANS Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and *who are* faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. *There is* one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. # But to each one of us #\tgrace was given ##\taccording to the measure of Christ’s gift. ##\tTherefore it says, ##\t“When He ascended on high, ##\tHe led captive a host of captives, ##\tAnd He gave gifts to men.” ### (Now this *expression,* ###\t“He ascended,” ###\twhat does it mean ###\texcept that He also had descended ###\tinto the lower parts of the earth? ###\tHe who descended ###\tis Himself also He who ascended ###\tfar above all the heavens, ###\tso that He might fill all things.) #\tAnd He gave some *as* apostles, and some *as* prophets, and some *as* evangelists, and some *as* pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all *aspects* into Him who is the head, *even* Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. The Gentiles\u0026rsquo; Manner# So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in *the likeness of* God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Therefore, laying aside falsehood, **speak** truth each one *of you* with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. Be **angry**, and *yet* do not **sin**; do not let the sun **go down** on your anger, and do not **give** the devil an opportunity. He who steals must **steal** no longer; but rather he must **labor**, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have *something* to share with one who has need. Let no aunwholesome word **proceed** from your mouth, but only such *a word* as is good for edification according to the need *of the moment,* so that it will give grace to those who hear. Do not **grieve** the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be **put away** from you, along with all malice. **Be** kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Therefore **be** imitators of God, as beloved children; and **walk** in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be **named** among you, as is proper among saints; and *there must be no* filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. For this **you know with certainty**, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one **deceive** you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not **be** partakers with them; for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; **walk** as children of Light (for the fruit of the Light *consists* in all goodness and righteousness and truth), trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. Do not **participate** in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even **expose** them; for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. For this reason it says, “**Awake**, sleeper, And **arise** from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.” Therefore **be careful** how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. So then do not **be** foolish, but **understand** what the will of the Lord is. And do not **get drunk** with wine, for that is dissipation, but be **filled** with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives, *be subject* to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself *being* the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives *ought to be* to their husbands in everything. Husbands, **love** your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also *does* the church, because we are members of His body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to **love** his own wife even as himself, and the wife must *see to it* that she respects her husband. Children, **obey** your parents in the Lord, for this is right. **Honor** your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth. Fathers, do not **provoke** your children **to anger**, but **bring** them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Slaves, be **obedient** to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. And masters, **do** the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. Finally, be **strong** in the Lord and in the strength of His might. **Put on** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness in the heavenly *places.* Therefore, **take up** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. **Stand** firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil *one.* And **take** the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and *pray* on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible *love*. =====\nThe Letter of Paul to the\nEPHESIANS# A.\tIntroduction: Author and Readers# # Paul, ##\tan apostle ###\tof Christ Jesus ###\tby the will of God, # To the saints ## who are #\tat Ephesus ##\tand *who are* ###\tfaithful in Christ Jesus: ## Grace to you ## and peace from God ###\tour Father ###\tand the Lord Jesus Christ. B. Blessed with Christ# # Blessed *be* ##\tthe #\tGod ##\tand Father ###\tof our Lord Jesus Christ, #\twho has blessed us ## with every spiritual blessing ###\tin the heavenly *places* ###\tin Christ, 1. Blessed chosen in Him to be blameless# ##\tjust as #\tHe chose us in Him ##\tbefore the foundation of the world, ###\tthat we would be ####\tholy ####\tand blameless ####\tbefore Him. 2. Blessed with adoption as sons# ## In love # He predestined us # to adoption ##\tas sons ###\tthrough Jesus Christ ###\tto Himself, ###\taccording to the kind intention of His will, ###\tto the praise of the glory of His grace, ####\twhich He freely bestowed on us ####\tin the Beloved. 3. Blessed with redemption through His blood# ##\tIn Him # we have redemption ##\tthrough His blood, ##\tthe forgiveness of our trespasses, ###\taccording to the riches of His grace ###\twhich He lavished on us. 4. Blessed with the Knowledge of His will# ##\tIn all wisdom and insight #\tHe made known to us #\tthe mystery of His will, ##\taccording to His kind intention ###\twhich He purposed ###\tin Him ###\twith a view to an administration suitable ###\tto the fullness of the times, ###\t*that is*, the summing up of all things ###\tin Christ, ###\tthings in the heavens ###\tand things on the earth. 5. Blessed with an inheritance# ##\tIn Him also # we have obtained an inheritance, ##\thaving been predestined ###\taccording to His purpose ###\twho works all things ###\tafter the counsel of His will, ####\tto the end that we ####\twho were the first ###\tto hope in Christ ###\twould be to the praise of His glory. 6. Blessed Sealed in Him with Holy Spirit# ##\tIn Him, you also, ##\tafter listening to the message of truth, ##\tthe gospel of your salvation— ##\thaving also believed, #\tyou were sealed in Him #\twith the Holy Spirit of promise, ##\twho is given ##\tas a pledge of our inheritance, ###\twith a view ###\tto the redemption ###\tof *God’s own* possession, ###\tto the praise of His glory. C. Paul\u0026rsquo;s prayer for the Ephesian saints# For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which *exists* among you and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention *of you* in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. #\t*I pray that* #\tthe eyes of your heart #\tmay be enlightened, ##\tso that you will know ###\twhat is the hope of His calling, ###\twhat are the riches of the glory ###\tof His inheritance in the saints, ###\tand what is the surpassing greatness ###\tof His power toward us who believe. ###\t*These are* in accordance ###\twith the working ###\tof the strength of His might ####\twhich He brought about in Christ, ###\twhen He raised Him from the dead ###\tand seated Him at His right hand ###\tin the heavenly *places*, ###\tfar above all ###\trule ###\tand authority ###\tand power ###\tand dominion, ###\tand every name that is named, ####\tnot only in this age ####\tbut also in the one to come. ###\tAnd He put all things ###\tin subjection under His feet, ###\tand gave Him as head ###\tover all things to the church, ####\twhich is His body, ####\tthe fullness of Him ####\twho fills all in all. D. Saved by Grace# # And you were dead #\tin your trespasses #\tand sins, ##\tin which you formerly walked ###\taccording to the course of this world, ###\taccording to the prince of the power of the air, ###\tof the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. # But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, #\tmade us alive #\ttogether with Christ ##\t(by grace you have been saved), #\tand raised us up with Him, #\tand seated us with Him #\tin the heavenly *places* ##\tin Christ Jesus, ##\tso that in the ages to come ###\tHe might show the surpassing riches of His grace ###\tin kindness toward us ###\tin Christ Jesus. # For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, *it is* the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. Therefore **remember** that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” *which is* performed in the flesh by human hands— *remember* that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who made both *groups into* one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, *which is* the Law of commandments *contained* in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, *thus* establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner *stone*, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. E. The mystery of Christ# For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; *to be specific*, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly *places.* *This was* in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him. Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; *and* that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him *be* the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. F. The Walk Worthy of the Calling# Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to #\twalk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, #\twith all humility #\tand gentleness, #\twith patience, #\tshowing tolerance for one another ##\tin love, ##\tbeing diligent ##\tto preserve the unity of the Spirit ##\tin the bond of peace. *There is* one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it says, “When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives, And He gave gifts to men.” (Now this *expression,* “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) And He gave some *as* apostles, and some *as* prophets, and some *as* evangelists, and some *as* pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all *aspects* into Him who is the head, *even* Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. G. The Gentiles\u0026rsquo; Walk# So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk #\tno longer just as the Gentiles also walk, ##\tin the futility of their mind, ##\tbeing darkened in their understanding, ##\texcluded from the life of God ##\tbecause of the ignorance that is in them, ##\tbecause of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. H. How Then?# But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in *the likeness of* God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Like this# Therefore, laying aside falsehood, **speak** truth each one *of you* with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. Be **angry**, and *yet* do not **sin**; do not let the sun **go down** on your anger, and do not **give** the devil an opportunity. He who steals must **steal** no longer; but rather he must **labor**, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have *something* to share with one who has need. Let no aunwholesome word **proceed** from your mouth, but only such *a word* as is good for edification according to the need *of the moment,* so that it will give grace to those who hear. Do not **grieve** the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be **put away** from you, along with all malice. **Be** kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Therefore **be** imitators of God, as beloved children; and **walk** in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. Not like this# conduct# But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be **named** among you, as is proper among saints; and *there must be no* filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. For this **you know with certainty**, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. conversatión# Let no one **deceive** you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not **be** partakers with them; for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; **walk** as children of Light (for the fruit of the Light *consists* in all goodness and righteousness and truth), trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. Do not **participate** in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even **expose** them; for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. For this reason it says, “**Awake**, sleeper, And **arise** from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.” Conclusion\u0026hellip;by means of the Spirit# Therefore **be careful** how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, making the most of your time, because the days are evil. So then do not **be** foolish, but **understand** what the will of the Lord is. And do not **get drunk** with wine, for that is dissipation, but be **filled** with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. 1. Wives# # Wives, *be subject* to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself *being* the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives *ought to be* to their husbands in everything. 2. Husbands# # Husbands, **love** your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also *does* the church, because we are members of His body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to **love** his own wife even as himself, and the wife must *see to it* that she respects her husband. 3. Children# # Children, **obey** your parents in the Lord, for this is right. **Honor** your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth. 4. Fathers# # Fathers, do not **provoke** your children **to anger**, but **bring** them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. 5. Slaves# # Slaves, be **obedient** to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. 6. Masters# # And masters, **do** the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. I. Amor of God# Finally, be **strong** in the Lord and in the strength of His might. **Put on** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness in the heavenly *places.* Therefore, **take up** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. **Stand** firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil *one.* And **take** the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. J. Prayer Requested# With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and *pray* on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, K.

      "content":"Gálatas 1:6-10# Gal 1:6 Me maravillo de que tan pronto ustedes hayan abandonado a Aquel que los llamó por la gracia de Cristo, para seguir un evangelio diferente,\nGal 1:7 que en realidad no es otro evangelio, sino que hay algunos que los perturban a ustedes y quieren pervertir el evangelio de Cristo.\nGal 1:8 Pero si aun nosotros, o un ángel del cielo, les anunciara otro evangelio contrario al que les hemos anunciado, sea anatema.\nGal 1:9 Como hemos dicho antes, también repito ahora: Si alguien les anuncia un evangelio contrario al que recibieron, sea anatema.\nGal 1:10 Porque ¿busco ahora el favor de los hombres o el de Dios? ¿O me esfuerzo por agradar a los hombres? Si yo todavía estuviera tratando de agradar a los hombres, no sería siervo de Cristo.\n====\nMe maravillo maravillo: [θαυμάζω],asombrado, mirar con admiración, sorprendido ​\tde que\n​\ttan pronto\nustedes hayan abandonado abandonado: [μετατίθημι], transportado, traspasado, apartarse\n​\ta Aquel (Dios)\n​\tque los llamó\n​\tpor la gracia de Cristo,\npara seguir\n​\tun evangelio diferente,\n​\tque\n​\ten realidad\n​\tno es otro\n​\tevangelio,\nsino que hay\n​\talgunos\n​\tque los perturban perturban:ταράσσω, atemorizar,agitar,batir hasta agitar, causar una conmoción interna, quitarle la calma mental, perturbar su ecuanimidad ​\ta ustedes\n​\ty quieren pervertir pervertir: μεταστρέφω, corromper,distorcionar ​\tel evangelio de Cristo. No es que negaban la obra de Cristo, pero negaban la suficienca de la obra de Cristo. Decian que Cristo habia hecho su parte y ahora era necesario que ellos hicieran su parte. Al hacerlo se separaron de Dios. Si, Aquel Dios que tan fervientemente predicaban.\nPero\n​\tsi aun (cualquiera de)\n​\tnosotros,\n​\to un ángel\n​\tdel cielo,\n​\tles anunciara otro evangelio\n​\tcontrario\n​\tal que les hemos anunciado,\n​\tsea anatema. anatema:ἀνάθεμα, 1) específicamente, una ofrenda resultante de un voto, que después de ser consagrada a un dios se colgaba en las paredes o columnas del templo, o se colocaba en algún otro lugar visible. 2) una cosa consagrada a Dios sin esperanza de ser redimida, y si es un animal, para ser sacrificado; por lo tanto, una persona o cosa destinada a la destrucción Este sigue siendo un criterio muy importante. Si escuchas a alguien decir algo acerca de la Biblia, no te dejes impresionar por la persona que habla, sino escucha lo que dice. El contenido de su predicación tiene que encajar con lo que dice la Biblia y tú tienes la responsabilidad de probarlo. El evangelio puro no tolera nada a su lado. Es completo, absoluto y definitivo. Nada se puede mezclar con él y nada se puede agregar.\nComo hemos dicho\n​\tantes,\ntambién repito\n​\tahora:\nSi alguien (cualquiera)\n​\tles anuncia\n​\tun evangelio\n​\tcontrario contrario: παρά,en contra,desviado, en violación a, o posiblemente más que han recibido\n​\tal que recibieron, habian oido el evangelio claro para ser salvos.\n​\tsea anatema. anatema:ἀνάθεμα Porque\n​\t¿busco ahora el favor busco favor: πείθω, hacer amigo, convencer, persuadir ​\tde los hombres\n​\to\n​\tel de Dios?\n​\t¿O me esfuerzo esfuerzo: ζητέω, buscando, tratando,anhelar, exigir algo de alguien ​\tpor agradar agradar: ἀρέσκω, agradar, adaptarse a las opiniones, deseos e intereses de los demás\n​\ta los hombres? Interesantemente, esto es exactamente lo que Pablo era como incrédulo. Gal 1:13 Porque ustedes han oído acerca de mi antigua manera de vivir en el judaísmo, de cuán desmedidamente perseguía yo a la iglesia de Dios y trataba de destruirla. Gal 1:14 Yo aventajaba en el judaísmo a muchos de mis compatriotas contemporáneos, mostrando mucho más celo por las tradiciones de mis antepasados. Si yo\n​\ttodavía estuviera tratando\n​\tde agradar agradar: ἀρέσκω, ​\ta los hombres,\n​\t(yo) no sería siervo\n​\tde Cristo. 1 Tes 2:4, 6, 1 Cor 2:4\n"},{

La fe es contrastado al orgulloso.\nI. El orgullo está en todas partes y toma todo tipo de formas.\n• Aquí está el rico, orgulloso de lo que tiene\n• Está el pobre, orgulloso de su “honra” al tener menos\n• Aquí está el hombre talentoso, orgulloso de lo que puede hacer\n• Está el hombre de pocos talentos, orgulloso de su arduo trabajo\n• Aquí está el hombre religioso, orgulloso de su religión\n• Está el incrédulo, orgulloso de su incredulidad\n• Aquí está el hombre establecido, orgulloso de su lugar en la sociedad\n• Está el hombre contracultural, orgulloso de su condición de “marginado”\n• Aquí está el sabio, orgulloso de su inteligencia y saber\n• Aquí está el hombre sencillo, orgulloso de su sencillez (David Guzik)\nIV. Antes de su audaz declaración de la verdad del evangelio, Martín Lutero era un monje agustino. Como monje peregrinó a Roma y al cruzar los Alpes cayó gravemente enfermo. Mientras yacía enfermo sintió una gran conmoción, tanto física como espiritual, y le vino a la mente un versículo que antes le había conmovido: El justo por su fe vivirá, de Hab 2,4. Cuando Lutero se recuperó, se fue a Roma e hizo las cosas de turista que hacían todos los peregrinos. Un día llegó a la iglesia de San Juan de Letrán, donde hay una escalera que se dice que es del salón del juicio de Pilato. Era costumbre de los peregrinos subir esta escalera, pero nunca de pie, subían dolorosamente un escalón a la vez de rodillas, rezando y besando los escalones donde se creía que había caído la sangre de Jesús. Lutero llegó a este lugar y comenzó a hacer lo mismo que todos los peregrinos, porque el Papa prometió una indulgencia a todos los que subieran los escalones de rodillas y rezaran. Mientras hacía esto, Lutero recordó las palabras de Habacuc: El justo por su fe vivirá. Se dice que cuando recordó esto se detuvo, se puso de pie, caminó y se fue directamente a su casa en Alemania. Algunos dicen que la Reforma comenzó en esas escaleras.\nv. “Antes de que estas palabras vinieran a mi mente, yo odiaba a Dios y estaba enojado con él porque, no contento con asustarnos a los pecadores con la ley y con las miserias de la vida, aumentó aún más nuestra tortura con el evangelio. Pero cuando, por el Espíritu de Dios, entendí aquellas palabras: “¡El justo por la fe vivirá!”, “¡El justo por la fe vivirá!”, entonces me sentí nacido de nuevo como un hombre nuevo; Entré por las puertas abiertas al mismísimo Paraíso de Dios”. (Lutero)\nvi. Estamos llamados a vivir por fe, y nada más.\n• Algunos cristianos viven por devociones\n• Algunos cristianos viven por obras\n• Algunos cristianos viven por sentimientos\n• Algunos cristianos viven según las circunstancias (David Guzik)\nFe habla del objeto no del valor, cantidad o cualidad de ella. La fe implica la mirada puesta en algo. Definimos ese algo como el Sr. Jesucristo.\n"},{

All of these men are young.\n2. How long, Lord, have I called for help, And You do not hear? Habakkuk's complaint is that God is not listening I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save. Violence! And you don't do anything!? This may be a clue as to the time period. Perhaps it fits best after king Josiah when Jehoiakim (puppet king) is placed as king by Egypt. He was a very bad king (Jer 36). Gave taxes to Egypt and had the prophet Uriah killed (Jer 26:21-24).\n3 Why do You make me see disaster, And make *me* look at destitution? Yes, devastation and violence are before me; Habakkuk seems to be blaming God for these circumstances-YOU make me see, YOU make me look. Perhaps Habakkuk saw what influence Nahum and Zephaniah had on young king Josiah yet Habakkuk evidently has a very hard time with Jehoiakim. Jeremiah, a contemporary is already under caution. Jer 22:17. Jehoiakim burns a part of Jeremiah's scroll (Jer 26:20-23) Strife exists and contention arises. The world system and lack of justice really can get frustrating.\n4 Therefore the Law is ignored, And justice is never upheld. For the wicked surround the righteous; Therefore justice comes out confused. Habakkuk seems to blame the lack of justice because of strife and contention. Since the wicked surround the righteous, the law is ignored, justice is never upheld. God Responds# 5 “Look among the nations! Habakkuk is invited to look outside of his 4 walls to see God was still in charge.\nWatch! Be horrified! Be frightened speechless! For I am accomplishing a work It was ongoing, God was already in the process\nin your days—You would not believe it even if you were told! It was so extraordinary, it was unbelievable\n6 For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans, This is ironic. Is God 'teaming up' with the evil Chaldeans? Up to this point, the Chaldeans weren't a super power. This had been prophecied: Isa 23:13, Deut 28:49-57 That grim and impetuous people grim and impetuous is just the opposite to who God is\nWho march throughout the earth, To take possession of dwelling places that are not theirs. These aren't people who stick to their own. They go where others dwell and rob it. Bullies 7 They are terrifying and feared; What was known of the Chaldeans was fearful. Terrorists\nTheir justice and authority originate with themselves. They do not acquire their justice from God. They establish their own. A strange form of justice of of their own. 8 Their horses are faster than leopards, And quicker than wolves in the evening. Their horsemen charge along, Their horsemen come from afar; They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour. 9 All of them come for violence. Their horde of faces moves forward. They gather captives like sand. 10 They make fun of kings, And dignitaries are *an object of* laughter to them. They laugh at every fortress, Then heap up dirt and capture it. 11 Then they fly along *like* the wind and pass on. Fast, stealthy, violent, oppressive, smart, undefeatable\nBut they will be held guilty, They whose strength is their god.” Their strength is their god. They worship their strength. They are only as strong as their strength. Yet it is God will ultimately see justice done - they will be held guilty. Habakkuk Questions God\u0026rsquo;s Response# 12 Are You not from time everlasting, Lord, God is eternal\nmy God, my Holy One? Habakkuk's God. Intimate. Habakkuk's righteousness is God\nWe will not die. God's promise then and now is for eternal life\nYou, Lord, have appointed them to *deliver* judgment; God is sovereign. He devises his plan, establishes it and it is carried out.\nAnd You, O Rock, have destined them to punish. 13 *Your* eyes are too pure to look at evil, And You cannot look at harm *favorably*. Why do You look *favorably* At those who deal treacherously? *Why* are You silent when the wicked swallow up Those more righteous than they? humanly speaking this does not seem to be the way God would operate. God is holy and pure, why would He treat the Chaldeans favourably?\n14 *Why* have You made people like the fish of the sea, Like crawling things that have no ruler over them? 15 *The Chaldeans* bring all of them up with a hook, Drag them away with their net, And gather them together in their fishing net. Therefore they rejoice and are joyful. 16 Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net And burn incense to their fishing net, Because through these things their catch is large, And their food is plentiful. 17 Will they therefore empty their net, And continually slay nations without sparing? Their condemnation is just. Why are you teaming up with them?\nGod Explains to Habakkuk# 1 I will stand at my guard post And station myself on the watchtower; And I will keep watch to see what He will say to me, And how I may reply when I am reprimanded. 2 Then the Lord answered me and said, “Write down the vision\tAnd inscribe *it* clearly on tablets, So that one who reads it may run. God wants to be understood (write it clearly). In this case, those who read it, by faith must run! God has written His word in a clear way so that whoever reads it can understand what God is doing and by faith trust him. Today He has not called us to run specifically but we are to go and make disciples of all the nations! 3 For the vision is yet for the appointed time; It hurries toward the goal and it will not fail. Though it delays, wait for it; For it will certainly come, it will not delay *long*. A. WOE to the ARROGANT God reminds Habakkuk that righteousness is God's to declare, God gives woes against people with the wrong heart not based on the group they belong to# 4 “Behold, as for the impudent one, His soul is not right within him; But the righteous one will live by his faith. Judah is to live by faith, to run. Those by faith, who are declared righteous also are to walk by faith.\n5 Furthermore, wine betrays an arrogant man, So that he does not achieve his objective. He enlarges his appetite like Sheol, And he is like death, never satisfied. He also gathers to himself all the nations And collects to himself all the peoples. the arrogance of the Chaldeans will not go unnoticed\n6 “Will all of these not take up a song of ridicule against him, Even a saying *and* insinuations against him And say, ‘**Woe** to him who increases what is not his— For how long— And makes himself rich with debts!’ 7 Will your creditors not rise up suddenly, And those who collect from you awaken? Indeed, **you** will become plunder for them. 8 Since **you** have looted many nations, All the rest of the peoples will loot you— Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitants. WOE to the GREEDY# 9 “**Woe** to him who makes evil profit for his household, To put his nest on high, To be saved from the hand of catastrophe! 10 You have planned a shameful thing for your house By bringing many peoples to an end; So you are sinning against yourself. 11 For the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework. WOE to the VIOLENT# 12 “**Woe** to him who builds a city with bloodshed, And founds a town with violence! 13 Is it not indeed from the Lord of armies That peoples labor *merely* for fire, And nations become weary for nothing? 14 For the earth will be filled With the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, As the waters cover the sea. WOE to the IMMORAL# 15 “**Woe** to him who makes his neighbor drink; To you who mix in your venom even to make *your neighbors* drunk, So as to look at their genitalia! 16 You will be filled with disgrace rather than honor. Drink, you yourself, and expose your *own* foreskin! The cup in the Lord’s right hand will come around to you, And utter disgrace *will come* upon your glory. 17 For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, And the devastation of *its* animals by which you terrified them, Because of human bloodshed and violence done to the land, To the town and all its inhabitant WOE to the IDOLATER# 18 “What benefit is a carved image when its maker has carved it, Or* a cast metal image, a teacher of falsehood? For *its* maker trusts in his *own* handiwork When he fashions speechless idols. 19 **Woe** to him who says to a *piece of* wood, ‘Awake!’ To a mute stone, ‘Arise!’ That is *your* teacher? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, Yet there is no breath at all inside it. The idolator places his trust in his own handiwork. This is his instructor, a mute teacher of falsehood.\nGod is the only righteous# 20 But the Lord is in His holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before Him.” Righteousness is not one nation more than another (ie Judah vs Babylon). Righteousness and holiness is only God. Let everyone else be silent\nHabakkuk Settles to Focus on God and His faithfulness over time# **3** A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth. 2 Lord, I have heard the report about You, *and* I was afraid. `the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom` Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make *it* known. In anger remember mercy. 3 God comes from Teman, And the Holy One from Mount Paran. *Selah* His splendor covers the heavens, And the earth is full of His praise. 4 *His* radiance is like the sunlight; He has rays *flashing* from His hand, And the hiding of His might is there. 5 Before Him goes plague, And plague comes forth after Him. 6 He stood and caused the earth to shudder; He looked and caused the nations to jump. Yes, the everlasting mountains were shattered, The ancient hills collapsed. His paths are everlasting. 7 I saw the tents of Cushan under distress, The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling. Attributes of God: Holy One, Splendor covers the heavens, praised by the whole earth, radiant, mighty, plague goes before and after, powerful - causing the earth to tremble, everlasting\n8 Did the Lord rage against the rivers, Or *was* Your anger against the rivers, Or *was* Your rage against the sea, That You rode on Your horses, On Your chariots of salvation? 9 You removed Your bow *from its holder*, The arrows of *Your* word were sworn. *Selah* You divided the earth with rivers. 10 The mountains saw You *and* quaked; The downpour of waters swept by. The deep raised its voice, It lifted high its hands. 11 Sun *and* moon stood in their lofty places; They went away at the light of Your arrows, At the radiance of Your flashing spear. 12 In indignation You marched through the earth; In anger You trampled the nations. God manifested his power and justice. Perhaps the flood is alluded to.\n13 You went forth for the salvation of Your people, For the salvation of Your anointed. You smashed the head of the house of evil To uncover *him from* foot to neck. *Selah* 14 **You** pierced with his own arrows The head of his leaders. They stormed in to scatter us; Their arrogance *was* like those Who devour the oppressed in secret. 15 **You** trampled on the sea with Your horses, On the foam of many waters. Habakkuk recounts God's faithfulness and mercy to Israel over the years. In anger, God remembered mercy. Habakkuk\u0026rsquo;s interaction with God results in Life experience# 16 I heard, and (Hab 1:6) - Habakkuk had heard. God spoke, he listened. my inner parts trembled; At the sound, my lips quivered. Decay enters my bones, And in my place I tremble; Because I must wait quietly This was a scary thought for Habakkuk. It meant imminent trouble was coming. They would need to trust the Lord for the day of distress, For the people The nation was in for distress.\nto arise *who* will attack us. God was going to raise up the Chaldeans to attack Judah. 17 Even if the fig tree does not blossom, And there is no fruit on the vines, *If* the yield of the olive fails, And This meant not only no olives but no produce of the olive (oil etc). the fields produce no food, *Even if* No figs, no grapes, no olives the flock disappears from the fold, And there are no cattle in the stalls, even if...there's no sheep or cattle\n18 Yet I will triumph in the Lord, I will rejoice Triumph is secured in the Lord. I can rejoice!\nin the God of my salvation. 19 The Lord God is my strength, He can rejoice in the God of his salvation. God is his strength And He has made my feet like deer’s *feet*, And has me walk on my high places. Feet like deer is to be firm. Similar to a tree planted by the water. high is above danger, lofty places. Background of Habakkuk# Date of writing: about 609-605 B.C.\n​\tIn 620 B.C.E., revolts throughout the Assyrian Empire gave the Chaldeans the distraction they needed to take over Babylon.\n​\tIn 612 B.C. Ninevah is destroyed\n​\tThe Chaldeans had finally become a regional power.1\nCircumstances: Jehoiakim is King (609-598). He is 25 when placed in power.\nSeveral prophets: Jeremiah is young, Zephaniah and Zechariah are young and so is Habakkuk.\n(https://study.com/academy/lesson/the-chaldeans-definition-history-culture.html )\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{

When he ascended the throne as Thothmes II, his sister Hatshepsut became regent and actually ruled the country. Thothmes II eventually died without a legitimate heir, but because both his father and sister had foreseen this lack of a successor, they probably had determined long beforehand that Moses would be the eventual heir. So from earliest years Moses had been educated with this in mind, as Stephen declares: “Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds” (Acts 7:22).\nWhen her brother died, it appears that Hatshepsut retained supreme authority as regent in Egypt and indicated her intention of placing Moses, her adopted son, on the throne as her successor. To legitimize this, she had planned to marry Moses to her elder daughter, Nepherus. Moses, however, apparently both refused the throne and the bride, and thus sacrificed his position in the kingdom and the honor and the wealth that went with it.\nJ. Dwight Pentecost and Kenneth M. Durham, Faith That Endures, rev. ed. (Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel, 2000), 188–189.

      "content":"Identificando la Cosmovisión del Calvinismo# El Calvinismo o teología reformada viene a sistemizarse por algunos seguidores de Juan Calvino. Los orígenes y desarrollo del Calvinismo son explicados en detalle en otros lugares y no tomaremos espacio para explicarlo aquí.\nCuando decimos el Calvinismo es idolatría estamos hablando de lo que es la teología reformada y no es nuestra intención atacar al calvinista. Al contrario, nuestro deseo es demostrar el error de lo que enseña la teología reformada y si es posible salvar al calvinista de su error.\nUsaremos 5 principios para demostrar una cosmovisión anti-bíblica enseñados por Nancy Pearcey.\nIndentificar el ídolo del Calvinismo Tal vez suena extraño sugerir que el Calvinismo y la idolatría vayan conectados. Especialmente dado que el Calvinismo siempre se pronuncia como bíblico y siempre cita muchos versículos para sostener sus posición. ¿Porque entonces proponemos que el Calvinismo es en realidad idolatría?\nLos primeros dos mandamientos prohiben la creación de falsos dioses. No son dioses en realidad, no existen pero son hechuras, imaginadas del hombre. No son dioses reales.\nEn este sentido siempre pensamos en crear dioses falsos. Pero que si creamos un dios falso? ¿No es lo mismo? Si alteramos el carácter y naturaleza del Dios de la Biblia, terminamos creando un dios según nuestra propia imaginación. El Calvinismo es culpable de crear un dios que contiene aspectos del Dios de la Biblia pero no es el mismo.\n¿Como crea el Calvinismo a su propio dios?\nEl dios calvinista no es justo El dios imaginario del calvinismo dice que para que su dios se manifieste como bueno, requiere que haya maldad en el mundo. Agustin lo explicó de esta manera, \u0026ldquo;Y así los males, que Dios no ama, no están fuera del orden; y sin embargo ama el orden mismo. Esto mismo ama: amar las cosas buenas y no amar las cosas malas, y esto mismo es una cosa de orden magnífico y de disposición divina. Y debido a que este arreglo ordenado mantiene la armonía del universo por este mismo contraste, resulta que las cosas malas tienen que ser. De este modo, la belleza de todas las cosas se configura, por así decirlo, a partir de antítesis, es decir, de opuestos: esto nos agrada incluso en el discurso.\u0026rdquo; El dios del calvinismo no es absolutamente santo La Biblia hace claro que Yahveh odia el pecado. El intrinsico a su naturaleza. Sin embargo el dios hechizo del calvinismo dice que el es el autor del pecado pero que al final será justificado. El dios calvinista no amó al mundo entero El dios ficticio que enseña el calvinismo depende de la reprobación para que su dios se muestre benevolente a los que escogió, primero tiene que existir los que son reprovados. Esto es completamente contrario al Dios de la Biblia que creo todo muy bien y para harmonizar con toda su bondad. Identificar el reduccionismo del Calvinismo\nEl reduccionismo es el concepto de tomar una doctrina bíblica y reducirla, resumirla a una declaración finita que muy bien podría ser una simplificación excesiva. Peor que eso, el reduccionismo puede ignorar todo el consejo de la Palabra de Dios a favor de un pasaje. La enseñanza calvinista es un excelente ejemplo de esto. Pon a prueba el ídolo: ¿contradice lo que sabemos sobre el mundo?\nPon a prueba el ídolo: ¿Se contradice a sí mismo?\nReemplazar el ídolo: defender el cristianismo bíblico\n"},{

Mark 8:32 And He was stating the matter plainly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.\nHe stated it plainly...there's no mistaking it's fully literal fulfillment. There were living witnesses to prove it. The man Jesus rose after three days# 500+ witnesses.\n1 Corinthians 15:3-6 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;\n500 witness of which most were still alive (they could go and confirm). Two resurrections# Daniel 12:2 \u0026ldquo;Many of those who sleep in the dust of the ground will awake, these to everlasting life, but the others to disgrace and everlasting contempt.\nTwo Options: everlasting life and everlasting disgrace and contempt\n1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words.\nIf we believe is the only condition\nWhich resurrection will you be part of?# You and I will be part of one of these resurrections. Do you know at this point which resurrection you are part of?\nDeath eternal# Revevelation 20:12 And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books, according to their deeds.\nIF they're judged according to their deeds then they have no chance\nLife eternal# John 5:24 \u0026ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.\nTHOSE who believe are exempted from judgment and gifted eternal life based on hearing his word and believing Him...\nWhat does it mean to believe?# The NT makes it clear, the only condition for receiving eternal life, promised hereafter, life after death is by believing. Yet what does it mean to believe?\nIs there false belief vs true belief?\nCould it be about the amount of faith? The kind of faith?\nRomans 4:5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,\nClearly, faith is NOT about working since believing is counterposed with works in this verse. Yet, clearly it\u0026rsquo;s not faith in faith or faith in oneself. It is faith placed specifically \u0026lsquo;in Him who justifies the ungodly\u0026rsquo;.\nThis is believing\u0026hellip;\nYOU can KNOW!# 1 John 5:13 These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.\nJohn 3:18 \u0026ldquo;He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.\n"},{

Joseph and his family moved to Egypt 215 years after the promise is given to Abram.\nDifferent dates given# Then the Lord said to Abram, “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for 400 years.” (Genesis 15:13)\nThe time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430 years. At the end of 430 years, on that very day, all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. (Exodus 12:40–41)\nAnd God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them 400 years. (Acts 7:6)\nNow the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ. This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void (Galatians 3:16–17)\nExplanation\n430 - From the promise given to Abram to the departure (to the day) was 430 years. The nations began with Abram. This is when Abram first lived in Egypt. God makes the promise to Abram and he leaves Haran. Genesis 12:2\nExo 12:41 And at the end of four hundred and thirty years, to the very day, all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\n400 - The \u0026ldquo;affliction\u0026rdquo; to the nation began when Ishmael, son of Hagar the Egyptian, mocked and persecuted Isaac.

      "content":"Juan 2:23-24# Muchos creyeron en su nombre\u0026hellip; Creyeron que él era el Mesías prometido , pero no creen en él para la salvación de sus almas: porque encontramos, del siguiente versículo, que sus corazones no fueron en absoluto cambiados , porque nuestro bendito Señor no pudo confiar en ellos. - adam Clark\nmuchos creyeron en su nombre ; que era un gran profeta, o el profeta, o el Mesías; Le dieron un asentimiento histórico a él como tal, al menos por ese tiempo: - John Gill\n23. Muchos creyeron. El evangelista conecta apropiadamente esta narrativa con la primera. Cristo no había dado tal señal como exigían los judíos; y ahora, cuando no produjo un buen efecto en ellos por muchos milagros, excepto que ellos mantuvieron una fe fría, que era solo la sombra de la fe, este evento prueba suficientemente que no merecían que él cumpliera con sus deseos. Fue, de hecho, un fruto de los signos, que muchos creyeron en Cristo, y en su nombre, para profesar que deseaban seguir su doctrina; porque el nombre se pone aquí por autoridad. Esta apariencia de fe, que hasta ahora era infructuosa, podría ser transformada en verdadera fe y podría ser una preparación útil para celebrar el nombre de Cristo entre otros; y, sin embargo, lo que hemos dicho es cierto, que estaban lejos de tener los sentimientos adecuados, para beneficiarse de las obras de Dios, como deberían haberlo hecho.\nSin embargo, esta no era una fe pretendida por la cual deseaban ganarse reputación entre los hombres; porque estaban convencidos de que Cristo era un gran Profeta, y tal vez incluso le atribuyeron el honor de ser el Mesías, de quien había en ese momento una expectativa fuerte y general. Pero como no entendían el oficio peculiar del Mesías, su fe era absurda, porque estaba dirigida exclusivamente al mundo y las cosas terrenales. También era una creencia fría, y no estaba acompañado por los verdaderos sentimientos del corazón. Para los hipócritas que asienten al Evangelio, no para que puedan dedicarse a la obediencia a Cristo, ni para que con piedad sincera puedan seguir a Cristo cuando los llama, sino porque no se aventuran a rechazar por completo la verdad que han conocido, y especialmente cuando no pueden encontrar ninguna razón para oponerse. Porque como no hacen voluntariamente, o por su propia voluntad, hacen la guerra con Dios, de modo que cuando perciben que su doctrina se opone a su carne y a sus deseos perversos, se ofenden de inmediato, o al menos se retiran de la fe que creen. Ya se había abrazado.\nCuando el evangelista dice, por lo tanto, que esos hombres creyeron, no entiendo que falsificaron una fe que no existía, sino que de alguna manera estaban obligados a inscribirse como seguidores de Cristo; y, sin embargo, parece que su fe no era verdadera y genuina, porque Cristo los excluye del número de aquellos en quienes se puede confiar. Además, esa fe dependía únicamente de los milagros, y no tenía raíces en el Evangelio, y por lo tanto no podía ser estable o permanente. Los milagros ayudan a los hijos de Dios a llegar a la verdad; pero no equivale a creer de verdad, cuando admiran el poder de Dios simplemente para creer que es verdad, pero no para someterse totalmente a él. Y, por lo tanto, cuando hablamos en general sobre la fe, háganos saber que hay un tipo de fe que solo se percibe por la comprensión, y luego desaparece rápidamente, porque no está fijada en el corazón; y esa es la fe que James llama muerto; pero la verdadera fe siempre depende del Espíritu de regeneración, (Santiago 2:17 .) Observe que no todos obtienen el mismo beneficio de las obras de Dios; porque algunos son guiados por ellos a Dios, y otros solo son impulsados por un impulso ciego, de modo que, aunque perciben de hecho el poder de Dios, todavía no dejan de vagar en su propia imaginación. - Juan Calvino\n23-25 Nuestro Señor conocía a todos los hombres, su naturaleza, sus disposiciones, sus afectos, sus designios, como nosotros no conocemos a ningún hombre, ni siquiera a nosotros mismos. Conoce a sus astutos enemigos, y todos sus proyectos secretos; a sus falsos amigos, y sus verdaderos caracteres. Sabe quiénes son verdaderamente suyos, conoce su rectitud y conoce sus debilidades. Nosotros sabemos lo que hacen los hombres; Cristo conoce lo que hay en ellos, prueba el corazón. Cuídate de una fe muerta, o de una profesión formal: los profesantes carnales y vacíos no son de fiar, y por más que los hombres se impongan a los demás o a sí mismos, no pueden imponerse al Dios que busca el corazón. - Matthew Henry\nSon posibles dos interpretaciones para estos versículos.\nEl primero ve esto como la refutación más completa de aquellos que piensan que la gente creerá debido a los milagros que podríamos tener. Eso es lo que hicieron estas personas, dice este punto de vista, creyeron en Él porque vieron milagros. Pero Jesús sabía cuán poco confiable era esa fe, y que la única fe que vale la pena tener es la que se basa en una certeza interna de Quién es Jesús y una respuesta completa a Él basada en esa certeza. - Peter Prett\nLos milagros que Él obró convencieron a muchos en cuanto a su entendimiento natural. Sin duda fue sinceramente; sino una conclusión humana justa. Pero ahora se abre otra verdad. El hombre, en su estado natural, [16] era realmente incapaz de recibir las cosas de Dios; no es que el testimonio fuera insuficiente para convencerlo, ni que él nunca fue convencido: muchos lo fueron en este momento; pero Jesús no se comprometió con ellos. John Darby\nFuente: El Tesoro del Conocimiento Bíblico# muchos creyeron en su nombre: El propósito de Juan al registrar los milagros de Jesús era para que las personas creyeran y tuvieran vida eterna (Jua 20:30, Jua 20:31). Hay quienes han llegado a la conclusión que, aunque el texto dice que el pueblo creyó, no tenía fe verdadera. Puesto que su fe solamente se basaba en los milagros de Cristo, dicen que no era una fe que salva. Además, afirman que Cristo no se comprometió con ellos (v. Jua 2:24); sin embargo, Juan dice que registró los milagros de Cristo para que el pueblo creyera y tuviera vida eterna (Jua 20:30, Jua 20:31). El texto dice también que ellos «creyeron en», una construcción que en todas partes del NT. indica fe que salva. Es más, creyeron en su nombre, una frase que solamente se usa dos veces más en el Evangelio de Juan y en ambos lugares se trata de la fe que salva (Jua 1:12; Jua 3:18).\n"},{

      "content":"La Iglesia# Artículo Originál # # # # # ¿Qué es la Iglesia?# Su función y propósito según la Biblia# I. ¿Qué es la Iglesia?# La palabra “Iglesia” en griego es EKKLESIA. EK que significa fuera, o fuera de, y KALEO significa llamar. Aparece 117 veces en el Nuevo Testamento.# Literalmente significa \u0026ldquo;asamblea\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;congregación\u0026rdquo; o \u0026ldquo;reunión\u0026rdquo;. Hechos 19:39-40# En el Antiguo Testamento se usaba un término similar para referirse a experiencias como “el día de la asamblea”, “la congregación” o “reunión”. Deuteronomio 9:10, 2 Crónicas 7:8, Salmo 107:32# Así que, cuando Jesús declara: “Edificaré mi EKKLESIA” (Mateo 16:18), no resultó algo desconocido para el oyente común.# Poco después, en el Nuevo Testamento, la palabra con el artículo definido (ΤΕΝ EKKLESIA - la iglesia), se limita estrictamente a referirse a la congregación de creyentes en Jesucristo. Hechos 14:27# La palabra EKKLESIA nunca se usa refiriendose a una sinagoga, templo, capilla, tabernáculo, edificio o cualquier otro lugar de reunión como “iglesia”. 1 Corintios 1:2, 2 Corintios 1:1, Gálatas 1:2, Filemón 1:2# II. La Naturaleza de la Iglesia# La iglesia es poseción de Jesucristo, regalo del Padre (Juan 6:39), comprado mediante la obra de Cristo. Hechos 20:28# Tengan cuidado de sí mismos y de toda la congregación\u0026hellip;la cual Él [Cristo] compró con Su propia sangre. Hechos 20:28\nLa iglesia es compuesta de \u0026ldquo;hijos de Dios\u0026rdquo;. Todo el que cree en Jesucristo como salvador llega a ser parte de la iglesia. Juan 1:12, 1 Juan 3:1# \u0026ldquo;Así pues, ustedes ya no son extraños ni extranjeros, sino que son conciudadanos de los santos y son de la familia de Dios\u0026rdquo;. Efesios 2:19\n\u0026ldquo;pero en caso que me tarde, te escribo para que sepas cómo debe conducirse uno en la casa de Dios, que es la iglesia del Dios vivo, columna y sostén de la verdad\u0026rdquo;. 1 Timoteo 3:15\nEl énfasis de la metáfora \u0026ldquo;cuerpo de Cristo\u0026rdquo; está en la unión de Cristo y la iglesia y entre los propios creyentes, algo indispensable para comprender cómo funciona la iglesia bajo la autoridad de Jesucristo. 1 Corintios 12:13, Juan 14:20# III. ¿Cual es la visión de Cristo para Su Iglesia?# Jesús declaró que edificar la iglesia seria algo que Él haría personalmente. Él dijo: “Edificaré mi iglesia” (Mateo 16:18).# 1. La visión de Jesucristo es ver a Su iglesia - cuerpo y esposa de Cristo - completa. Mateo 16:18, 28:19-20; Romanos 11:25# 2. El libro de Apocalipsis dice que el cuerpo de Cristo no sólo se completará, sino que será compuesto de gente de toda tribu, lengua, y nación. Apocalipsis 5:9# IV. ¿Cuál es la misión de la Iglesia?# La responsabilidad ministerial de la iglesia local recae sobre los miembros en su conjunto. A medida que los miembros identifican sus dones y asumen la responsabilidad de administrarlos bajo la dirección del Espíritu Santo, la iglesia aumenta su capacidad para bendecir y cumplir su misión en la tierra. 1 Pedro 4:10# La VISION de Cristo es \u0026ldquo;edificaré mi iglesia\u0026rdquo;.# La MANERA que Cristo edifica su Iglesia es la Gran Comisión. Mateo 28:18-20# V. La Grán Comisión# Vayan, pues, y hagan discípulos de todas las naciones, bautizándolos en el nombre del Padre y del Hijo y del Espíritu Santo, enseñándoles a guardar todo lo que les he mandado\u0026hellip;» Mateo 28:19-20\nEl mayor desafío que la iglesia enfrenta en cualquier generación, es lograr que las personas participen en el proceso de la replicación. Esto es especialmente difícil en ciertos círculos donde los maestros niegan que la Gran Comisión sea aplicable para hoy.# Sin la Gran Comisión no existe ímpetu bíblico para que las iglesias se reproduzcan. Si la iglesia de Jesucristo fracasa en reduplicarse así misma a través de un discipulado efectivo, las iglesias locales quedaran vacantes debido a la falta de agregar nuevos miembros al cuerpo de Cristo.# VI. La Gran Comisión contiene tres partes\u0026hellip;# 1. Evangelismo\u0026hellip;Marcos 16:15, 1 Cor 1:17, Hechos 14:21# 2. Discipulado\u0026hellip;Hechos 19:9, 2 Timoteo 2:2# 3. Enseñanza\u0026hellip;Hechos 4:18, Hechos 19:10, Hechos 6:2# Entonces, podemos resumir el propósito de la iglesia de la siguiente manera: Ir y Hacer hacedores de discipulos. Evangelizamos para llegar a discipular a los convertidos para enseñarles a ir y hacer lo mismo. 2 Timoteo 2:2# Una iglesia local que discipula tiene miembros firmes, motivados para participar en:# 1. Compartir el evangelio.# 2. Discipular a otros.# 3. Servir a la iglesia usando sus dones para bendecir al cuerpo.# 4. Ser de ayuda social a la comunidad# Al contrario\u0026hellip;una iglesia local que no discipula\u0026hellip;¡muere!# ¿Porque?# Porque el discipulado no es meramente un curso antes de ser bautisado, o las tradiciones de la iglesia que se pasan de generación en generación o mantener gente reunida en un local, sino que es el entrenamiento en el mensaje del evangelio con el propósito de que ellos puedan enseñar también a otros. Romanos 1:16, 1 Corintios 2:2, 2 Timoteo 2:2# Desde que Cristo encargo a 12 hombres para establecer Su Iglesia, se ha estado transmitiendo este mensaje de persona a persona, generación a generación. Jesus enseño a Pablo, Pablo a Timoteo, Timoteo a fieles y esos fieles a otros hasta llegar a nosotros hoy. 1 Corintios 15:1-4, 2 Timoteo 2:2# Una iglesia que no discipula muere porque a diferencia que uno puede nacer siendo budista o musulmán, nadie nace siendo cristiano. Debe nacer de nuevo. Juan 3:3, 1 Juan 5:1, 1 Pedro 1:23# A traves de los últimos 2000 años, La Iglesia se ha renovado completamente al menos unas 50 veces.# ¿Que pasará con nuestra generación? ¿Discipularemos el claro evangelio a la siguiente generación?# # VII. ¡Jesus quiere alcanzar al mundo entero en nuestra generación!# E indiscutiblemente, grande es el misterio de la piedad: Él fue manifestado en la carne, Vindicado en el Espíritu, Contemplado por ángeles, Proclamado entre las naciones, Creído en el mundo, Recibido arriba en gloria. 1 Timoteo 3:16\n"},{

Romanos 9:4, Éxodo 19-20, Salmos 147:19-20# Gálatas 3:19b La Ley\u0026hellip;Fue añadida a causa de las transgresiones,# La Ley fue agregada para el conocimiento de pecado. Romanos 7:7# Gálatas 3:19c \u0026hellip;hasta que viniera la descendencia a la cual había sido hecha la promesa,# El pacto mosaico fue sólo temporal. Al establecer la Ley bajo el Pacto Mosaico, Dios nunca abolió las promesas que había hecho anteriormente bajo el Pacto Abrahámico.# La Ley vino para un determinado tiempo \u0026ldquo;hasta que viniera la descendencia\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;# Gálatas 3:19d ley que fue promulgada mediante ángeles por mano de un mediador.# La ley fue dada por Dios, escrita en piedra, mediado por ángeles y Moises. 2 Corintios 3, Juan 1:17# Gálatas 3:20 Ahora bien, un mediador no representa a uno solo, pero Dios es uno solo.# La Ley demanda que el hombre cumpla sus obligaciones pero la promesa es Dios garantizando entregar todo sin ninguna asistencia de nadie.# Gálatas 3:21 ¿Es entonces la ley contraria a las promesas de Dios? ¡De ningún modo!# Gálatas 3:21a – Aunque la Ley y la promesa son sistemas diferentes, la Ley nunca fue contraria a las promesas de Dios. La Ley no anula ni contradice el Pacto Abrahamico. Pero debemos entender como encajan.# ¿Cómo podemos entender que La Ley no es para contradecir las promesas sino tiene otro propósito en relación a las promesas?# Gálatas 3:21b – Aun siendo buena como la Ley es, no puede impartir vida, ni en la justificación ni en la santificación. “\u0026hellip;porque si la ley dada pudiera vivificar, la justicia fuera verdaderamente por la ley”. Ver 1 Timoteo 1:8, Romanos 7:12# Gálatas 3:21c Porque si se hubiera dado una ley capaz de impartir vida, entonces la justicia ciertamente hubiera dependido de la ley.# El diseño de la ley nunca fue para dar vida. La Ley nunca tuvo como intención dar vida espiritual ni hacer justo a nadie.# Sin embargo, La Ley harmoniza de cierta manera con la gracia.# Gálatas 3:22a Pero la Escritura\u0026hellip; La Escritura aquí es usado sinonimamente con La Ley. Los Gálatas podrían caer culpables de mirar las Escrituras como el medio para vida, cuando en realidad no es su propósito tampoco.# Los fariseos escudriñaban las Escrituras pero no para descubrir a Cristo en ellos, sino para ver cómo podían ganar la vida eterna. Juan 5:39-40, Romanos 10:2-3# Gálatas 3:22b \u0026hellip;lo encerró todo bajo pecado, El propósito de las Escrituras era encerrar bajo pecado a todo el mundo. Santiago 2:10# La Ley provee el conocimiento y la convicción de pecado. Romanos 3:20# La Ley señala claramente el pecado. Romanos 5:20, Romanos 7:7# El ministerio de la ley es condenar al pecador. 2 Corintios 3:8-9# Gálatas 3:22c para que la promesa que es por la fe en Jesucristo fuera dada a todos los que creen. Hebreos 10:1# Gálatas 3:23 Antes de venir la fe, estábamos encerrados bajo la ley, confinados para la fe que había de ser revelada.# La Ley entrampó a los pecadores bajo juicio con la esperanza de que eventualmente llegaran a ver la respuesta en el evangelio de Cristo y creyeran. Romanos 11:32# Gálatas 3:24 De manera que la ley ha venido a ser nuestro guía para conducirnos a Cristo, a fin de que seamos justificados por la fe. Lucas 24:44# A pesar de que la Ley fue dada específicamente a Israel, Dios todavía la usa para preparar al mundo incredulo para ver su necesidad de un Salvador. Gálatas 3:24-26, Romanos 3:19-20# La Ley, como un guardián, tutor o mentor, fue utilizada por Dios para guiar a las personas a confiar en Jesucristo y, así, ser justificadas sólo por la fe en Cristo únicamente. Romanos 5:20# Gálatas 3:25 Pero ahora que ha venido la fe, ya no estamos bajo el guía.# Como un maestro llevaría a un niño a la escuela, la Ley lleva a las personas a Cristo para que puedan creer en Él.# Cuando alguien creía en Cristo, ya no debía estar bajo la supervisión de la Ley.# Aunque la Ley Mosaica es santa, justa y buena, no fue dada para santificar a los creyentes en la edad de la iglesia. Romanos 7:12, Gálatas 3:21# Gálatas 3:25b – Obviamente, la religión legalista basada en el esfuerzo humano no tiene lugar en la vida de aquellos que creen en Jesucristo. 1 Corintios 15:56# Gálatas 3:26 Pues todos ustedes son hijos de Dios mediante la fe en Cristo Jesús.# Gálatas 3:26 – ¡Gracias a lo que Jesucristo logró a nuestro favor, tenemos la increíble bendición de ser hijos de Dios! “\u0026hellip;todos sois hijos de Dios por la fe en Cristo Jesús”. Ver 1 Juan 3:1, Romanos 3:28# Nuestra posición en Cristo nos hizo hijos legítimos (HUIOI) y herederos de Dios, no simplemente descendientes (NEPIOS o TEKNA) de Dios sin derechos legales. 1 Pedro 1:3-4, Colosenses 1:12# Esta posición favorecida en Cristo fue obtenida en el momento en que creímos en Jesucristo como Salvador como parte de la promesa y no por ningún tipo de mérito. Romanos 6:15# Gálatas 3:27 Porque todos los que fueron bautizados en Cristo, de Cristo se han revestido.# Gálatas 3:27 – Tenemos la bendición de ser 100% aceptados en Cristo.# Gálatas 3:27a – En el momento de la salvación fuimos unidos con Cristo al ser bautizados en Él por medio del Espíritu Santo.# Consideremos la naturaleza superior de la promesa.# La promesa se basa en la gracia. Fue entregada originalmente a Abraham, un pecador indigno. ¡Él nunca jamás mereció la promesa; ni tampoco la merecemos nosotros! Gálatas 3:8# La ley fue temporal, pero la promesa fue permanente. La promesa no terminó en el Calvario, aunque el Calvario marcó el punto más alto de la promesa.# La connotación metafórica de este versículo es que ahora hemos sido vestidos con la ropa de una hija o un hijo maduro y plenamente aceptado y no con la ropa de niños inmaduros.# Los legalistas deben entender que todos los creyentes ya están cubiertos con ropa que los hace completamente aceptables a Dios.# Los legalistas necesitan saber que esta obra fue forjada por el Espíritu de Dios y no es el resultado de nuestros propios esfuerzos.# Gálatas 2:16 – La Ley no puede justificar a un pecador ante Dios. Romanos 8:3# Gálatas 3:10-11 – La Ley trae una maldición a aquellos que buscan ser justificados por ella.# Gálatas 3:2 – La Ley no puede otorgar el Espíritu Santo.# Gálatas 3:21 – La Ley no puede impartir vida (vida espiritual).# Gálatas 3:3 – La Ley no puede santificar (segunda fase de la salvación) al creyente.# Gálatas 5:18, 22-23 – La Ley no puede producir el fruto del Espíritu en la vida del creyente.# Romanos 8:3-4 – La Ley no puede producir justicia en la vida del creyente; es a través del Espíritu Santo que Dios produce en nosotros lo que la Ley nunca podría lograr.# Gálatas 2:11-13 - El legalismo produce divisiones e hipocresía, agradando al hombre.# Gálatas 2:14 – El legalismo es un ataque a la verdad del evangelio.# Gálatas 2:15 – El legalismo produce un espíritu enjuiciador.# Gálatas 2:16 – Una persona no es justificada por la Ley sino por gracia a través de la fe en Cristo.# Gálatas 2:17 – El legalismo hace que Cristo sea falsamente visto de alguna manera como causante de pecado.# Gálatas 2:18 – Mientras que el legalismo trata de reconstruir un viejo sistema de reglas y regulaciones, termina resultando en nuestro fracaso y pecado.# Gálatas 2:19 – No se supone que el cristiano viva bajo la ley (por legalismo) sino bajo la gracia. Sólo la gracia es capaz de dar lugar a una verdadera vida santa para la gloria de Dios. Romanos 6:14, Tito 2:11-13, Romanos 8:3-4# Gálatas 2:20 – En lugar de vivir por el legalismo, debemos vivir por fe en nuestra posición en Cristo que nos hizo muertos a nosotros mismos y vivos para Dios por el poder de Cristo en nosotros.# Gálatas 2:21 – Si los esfuerzos humanos derivados del legalismo pudieran producir un vivir justo, entonces Cristo murió innecesariamente.# Ahora el creyente no es guiado por La Ley, sino el Espíritu Santo. 1 Corintios 2:10, Mateo 22:29, 2 Corintios 3# Gálatas 3:3 – El Espíritu Santo y la carne (tus esfuerzos humanos) se muestran como polos opuestos. Gálatas 5:16-17, Gálatas 5:1# Gálatas 3:3 – La santificación no se basa en una combinación de esfuerzos humanos más las energías del Espíritu Santo. Vivir pensando de esta manera resulta en legalismo y frustración. Este era un problema de raíz del error gálata según Pablo.# "},{

      "content":"Romans 16:26 - Obedience of Faith# I would like to take a moment to look at the phrase obedience of faith.\nBefore we look at what it means, and since Paul mentions this phrase at the beginning and at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, we should look at his purpose for writing:\n``` So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. Romans 1:15``\nObedience is a noun not a verb. This is a term or definition, a title or description. It could describe the action or what results from the action.\n\u0026lsquo;But now\u0026rsquo; making a distinction to that what was previous not known (v.25), kept a secret for ages past.\n\u0026lsquo;Is manifested\u0026rsquo; refers back to the Gospel (the person and work of Jesus Christ) (v.25). We could paraphrase the verse (taking the liberty) \u0026lsquo;but now [the gospel] is manifested to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith\u0026rsquo;.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look to Scripture to help us interpret this. We know that Paul\u0026rsquo;s purpose of writing Romans is to communicate the Gospel. How are obedience, faith and the Gospel connected?\nWe see in the beginning of the church that many of the priests were becoming obedient:\n``` The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith. Acts 6:7``\nThose who are obedient, are given the Holy Spirit:\n``` And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.” Acts 5:32``\nWe also see that there are those who do not obey the Gospel:\n``` dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 2 Thessalonians 1:8``\nSo, we arrive at the question, how is is that one is obedient or disobedient in regards to the Gospel? The Gospel of John may shed some light:\n``` He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” John 3:36``\nClearly salvation is not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). So salvation is not on the basis of doing or performing. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t believe are considered disobedient however.\n``` obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. 1 Peter 1:9``\nPeter uses it again in the same chapter to show how believers are title or identification of \u0026lsquo;obedient children\u0026rsquo;:\nAs obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts *which were yours* in your ignorance, 1 Peter 1:14\nObedience of faith could also be stated, \u0026lsquo;obedience which is faith\u0026rsquo; when faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17).\nGod has gifted to every person the possibility to exercise faith. After hearing the message of the Gospel, they must trust, rest, believe it!\nThey said, “**Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved**, you and your household.\u0026quot; Acts 16:31\nPaul (as an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles) desired that the preaching of the Gospel might be responded to by faith thereby bringing about the declaration of them being obedient. Those who have been declared obedient, those who have trusted in what Christ did for them - dying for our sins and rising again, are to walk now by faith in their identity of obedient children.\nIf you have not made the decision to trust Christ personally - that he saved you from the penalty of your sin, you are considered disobedient before God and He will have to punish you. Trust Him by faith and find forgiveness of your sins today!\n"},{

      "content":"The term repentance comes with all sorts of different ideas. By doing a simple search on the internet we find it summed up in words like \u0026ldquo;remorse, contrition, contriteness, penitence, sorrow, regret\u0026rdquo;.\nMost would agree that this is what is meant when we use repentance/repent in our day to day use of the word. Probably the religious association is there for most. What I am tryng to look at in this note is how the Bible uses what we see translated as the word repentance in the English Bible. Why? Because word studies are good, they allow us to focus on how the word was used in Scripture, possibly how it was used during that time period it was written and also because words change their meaning over time. Perhaps the word was never intended as we understand it today.\nRegarding how words change their meaning over time, modern dictionaries continually update their word definitions based on contemporary usage of words as well as keeping the origin.\nMany Bible scholars admit that the word METANOIA translated originally to Latin and later from the Latin translated into English as repentance in a unfortunate. Luther says this\u0026hellip;\n“in no way does this do justice to the Greek.” (Luther’s Works , 48:67–68 John the Baptist# Mat 3:1 Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,\nMat 3:2 \u0026ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat did John mean when he called those in Judea to repent?\nMat 3:3 For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, \u0026ldquo;THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, \u0026lsquo;MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nA clue is seen in the phrase, \u0026ldquo;make ready the way of the Lord..\u0026rdquo;\nMat 3:4 Now John himself had a garment of camel\u0026rsquo;s hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.\nMat 3:5 Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan;\nMat 3:6 and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.\nMat 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, \u0026ldquo;You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\nInterestingly, Pharisees and Sadducees were taken by all this activity and wanted to join in. John speaks of \u0026lsquo;fleeing from the wrath to come\u0026rsquo;. What were they doing? They were following in doing whatever the people were doing.\nMat 3:8 \u0026ldquo;Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;\nThe fruit of in keeping with repentance, that is those who had repented (whatever that is to mean), was being baptized and confessing their sins.\nMat 3:9 and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, \u0026lsquo;We have Abraham for our father\u0026rsquo;; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.\nJohn brings to their attention what he is referring to. They thought (supposed) that by having Abraham as their forefather that they children of God. John shows the mistake in their thinking.\nMat 3:10 \u0026ldquo;The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Mat 3:11 \u0026ldquo;As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. Mat 3:12 \u0026ldquo;His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are two options when Jesus (Messiah) comes. He will baptize with the Holy Spirit (birthing children of God) and baptize by fire (judgment). John says I baptize you with water for repentance. Paul comments on this\u0026hellip;\nPaul said, \u0026ldquo;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\u0026rdquo; Acts 19:4\nJohn the Baptist, in preaching to the Judeans, calls them to repentance because the kingdom of heaven is near. The people were getting baptized because they had believed in Him who was coming after him. They were \u0026lsquo;preparing the way\u0026rsquo; and in an outward sign of that as \u0026lsquo;fruit\u0026rsquo; they were being baptized and confessing their sin.\nThe Pharisees and Sadducees had neither understood the message or believed in the He who would come after John, they were simply doing what felt like a good thing since all the people were doing it. They had supposed incorrectly. They needed to change their presupposition and consider John\u0026rsquo;s message.\n"},{

Rom 9:9 For this is the word of promise: \u0026ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:10 And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac; Rom 9:11 for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God\u0026rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, Rom 9:12 it was said to her, \u0026ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:13 Just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:14 What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! Rom 9:15 For He says to Moses, \u0026ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:16 So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. Rom 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, \u0026ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires. Rom 9:19 You will say to me then, \u0026ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:20 On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, \u0026ldquo;Why did you make me like this,\u0026rdquo; will it? Rom 9:21 Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? Rom 9:22 What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? Rom 9:23 And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, Rom 9:24 even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles. Rom 9:25 As He says also in Hosea, \u0026ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, \u0026lsquo;MY PEOPLE,\u0026rsquo; AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, \u0026lsquo;BELOVED.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:26 \u0026ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, \u0026lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,\u0026rsquo; THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, \u0026ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED; Rom 9:28 FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.\u0026rdquo; Rom 9:29 And just as Isaiah foretold, \u0026ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.\u0026rdquo; Israel\u0026rsquo;s Unbelief\nRom 9:30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; Rom 9:31 but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law. Rom 9:32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, Rom 9:33 just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:1 Brethren, my heart\u0026rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation. Rom 10:2 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. Rom 10:3 For not knowing about God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. Rom 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. The Message of Salvation to All\nRom 10:5 For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness. Rom 10:6 But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: \u0026ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, \u0026lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?\u0026rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down), Rom 10:7 or \u0026lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?\u0026rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:8 But what does it say? \u0026ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART\u0026rdquo;—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, Rom 10:9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; Rom 10:10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. Rom 10:11 For the Scripture says, \u0026ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; Rom 10:13 for \u0026ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:14 How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? Rom 10:15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:16 However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, \u0026ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. Rom 10:18 But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; \u0026ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:19 But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, \u0026ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:20 And Isaiah is very bold and says, \u0026ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.\u0026rdquo; Rom 10:21 But as for Israel He says, \u0026ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:1 I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. Rom 11:2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? Rom 11:3 \u0026ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:4 But what is the divine response to him? \u0026ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:5 In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God\u0026rsquo;s gracious choice. Rom 11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace. Rom 11:7 What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; Rom 11:8 just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:9 And David says, \u0026ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM. Rom 11:10 \u0026ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; Gentiles Grafted In\nRom 11:11 I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. Rom 11:12 Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be! Rom 11:13 But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, Rom 11:14 if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them. Rom 11:15 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Rom 11:16 If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too. Rom 11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, Rom 11:18 do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you. Rom 11:19 You will say then, \u0026ldquo;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:20 Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; Rom 11:21 for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either. Rom 11:22 Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God\u0026rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. Rom 11:23 And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. Rom 11:24 For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? The Mystery of Israel\u0026rsquo;s Salvation\nRom 11:25 For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; Rom 11:26 and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:27 \u0026ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\u0026rdquo; Rom 11:28 From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God\u0026rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; Rom 11:29 for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. Rom 11:30 For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, Rom 11:31 so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. Rom 11:32 For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all. Rom 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! Rom 11:34 For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR? Rom 11:35 Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN? Rom 11:36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.\n===\nIn God\u0026rsquo;s Sovereignty, God is always just# I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen. But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; nor are they all children because they are Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants, but: \u0026ldquo;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.\u0026rdquo; That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants. For this is the word of promise: \u0026ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.\u0026rdquo; And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac; for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God\u0026rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, it was said to her, \u0026ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.\u0026rdquo; Just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.\u0026rdquo; What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! For He says to Moses, \u0026ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.\u0026rdquo; So then it does not depend on the man who wills Esau willed or the man who runs, Jacob ran but on God who has mercy. God is merciful For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, \u0026ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.\u0026rdquo; So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires. You will say to me then, \u0026ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?\u0026rdquo; On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, \u0026ldquo;Why did you make me like this,\u0026rdquo; will it? Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles. As He says also in Hosea, \u0026ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, \u0026lsquo;MY PEOPLE,\u0026rsquo; AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, \u0026lsquo;BELOVED.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, \u0026lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,\u0026rsquo; THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.\u0026rdquo; Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, \u0026ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED; FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.\u0026rdquo; And just as Isaiah foretold, \u0026ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.\u0026rdquo; What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law. Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; Brethren, my heart\u0026rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation. For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. For not knowing about God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness. But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: \u0026ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, \u0026lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?\u0026rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down), or \u0026lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?\u0026rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).\u0026rdquo; But what does it say? \u0026ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART\u0026rdquo;— that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. For the Scripture says, \u0026ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; for \u0026ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.\u0026rdquo; How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!\u0026rdquo; However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, \u0026ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?\u0026rdquo; So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; \u0026ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.\u0026rdquo; But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, \u0026ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.\u0026rdquo; And Isaiah is very bold and says, \u0026ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.\u0026rdquo; But as for Israel He says, \u0026ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.\u0026rdquo; I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? \u0026ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.\u0026rdquo; But what is the divine response to him? \u0026ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.\u0026rdquo; In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God\u0026rsquo;s gracious choice. But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace. What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.\u0026rdquo; And David says, \u0026ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM. \u0026ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be! But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them.

If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you. You will say then, \u0026ldquo;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u0026rdquo; Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either. Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God\u0026rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery— so that you will not be wise in your own estimation— that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\u0026rdquo; From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God\u0026rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all. Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR? Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN? For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.\n=====\n9# 1 I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, 2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. 3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed, separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, 4 who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the temple service and the promises, 5 whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen. 6 But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; 7 nor are they all children because they are Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants, but: \u0026ldquo;THROUGH ISAAC YOUR DESCENDANTS WILL BE NAMED.\u0026rdquo; 8 That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants. 9 For this is the word of promise: \u0026ldquo;AT THIS TIME I WILL COME, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON.\u0026rdquo; 10 And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac; 11 for though the twins were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God\u0026rsquo;s purpose according to His choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, 12 it was said to her, \u0026ldquo;THE OLDER WILL SERVE THE YOUNGER.\u0026rdquo; 13 Just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;JACOB I LOVED, BUT ESAU I HATED.\u0026rdquo; 14 What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! 15 For He says to Moses, \u0026ldquo;I WILL HAVE MERCY ON WHOM I HAVE MERCY, AND I WILL HAVE COMPASSION ON WHOM I HAVE COMPASSION.\u0026rdquo; 16 So then it does not depend on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. 17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, \u0026ldquo;FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE I RAISED YOU UP, TO DEMONSTRATE MY POWER IN YOU, AND THAT MY NAME MIGHT BE PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH.\u0026rdquo; 18 So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires. 19 You will say to me then, \u0026ldquo;Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?\u0026rdquo; 20 On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, \u0026ldquo;Why did you make me like this,\u0026rdquo; will it? 21 Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? 22 What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? 23 And He did so to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, 24 even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles. 25 As He says also in Hosea, \u0026ldquo;I WILL CALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT MY PEOPLE, \u0026lsquo;MY PEOPLE,\u0026rsquo; AND HER WHO WAS NOT BELOVED, \u0026lsquo;BELOVED.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; 26 \u0026ldquo;AND IT SHALL BE THAT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS SAID TO THEM, \u0026lsquo;YOU ARE NOT MY PEOPLE,\u0026rsquo; THERE THEY SHALL BE CALLED SONS OF THE LIVING GOD.\u0026rdquo; 27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, \u0026ldquo;THOUGH THE NUMBER OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL BE LIKE THE SAND OF THE SEA, IT IS THE REMNANT THAT WILL BE SAVED; 28 FOR THE LORD WILL EXECUTE HIS WORD ON THE EARTH, THOROUGHLY AND QUICKLY.\u0026rdquo; 29 And just as Isaiah foretold, \u0026ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.\u0026rdquo; 30 What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; 31 but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law. 32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, 33 just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo;\n10# 1 Brethren, my heart\u0026rsquo;s desire and my prayer to God for them is for their salvation. 2 For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. 3 For not knowing about God\u0026rsquo;s righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 5 For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness. 6 But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: \u0026ldquo;DO NOT SAY IN YOUR HEART, \u0026lsquo;WHO WILL ASCEND INTO HEAVEN?\u0026rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ down), 7 or \u0026lsquo;WHO WILL DESCEND INTO THE ABYSS?\u0026rsquo; (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).\u0026rdquo; 8 But what does it say? \u0026ldquo;THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART\u0026rdquo;—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 9 that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 10 for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, \u0026ldquo;WHOEVER BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.\u0026rdquo; 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 13 for \u0026ldquo;WHOEVER WILL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD WILL BE SAVED.\u0026rdquo; 14 How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!\u0026rdquo; 16 However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, \u0026ldquo;LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT?\u0026rdquo; 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. 18 But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; \u0026ldquo;THEIR VOICE HAS GONE OUT INTO ALL THE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD.\u0026rdquo; 19 But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, \u0026ldquo;I WILL MAKE YOU JEALOUS BY THAT WHICH IS NOT A NATION, BY A NATION WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WILL I ANGER YOU.\u0026rdquo; 20 And Isaiah is very bold and says, \u0026ldquo;I WAS FOUND BY THOSE WHO DID NOT SEEK ME, I BECAME MANIFEST TO THOSE WHO DID NOT ASK FOR ME.\u0026rdquo; 21 But as for Israel He says, \u0026ldquo;ALL THE DAY LONG I HAVE STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO A DISOBEDIENT AND OBSTINATE PEOPLE.\u0026rdquo;\n11# 1 I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? 3 \u0026ldquo;Lord, THEY HAVE KILLED YOUR PROPHETS, THEY HAVE TORN DOWN YOUR ALTARS, AND I ALONE AM LEFT, AND THEY ARE SEEKING MY LIFE.\u0026rdquo; 4 But what is the divine response to him? \u0026ldquo;I HAVE KEPT for Myself SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WHO HAVE NOT BOWED THE KNEE TO BAAL.\u0026rdquo; 5 In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God\u0026rsquo;s gracious choice. 6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, otherwise grace is no longer grace. 7 What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened; 8 just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;GOD GAVE THEM A SPIRIT OF STUPOR, EYES TO SEE NOT AND EARS TO HEAR NOT, DOWN TO THIS VERY DAY.\u0026rdquo; 9 And David says, \u0026ldquo;LET THEIR TABLE BECOME A SNARE AND A TRAP, AND A STUMBLING BLOCK AND A RETRIBUTION TO THEM. 10 \u0026ldquo;LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED TO SEE NOT, AND BEND THEIR BACKS FOREVER.\u0026rdquo; 11 I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. 12 Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be! 13 But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, 14 if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them. 15 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? 16 If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are too. 17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree, 18 do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you. 19 You will say then, \u0026ldquo;Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.\u0026rdquo; 20 Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear; 21 for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either. 22 Behold then the kindness and severity of God; to those who fell, severity, but to you, God\u0026rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. 23 And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. 24 For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree? 25 For I do not want you, brethren, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in; 26 and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.\u0026rdquo; 27 \u0026ldquo;THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\u0026rdquo; 28 From the standpoint of the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but from the standpoint of God\u0026rsquo;s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers; 29 for the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 30 For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience, 31 so these also now have been disobedient, that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy. 32 For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all. 33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways! 34 For WHO HAS KNOWN THE MIND OF THE LORD, OR WHO BECAME HIS COUNSELOR? 35 Or WHO HAS FIRST GIVEN TO HIM THAT IT MIGHT BE PAID BACK TO HIM AGAIN? 36 For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.\n"},{

Santiago 1:1 ### Para el entendimiento correcto del libro de Santiago, es importante determinar a quienes escribe. ¿Son judios creyentes o incrédulos? #### Santiago menciona la palabra hermanos 15 veces en su carta. Santiago 1:16, 1:19, 2:1, 2:5, 2:14, 3:1, 3:10, 3:12, 4:11, 5:7, 5:9, 5:10, 5:12, 5:19 ##### Santiago 1:2 *Tengan por sumo gozo, **hermanos míos, cuando se hallen en diversas pruebas**,* ##### Santiago 2:1 - ***Hermanos míos, no tengan su fe en nuestro glorioso Señor Jesucristo** con una actitud de favoritismo.* ##### Santiago 5:7 *Por tanto, **hermanos, sean pacientes hasta la venida del Señor**. Miren cómo el labrador espera el fruto precioso de la tierra, siendo paciente en ello hasta que recibe la lluvia temprana y la tardía.* #### Concluimos pues que Santiago escribe su carta a judios creyentes. ##\tFe sin obras no tiene provecho en la vida de uno mismo ###\tSantiago 2:14-20 Un creyente que no pone en obras su fe queda infructuoso en su santificación. #### Santiago 2:14 - *¿De qué sirve, hermanos míos, si alguien dice que tiene fe, pero no tiene obras? ¿Acaso puede esa fe salvarlo?* ##### Santiago habla de lo inservible para uno mismo que un hermano tenga fe pero no que no tiene obras. ##### Las fe en acción, puesta en buenas obras es para santificación (salvación del poder del pecado) para el creyente. Santiago 1:21-25 ##\t4 Ejemplos claros para illustrar como la fe sin obras es inservible. ###\tSantiago 2:15-20 El mal ejemplo del que dice pero no ayuda a un hermano #### Santiago 2:15 - *Si un hermano o una hermana no tienen ropa y carecen del sustento diario,* #### Santiago 2:16 - *y uno de ustedes les dice: «Vayan en paz, caliéntense y sáciense», pero no les dan lo necesario para su cuerpo, ¿de qué sirve?* #### Santiago 2:17 - *Así también la fe por sí misma, si no tiene obras, está muerta.* #### Santiago 2:18 - *Pero alguien dirá: «Tú tienes fe y yo tengo obras. Muéstrame tu fe sin las obras, y yo te mostraré mi fe por mis obras».* #### Santiago 2:19 - *Tú crees que Dios es uno. Haces bien; también los demonios creen, y tiemblan.* #### Santiago 2:20 - *Pero, ¿estás dispuesto a admitir, oh hombre vano, que la fe sin obras es estéril?* ### Santiago 2:21-24 El buen ejemplo de la justificación de Abraham ante los hombres #### Santiago 2:21 - *¿No fue justificado por las obras Abraham nuestro padre cuando ofreció a su hijo Isaac sobre el altar?* #### Santiago 2:22 - *Ya ves que la fe actuaba juntamente con sus obras, y como resultado de las obras, la fe fue perfeccionada;* #### Santiago 2:23 - *y se cumplió la Escritura que dice: «Y ABRAHAM CREYÓ A DIOS Y LE FUE CONTADO POR JUSTICIA», y fue llamado amigo de Dios.* #### Santiago 2:24 - *Ustedes ven que el hombre es justificado por las obras y no solo por la fe.* ### Santiago 2:25 - El buen ejemplo de la justificación de Rahab ante los espias #### Santiago 2:25 - *Y de la misma manera, ¿no fue la ramera Rahab también justificada por las obras cuando recibió a los mensajeros y los envió por otro camino?* ### Santiago 2:26 - El ejemplo del cuerpo sin el espíritu #### Santiago 2:26 - *Porque así como el cuerpo sin el espíritu está muerto, así también la fe sin las obras está muerta.* "},{

      "content":" But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth. 1 Timothy 4:1-3\nI am currently teaching through the book of 1 Timothy. Paul\u0026rsquo;s instructions to his disciple Timothy are of increadible value due to what is taught regarding the nature of the church.\nThe church of Jesus Christ is the upholder and defender of truth. However he explains to Timothy how he should conduct himself in the household of God. The church is presented as a houshold. God\u0026rsquo;s family that should be run as a functional (vs disfunctional) family. The leaders are to be well acquainted with family life as a condition for becoming leaders.\nThen in chapter 4 Paul reminds of Timothy of how the Holy Spirit had said that in later times people would come along who were used of demons to teach things contrary to the truth. It seems rather strange that their \u0026lsquo;great heresy\u0026rsquo; was to teach against marriage and eating. This does not seem so bad in light of all we see going on around us. Especially regarding deceptive teaching that leads people astray\u0026hellip;or wait\u0026hellip;maybe he IS talking about deceptive things using family examples.\nThe Attack# Marriage is the foundation of a family. When a man and a woman get married a new family is born. Often times children are born and are incorporated into that family.\nEating is key because we usually eat three times a day. That makes about 1095 times we are together as a family enjoying a meal together and enjoying eachother\u0026rsquo;s company. The family aspect of the household of God was under attack. These deceivers were introducing false aspects that strayed them away from the family aspect.\n"},{

      "title": "Two Instructors",
      "content":"Two Instructors# -by John Wry\nThe New Testament mentions two instructors, two trainers. One is referred to as instructor law and the other is referred to as instructor grace.\nWhile it is true that law can mean the time period in which Israel lived and now we are under grace, that is not what I am referring to here. Law can mean many things namely; civil law, a principle, a specific law, 10 commandments, or legalism. Legalism is the definition I will speak of here.\nWhy do I mean by legalism? It is the attitude of the heart seeking to earn God\u0026rsquo;s blessing, justification and sanctification through any other means that is not by faith alone in Christ alone.\nA bit of my background# I have been thinking a bit lately about how I assumed the law for many years to be \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; truth. That is, those believers still speaking about grace, was to my understanding, a clear evidence of their lack of \u0026lsquo;spiritual depth\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;d say to myself \u0026lsquo;ah he\u0026rsquo;s a newbie\u0026rsquo;. To say it a different way, unless a believer had learned to live under the burden of weight taught by the law, he or she was (to me) essentially immature and was yet needing to be \u0026lsquo;illuminated\u0026rsquo; by the \u0026lsquo;meat of the Word\u0026rsquo;. Someone who talks about God\u0026rsquo;s love and God\u0026rsquo;s grace all the time was clearly (and according to my theology) either lacking in willpower and resolve and, to put it in a picture, still on christian training wheels. In my theology, \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; Christian \u0026lsquo;depth\u0026rsquo; came through my \u0026lsquo;abandon\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;obedience\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;sacrifice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;submission\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;resolve\u0026rsquo;. Those things have a way of sounding good but the more I focused on them, the harder it got, the more frustrated I felt and ultimately had to be honest and admit defeat. To admit defeat or to come to terms with the reality that I could not do it, was actually perhaps my first step forward. I needed to be taught a new way.\nIt was not until I was introduced to healthy doctrine of Scripture, that I began to understand there was a very different way. The Scripture was teaching it all along I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t listening because I was too busy reading my \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; meaning into it. I was too busy being \u0026rsquo;the guide to the blind\u0026rsquo; to be teachable, too busy doing my best for Jesus to see God\u0026rsquo;s provision of Jesus.\nTwo Teachings# In the book of Galatians, Paul brings out that the law is a schoolmaster or instructor. In Titus, God\u0026rsquo;s grace is also stated as an instructor. However the two (though both are perfect) are very different in purpose.\nThese are two teachers that bring with them two different teachings. The law teaches or instructs about needing righteousness and points to Christ but produces a sense of condemnation, an understanding of one\u0026rsquo;s reality before God but not a solution.\nGrace also has an instruction. It teaches, explains, illustrates to us how God wishes to produce in us his heart through His solution, Jesus Christ who gave himself to be condemned so we could have life. Titus says it is God\u0026rsquo;s grace that trains us in authentic righteous living. It shows forth Christ and His work. It is by far a loftier, higher, more sublime way (Gal 5:4).\nThey are two different teachings to two different audiences.\nTwo Audiences# In 1 Timothy, Paul explains that the teaching of the law or the appropriate use of the law is for the unrighteous. In Galatians he explains how the law\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to lead to Christ and how when one believes in the work of deliverance of Christ, he is not under that instructor. In fact, Romans 7 tells us that to place oneself under the law is to place oneself under our former master and in the illustration of marriage Paul gives, metaphorically to commit spiritual adultery.\nAccording to Titus, the appropriate audience for the instruction of grace is for those who have seen (or understood) His grace and trusted in Christ. It is to them that grace becomes an instructor, teaching how to let go of sinful ways and how to live in real, authentic, integral piety. The law cannot do this, it is weakened, not because of it\u0026rsquo;s source (God) or that it has a flaw but it fails to produce Christian piety because of the flesh. The flesh is activated by the law. Therefore, when we died with Christ, we were made to die to the law (Romans 7:4) so that we might bear fruit unto God.\nA better way# Obviously God\u0026rsquo;s way is the right way and any other way falls short. Colossians states, to submit to decrees, to man-made ways of becoming spiritual is failure because it has no power over the flesh\u0026rsquo;s powerful enslavement. Paul says in Galatians, the only way is to stand firm. The interesting thing is that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026lsquo;stand firm in your resolve\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;stand firm in the law\u0026rsquo;. No, he says \u0026lsquo;stand firm in the grace of God\u0026rsquo; or hold on tightly to God\u0026rsquo;s grace lest you become slaves again. This slavery in the context of Galatians would come through once again putting oneself under the instruction of the law.\nIn Conclusion# The more I search, the more I see how God is softly and continuously saying to stand firm in His grace. This is taught throughout Scripture.\nPerhaps we should not seek to be \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;higher\u0026rsquo;. Perhaps the ways of man only interrupt what God really wants to do in the life of the believer? Perhaps putting on the yoke of the law is really slavery after all and only produces self-condemnation, frustration and ultimate defeat even though it has the outward appearance of spiritual. Paul said it was the law that resulted (due to the flesh) in his death or separation from God.\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say I\u0026rsquo;ll trust God\u0026rsquo;s grace to be my teacher. I\u0026rsquo;ll trust it because that\u0026rsquo;s what I see Scripture says is God\u0026rsquo;s provision to conform me to the image of Christ. I will sit under her instruction. I will look to her for understanding I will hang on tight to her every word. I am grateful to the law for clearly showing me my need but now grace is teaching me how Christ supplies all in all.\nAs I look back in my own life as a believer, I can clearly see the instruction received by grace has made all the difference for good in my life.\nWho\u0026rsquo;s teaching do you sit under, Law\u0026rsquo;s or Grace\u0026rsquo;s?\n"},{

      "title": "You are Teaching &#39;Easy Believism&#39;",
      "content":"You are Teaching \u0026lsquo;Easy Believism\u0026rsquo;# Just recently, I received a kind accusation of teaching \u0026rsquo;easy believism\u0026rsquo;. I was asked three questions.\nAre believers different to disciples? So, this is my more formal response - a work in progress but perhaps it might shed some light for others that are tragically caught in the midst of this divide.\nFirst off, I ask myself, what do people mean by the term \u0026lsquo;easy believism\u0026rsquo;? A quick search on the internet returns the following as a first option\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Easy believism is a somewhat derogatory term used by opponents of the view that one needs only to believe in Jesus in order to be saved. From this they conclude that those who hold to sola fide teach that no corresponding need exists for a committed life of Christian discipleship as proof of salvation; however, that is not what sola fide means. True faith in Christ will always lead to a changed life. Another common usage of the term easy believism is in regards to those who believe they’re saved because they prayed a prayer—with no real conviction of sin and no real faith in Christ. Praying a prayer is easy—thus the term easy believism—but there is more to salvation than mouthing words.\u0026rdquo; 1\nAccording to this short definition, there seems to be at least two different options; \u0026ldquo;that one needs only to believe in Jesus in order to be saved\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;those who believe they\u0026rsquo;re saved because they prayed a prayer - with no real conviction of sin and no real faith in Christ\u0026rdquo;.\nBiblically, I it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to find that praying a prayer, with or without real conviction of sin, saves anyone anyway, so that is not an option I wish to persue within the scope of this article.\nPaul said,\nand may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, Philippians 3:9\nThat leaves us with only one possibly definition to discuss, \u0026ldquo;that one needs only to believe in Jesus in order to be saved\u0026rdquo;.\nDaniel Fuller of Fuller Theological Seminary states,\nGenuine faith must go beyond the mere intellectual assent concerning biblical doctrines. People must let the implications of these doctrines radically affect their hearts so that they respond positively to God with the obedience and works of faith. 2\nSo, according to Fuller, when Scripture says \u0026ldquo;believe,\u0026rdquo; he understands it to mean \u0026ldquo;obedience and works of faith\u0026rdquo;.\nJohn MacArthur, one who has popularized the notion that one must make Christ Lord as a condition for salvation states,\nThe gospel according to Jesus explicitly and unequivocally rules out easy-believism. To make all of our Lord’s difficult demands apply only to a higher class of Christians blunts the force of His entire message. It makes room for a cheap and meaningless faith – a faith that may be exercised with absolutely no impact on the fleshly life of sin. That is not saving faith.3\nBy this, I believe MacArthur is saying \u0026ldquo;saving faith\u0026rdquo; has to cost you at least a change from a \u0026ldquo;fleshly life of sin\u0026rdquo;, otherwise it simply is not going to save you. I would just quickly interject a counterthought that faith does not save, Christ does, but evidently MacAuthur believes that Christ will not save unless you\u0026rsquo;ve earned the right to receive the forgiveness of sins. I thought grace had to be free in order to still be by definition grace. But before I come across as \u0026lsquo;cheeky\u0026rsquo;, let\u0026rsquo;s move on\u0026hellip;\nMark Talbot adds his opinion to the topic:\nAmerican Christianity tends toward a kind of “easy-believism.” The Gospel is often presented in a way that suggests that someone is saved as soon as he or she has “accepted” Jesus as Savior, even if that “acceptance” never manifests itself in the emotional and volitional recentering of the person’s entire life. But this is actually the paradigm of the sort of dead and fruitless faith that the whole New Testament condemns.4\nOne sums it up in a catch phrase\u0026hellip;\nAlthough a Christian should believe simply, he should not “simply believe.”5\nWho do We Turn to? Who can Help us Decide?# All of these definitions sound convincing, logical and familiar. One might be convinced at this point, but before you close this article, let\u0026rsquo;s check, just in case, do they stand the litmus test of Scripture?\nWe owe to ourselves to know the truth, not just hearing people\u0026rsquo;s opinions. If we are not willing to search the Scriptures carefully, we will spent our time arguing over who\u0026rsquo;s argument, tradition and norms are better and utimately he who argues best, wins (the argument is won but the truth has eluded us).\nA Real issue or Merely Semantics?# Ryrie cautions:\nthat the message of faith only and the message of faith plus commitment of life cannot both be the gospel; therefore, one of them is a false gospel and comes under the curse of perverting the gospel or preaching another gospel (Gal. 1:6–9). As far as sanctification is concerned, if only committed people are saved people, then where is there room for carnal Christians? (p. 170).6\nCarnal Christians# Does the Bible state the possibility of a believer being carnal?\n1Co 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.\n1Co 3:2 I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,\n1Co 3:3 for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?\nNotice the term Paul used, infants in Christ. I submit to you that that is not only of believers who have backslidden (as was the case of [some of] the Corinthian believers) or never grown but in fact infant does imply newborn. In other words, The Lordship of Jesus Christ is not yet realized in the infant in Christ, however he undoubtedly is in Christ. This cannot be ignored in the midst of a heated argument of which argument \u0026lsquo;sounds more logical\u0026rsquo;.\nLest I fail to mention at a later point\u0026hellip;\nEph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;\nEph 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\nSalvation is not of ourselves. It is not the amount of our faith, the duration of our faith, the quality of our faith that saves and certainly not our works. It is God who saves. In fact salvation is a un unmerited gift. A gift by definition is free of charge or merit.\nFaith is not a work\nRom 4:5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,\nSo again, it\u0026rsquo;s not the quantity, quality or duration of faith that saves but who faith is placed on. \u0026ldquo;But to the one who\u0026hellip; believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness\u0026rdquo;. Not kind of faith but faith in Jesus as the one who justifies the ungodly.\nAbsolute Righteousness not Resolute Willpower# Isa 64:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.\nIf our righteounesses (our \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; works) are like a filthy garments and we are unclean, how can we, who are the problem, turn our life around, make a resolution to never \u0026lsquo;practice\u0026rsquo; sin, abandon a sinful lifestyle to lead a \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; life that is pleasing to God? This is totally undermining God\u0026rsquo;s absolute righteousness, God\u0026rsquo;s holiness and God\u0026rsquo;s hatred of sin. How can God bring his righeousness down to man\u0026rsquo;s level so he can do something \u0026lsquo;smallish\u0026rsquo; and yet \u0026lsquo;doable\u0026rsquo;? How can sinful man do anything sort of \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; like make a resolute decision for willpower over sin and be considered perfect by God? This is absolutely ludicrous and blasfemous to why Jesus would have to die in the first place.\nGal 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, \u0026ldquo;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.\u0026rdquo;\nGod never stooped in his righteousness. God never lowered his standard. Instead what He did was send His Son who fulfilled the righteousness of God on our behalf.\n2Co 5:21 He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\nGod did that already. It\u0026rsquo;s done. The only thing that\u0026rsquo;s needed is for it to be credited to my account. This is promised to those who believe in Him.\nRom 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? \u0026ldquo;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.\u0026rdquo;\nWho are Truly His Disciples?# Is God\u0026rsquo;s Ultimate Intention to find Subjugates\nIt may surprise you that I ask this, but Scriptures states that all will ultimately bow a knew to Christ and recognize he is Lord of lords and King of kings.

Introducción# El libro de Zacarías es posiblemente la presentación más clara en el Antiguo Testamento de Cristo, anunciado en su rol como el Mesias de Israel. El libro de Zacarías es contado entre los profetas menores aunque tiene más capitulos que el libro de Daniel. Sin embargo, entre los profetas menos es el más Mesianico. Conocemos al Mesias en su primera venida y también en su segundo advenimiento. El libro de Zararías presenta al Mesias como su abogado defensor, como el que lucha a su favor, como el salvador y redentor y finalmente como su rey. La audiencia directa del libro es a Israel y no la Iglesia, sin embargo nos es de mucho provecho conocer como Dios se revela en su caracter y planes inmediatos como a futuro. Dios revela sus planes a Israel en un tiempo del pasado cuando Juda estaba regresando a la tierra prometida despues de estar cautivos en Babilonia por 70 años. Dios hace claro que su deseo es que vean su regreso a la tierra y la reconstrucción del templo como secundarios a su regreso a El. Juda necesita un regreso espiritual a Dios y no debe equivocarse entre las bendiciones de la tierra y el tempo con el bendito Dios todopoderoso. Esperamos que este estudio sea de mucha bendición para su vida al conocer más intimamente a Cristo como el Mesias de Israel.\n\u0026ldquo;Antes bien, crezcan en la gracia y el conocimiento de nuestro Señor y Salvador Jesucristo. A Él sea la gloria ahora y hasta el día de la eternidad. Amén.\u0026rdquo; 2 Pedro 3:18 (NBLA)\nDATOS SOBRE EL LIBRO DE ZACARíAS Título Zekar-yah Autor Zacarías, hijo de Berequias, sacerdote, miembro de la sinagoga, nacido durante el exilio, jóven.

Zacarías 1:1a \u0026ldquo;En el octavo mes del segundo año de Darío\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; 520 AC. las fechas se dan según el rey gentil gobernante. Este rey, Darío I, es un sucesor de Ciro el Persia. Gobernó desde 522 a.C. hasta 486 a.C. Esdras 4-6# 1. No hay rey de Israel o Judá en este momento. Zorobabel es puesto como gobernador. Su nombre es persa y significa \u0026ldquo;descendiente de Babilonia\u0026rdquo;.# 2. Algunas fechas para ayudar a entender dónde estamos en la historia de Israel.# Año Evento 722 a.C. Los asirios conquistan Israel al norte 700 a.C. Isaías profetizó que un rey llamado Ciro sería fundamental para devolver al pueblo y reconstruir Jerusalén. Isaías 44:28, Isaías 45:13 605 a.C. Comienza el EXILIO. Los babilonios conquistan Judá. 586 a.C. El templo es destruido 538 a.C. Ciro hace un deree para liberar a los exiliados y regresar para reconstruir el templo. Esdras 1:1-4, 6:3 536 a.C. Comienza la fundación del templo Después de que se sentaron las bases para el templo, los samaritanos comenzaron a hacer problemas para desalentar cualquier reconstrucción. Esdras 4:1-6:28, La mujer samaritana y Jesús tienen una conversación en torno a este tema muchos siglos después. (Juan 4:19-24) 520 a.C. Darío I reafirmó el decreto de Ciro, pero el templo permaneció en ruinas. (Esdras 6:1-12, Hag 1:4) Comienza la reconstrucción del templo. Hageo y Zecharias comienzan su ministerio. 516 a.C. el Templo está terminado 457 a.C. Artajerjes I emitió un decreto a Esdras, dando autonomía a Judá., Esd 7:12-26 444 a.C. Artajerjes I emitió un decreto a Nehemías para reconstruir Jersualem. Neh 2:1-8 a)\tLos tiempos de los gentiles está en progreso. Dan 9:24-27, Lucas 21:24, Rom 11:25# a. El linaje de David no está sobre el trono y los tiempos de los gentiles están en progreso. (Dan 9:24, Luc 21:24, Rom 11:25).# 3. El segundo año de Darío es el mismo año en el que profetizó Hageo.# 4. Debido a los reveses causados por los samarios, han pasado unos 17 años desde el decreto de Ciro de regresar a la tierra y restaurar el templo. El temple permanece en ruinas. Esd 4-6# B. Zacarías 1:1b \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;vino la palabra del SEÑOR al profeta Zacarías\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;# 1. Lo que habló Zacarías no era de su propia iniciativa o deducción. Era palabra de Dios. Hebreos 1:1,2 2 Timoteo 3:16-17# 2. Hageo recibió una profecía en septiembre (para comenzar a reconstruir el templo), octubre (Hag 2) y diciembre, pero Zacarías recibió una profecía en noviembre.# a. Dos meses antes de la profecía de Zacarías, habían comenzado a reconstruir el templo.# b. Un mes antes, estaban desanimados. Hageo les dió un mensaje alentador de esperanza. Hageo# c.\tEl gobernador Zorobabel escuchó y siguió lo que Dios ordenó. Esdras 5:22# C. Zacarías 1:1c \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;hijo de Berequías, hijo de Iddo, diciendo\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; Zac 1:1, Zac 1:7# 1. No sabemos mucho de Berequías, el padre de Zacarías.# a. Jesus menciona a un profeta martirizado llamado Zacarías hijo de Berequías en Mat 23:35. Lucas menciona a Zacarías pero no al padre. Luc 11:51, 2 Cró 24:20-22. Es dificil saber con certeza.# i. Opción 1: Berequias significa lo mismo que Jehoiada y posiblemente Jesus o Mateo lo usan de esa manera.# ii. Opción 2: Berequías era el padre mientras que Jehoiada era su abuelo.# iii. Opción 3: Jesus queria demostrar que era testigo ocular del asesinato de Zacarías al igual que lo fue con Abel.# iv. Opción 4: Error en los manuscritos al copiar de un texto a otro.# 2. Iddo, su abuelo, era sacerdote, listado entre ellos que habian retornado de Babilionia. Neh 12:1-4# a. En 520 a.C., Zacarías probablemente era un jóven. Zac 2:4# b. Zacarías era un profeta, este era su cargo.# D. Zacarías 1:2 \u0026quot;«El SEÑOR se enojó mucho contra sus padres.\u0026quot; Los 70 años de exilio es prueba de aquello. 2 Crónicas 36# E. Zacarías 1:3a \u0026ldquo;Diles, pues\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Zacarías debía hablar la palabra de Dios a la gente, esto incluiría a los de la generación mayor que regresaron, y jóvenes como Zorobabel y Josué que venian por primera vez.# F. Zacarias 1:3b \u0026ldquo;Diles, pues\u0026hellip;“Así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; El SEÑOR de los ejércitos\u0026quot; aparece 52 veces en Zacarías.# a.\t\u0026ldquo;El Señor de los ejércitos\u0026rdquo; aparece no menos de 52 veces en Zacarías. La forma en que se usa este título de Dios implica los recursos ilimitados disponibles a su disposición para su pueblo. Significa hostia que sale, ejército, guerra. Una hostia es una masa de personas organizadas generalmente para la batalla. El uso de este título implica que Dios es Aquel que va delante y lucha a favor.# 1.\tAun en su juventúd, David entendió que fue Dios quien luchaba por ellos contra sus enemigos cuando fue ante Goliat \u0026ldquo;en el nombre del Señor de los ejércitos\u0026rdquo;. 1 Sam 17:45-46# 2.\tZacarías proclama el mensaje que viene del mismo Señor de los ejércitos. Esto es crucial para ver la importancia de su mensaje. Afortunadamente, Zorobabel y Josué no cuestionan la autoridad del mensaje de Zacarías.# 3.\tRomanos 9:29 – \u0026ldquo;Y como antes dijo Isaías: Si el Señor de los ejércitos no nos hubiera dejado descendencia, Como Sodoma habríamos venido a ser, y a Gomorra seríamos semejantes.\u0026rdquo; Isaias 1:9# 4.\tSantiago 5:4 - \u0026ldquo;He aquí, clama el jornal de los obreros\u0026hellip;y los clamores de los que habían segado han entrado en los oídos del Señor de los ejércitos.\u0026rdquo; Santiago le recuerda al creyente de la edad de la iglesia con raíces hebreas acerca de cómo el Señor de los ejércitos les había dicho que actuaran de manera justa con todos y confiaran en El para Su provisión. Malaquias 3:5, Zacarías 7:8-10# G. Zacarías 1:3c \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;‘Vuélvanse a Mí’, declara el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, ‘y Yo me volveré a ustedes’, dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos.‘ \u0026ldquo; Jeremías 31:16-26, 30-34# 1.\tLo opuesto de retornar es apartarse. Habían abandonado al Señor a quien necesitaban regresar. Jeremías 31:19# 2.\tEl resultado sería el regreso de Dios a ellos como el Señor de los ejércitos de Su nación. Jeremías 31:23-26# H. Zacarías 1:4a No sean como sus padres, a quienes los antiguos profetas proclamaron, diciendo: “Así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos: ‘Vuélvanse ahora de sus malos caminos y de sus malas obras’”\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;* Apo 2:1-7# 1.\tLos malos caminos y las malas acciones son demostrables, pero un retorno a Dios no se trata simplemente de dejar de hacer cosas malas, sino de un regreso a la comunión.# a.\tUn retorno a Dios es la condición del corazón (interno). Las formas cambiadas son el resultado (externas).# H. Zacarías 1:4b \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;Pero no me escucharon ni me hicieron caso’, declara el SEÑOR\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; Dios extiende una invitación a un regreso espiritual en un momento de un regreso físico.# 1.\tDios invita a Judá a entrar en una relación íntima, no meramente externa, de hacer memoria religiosa. Zacarías 7:4-6, 8:2, Amós 5:21-27, Colosenses 2:23# a.\tSegún el diccionario, el rito es una rutina mecánica o irreflexiva o de repetición.# i)\tDios odia los ritos religiosos como un reemplazo para una relación consigo mismo. Isaías 1:12-18, Santiago 1:26# ii)\tLa religiocidad vacía es considerada violencia contra la ley. Ezequiel 22:26, Sofonías 3:4# a. En Hechos 17:21 Pablo compara la religion como la supersticion. \u0026ldquo;Entonces Pablo poniéndose en pie en medio del Areópago, dijo: «Varones atenienses, percibo que ustedes son muy religiosos en todo sentido.\u0026rdquo;# i) \u0026ldquo;Religiosos\u0026rdquo; significa reverenciar a los dioses y otras cosas divinas.# I. Zacarías 1:5a \u0026quot;‘Sus padres, ¿dónde están?\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; La gran mayoria de esa generación se quedaron o ya habían muerto en tierra extranjera. Salmos 90:10# J. Zacarías 1:5b \u0026quot;‘\u0026hellip;Y los profetas, ¿viven para siempre?\u0026quot; El mensaje de los profetas debía ser escuchado en el momento que fue proclamado. La obediencia postergada es desobediencia.# 1. Dios les habló en aquel entonces. Debieron escuchar y volver a Dios. Dios ofrece salvación hoy, no necesariamente mañana. 2 Coríntios 6:2# K. Zacarías 1:6a \u0026quot;¿Acaso no alcanzaron a sus padres Mis palabras y Mis estatutos que Yo ordené a Mis siervos los profetas?\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; Dios lo había hecho abundantemente claro a todos. No tenian excusa.# L. Zacarías 1:6b \u0026ldquo;Por eso se arrepintieron y dijeron: “Como el SEÑOR de los ejércitos se propuso hacer con nosotros conforme a nuestros caminos y conforme a nuestras obras, así ha hecho con nosotros”’”».\u0026rdquo;# 1. Otra opción para traducir la palabra \u0026ldquo;arrepintieron\u0026rdquo; (SHUB) es como \u0026ldquo;volvieron\u0026rdquo; (RV60). Físicamente algunos de esa generación habían vuelto pero no se habían arrepentido (no cambiaron de mente). Compare Zacarías 1:3 con Zacarías 1:6# a.\tSi hemos de pensar que se arrepintieron, entonces se está haciendo referencia a ellos de manera positiva. Sin embargo, todo el argumento de la amonestación depende del hecho de que la generación anterior no hizo lo correcto.# i) Reconocieron su falta pero no cambiaron de forma de pensar, simplemente aceptaron el castigo de Dios como merecido. Eze 20:43# b.\tEl propósito entonces debe ser mostrar que la generación anterior había regresado, aceptando su destino como de Dios por hacer el mal, pero todavía no confiaban en Dios.# c. Esta generación presente no debe tomar ese enfoque y meramente retornar a la tierra, sino más bien retornar a El!# a. Una nota sobre el arrepentimiento bíblico# i. No es simplemente reconocer el mal que uno ha hecho. Mat 27:3-5# ii. No es sentir pena o lastima por hacer algo. (Ese es el significado actual en el diccionario)# iii. No es dejar de pecar, prometer no pecar o cambiar la vida de uno del pecado. Puede ser útil darse cuenta que la frase \u0026ldquo;arrepiéntete de tus pecados\u0026rdquo; no se encuentra en la Biblia. Hechos 2:38 dice \u0026ldquo;arrepentíos para el perdón de los pecados\u0026rdquo;.# iv. No es algo que midas para ver si es un arrepentimiento real, verdadero o auténtico. Este es un concepto erróneo común que plaga el cristianismo hoy en día. La raíz es el arrepentimiento, que es interno. Los resultados podrían ser externos y podrían verse de manera diferente en cada caso, pero no que sean requisados por Dios para que lo interno sea auténtico. Lucas 3:8-18# b.\tEl arrepentimiento bíblico es cambiar la mente hacia Dios, cambias tu pensamiento con respecto a lo que estás confiando para confiar en Dios. Hechos 20:21, Hechos 11:18, Isaías 1:18, Heb 6:1# i)\tPor ejemplo, en el caso de un incrédulo, cambiar de opinión sobre la oferta de Dios hecha a través del Evangelio (que Cristo murió pagando por nuestros pecados y resucitando) y creerlo. Lucas 24:45-47, Hechos 19:4, Lucas 13:1-5# ii)\tO para un creyente en el error debe arrepentirse (cambiar su pensamiento) hacia Dios con respecto a caminar de acuerdo con la carne o el estilo de vida pecaminoso, por ejemplo. Apocalipsis 2:21, Apocalipsis 3:3, Apocalipsis 3:19, 1 Jn 1:9, Rom 6:1-11, Rom 8:12-13, Gal 5:16# Conclusion del Primer Mensaje# Dios invitó a esta generación a regresar a sí mismo. Era una invitación a una relación de confianza y dependencia en Dios. La generación anterior había desobedecido a Dios. Regresaron físicamente a la tierra, incluso reconocieron su error, pero nunca cambiaron de opinión y colocaron su fe solo en Dios. Regresar a Dios es un acto de fe (cambiar la mente hacia Dios) no por obras externas (es decir, regresar a la tierra, reconstruir el templo).\nIII. Zacarías 1:7- 6:15 - Segundo Mensaje - 8 Visiones# Las ocho visiones debían servir como animo para la nación. Zacarías recibió estas 8 visiones en una noche. Las 8 visiones siguen esencialmente el mismo patrón.\nIntroducción Una explicación de lo que se vio Solicitud de aclaración El significado de la visión Visión Significado 1. Jinete entre los mirtos (1:7-17): Jerusalén y el templo serán reconstruidos. Las naciones observaron 2. 4 cuernos y 4 artesanos (1:18-21): Los cuatro imperios serán aterrorizados por cuatro artesanos 3. Medición de Jerusalén (2:1-13): Jerusalén restaurada 4. El Sumo Sacerdote (3:1-10): Judá rechaza a Dios, pero finalmente Dios los restaurará 5. 2 Olivos (4:1-14): Dios da poder a su pueblo por medio de Su Espíritu 6. El pergamino volador (5:1-4): _____________ 7. El Ephah (5:5-11): ____________ 8. Cuatro carros (6:1-15): Gentiles juzgados / El reinado de Cristo A. Zacarías 1:7-17 La visión de un jinete en los árboles de mirto# 1. Zacarías 1:7 En el vigésimo cuarto día del undécimo mes, que es el mes de Shebat, en el segundo año de Darío, \u0026hellip; tres meses después de recibir el primer mensaje, Zacarías recibe otro mensaje del Señor en forma de 8 visiones en una noche. Zac 1:1# 2. Zacarías 1:7b la palabra del SEÑOR vino a Zacarías el profeta, el hijo de Berechiah, el hijo de Iddo, de la siguiente manera: Dios habló de nuevo a Zechariah y sucedió así\u0026hellip;# a. Una vez más Zacarías da su ascendencia. Zacarías era de una línea sacerdotal que servía como profeta.# 3. Zacarías 1:8a Vi por la noche\u0026hellip; Esto no es un sueño, es una visión, que recibió mientras estaba despierto por la noche. Las visiones se recibieron mientras estaba despierto y los sueños son revelaciones mientras dormía. Así fue como Dios se comunicó con los profetas. Números 12:6# 4. Zacarías 1:8b y he aquí, un hombre estaba montado en un caballo rojo\u0026hellip; Lo primero que Zacarías fue un hombre en un caballo rojo. En el versículo 11 se nos dice que este hombre es el ángel del Señor.# a. Los caballos en ese entonces eran la forma más rápida de viajar. Los caballos también se ven a menudo en contextos relacionados con la guerra.# b. El color rojo a menudo se asocia con sangre y/o guerra.# c. Vemos que el ángel del Señor está listo para hacer la guerra, mientras que en Apocalipsis 19:11 vemos a Cristo montando un caballo blanco que significa su propósito de conquistar.# 5. Zacarías 1:8b y él estaba de pie entre los árboles de mirto que estaban en el barranco, Curiosamente, los tres de mirto se mencionan en otros pasajes cuando Dios dice que convertirá el desierto para florecer. Isa 41:19# a. El árbol de mirto tiene hojas perfumadas de color verde oscuro, delicadas flores blancas estrelladas y bayas de color oscuro, que se comen.# b. Es raro ver un árbol creciendo en el desierto. Un día, la promesa de Dios a Israel es que Él hará florecer el desierto. El árbol de mirto es un recordatorio de esto. Dios convertirá los brezos en árboles de mirto. Isa 55:13# c. El mirto se usaba durante la fiesta de los tabernáculos para construir las cabinas, entre otras cosas. Neh 8:15# d. El nombre de Ester en hebreo es Mirto. Est 2:7# 6. Zacarías 1:8c con caballos rojos, acederas y blancos detrás de él. El hombre entre los árboles de mirto no es el único en un caballo rojo. El ángel no da ninguna otra información con respecto al significado de los colores de los caballos.# a. Hay caballos y carros mencionados en Zacarías 6:2-7 y los cuatro jinetes en Apocalipsis 6. Algunos creen que estos están relacionados y hasta cierto punto pueden estarlo, pero se debe tener cuidado de no argumentar un caso en el que la Escritura está en silencio.# 1) El número de colores diferentes de los caballos mencionados en el capítulo 1 son tres, mientras que en el capítulo 6 hay cuatro.# 2) Dado que el ángel intérprete simplemente ignora los colores, podemos ver que el énfasis de la visión está en otra cosa. Podemos especular sobre el significado de los colores, pero debemos tener cuidado de no ser dogmáticos.# 7. Zacarías 1:9a Entonces dije: \u0026ldquo;Señor mío, ¿qué son estos?\u0026rdquo; Zacarías quiere saber el significado de la visión.# 8. Zacarías 1:9b Y el ángel que estaba hablando conmigo me dijo: \u0026ldquo;Te mostraré lo que son\u0026rdquo;. No es tarea del receptor interpretar algún sueño vago. La explicación de la visión se da para que Zacarías sepa exactamente lo que Dios está comunicando. Apo 1:1, 2 Cor 10:5# 9. Zacarías 1:10a Y el hombre que estaba de pie entre los mirtos respondió y dijo: Zacarías oye al jinete mismo, el Ángel del Señor habla.# 10. Zacarías 1:10b \u0026ldquo;Estos son aquellos a quienes Jehová ha enviado a patrullar la tierra\u0026rdquo;. Evidentemente esta patrulla angelical enviada para recopilar información sobre el estado actual de la tierra.# a. Aunque Satanás es el príncipe y el poder del aire y se le ha dado autoridad sobre la tierra, no significa que Dios no esté en completo control y observando todas las cosas.# 11. Zacarías 1:11a Así que respondieron al ángel del Señor que estaba de pie entre los árboles de mirto Los agentes informan al ángel del Señor de lo que observaron entre las naciones. El ángel del Señor a su vez informará al Padre.# a. Este es el mismo ángel del Señor que luchó por Israel antes y el Rey de Siria se ve obligado a huir. Isaí 37:36-37# b. El término, EL ÁNGEL DEL SEÑOR se puede ver 4 veces diferentes en Zacarías (Zac 1, 3, 6, 12). Este \u0026ldquo;hombre entre los árboles de mirto\u0026rdquo; era el ángel del Señor (vv. 11–13).# 1) Muchos eruditos creen que esta es la segunda Persona de la Deidad, el Hijo de Dios, quien en los tiempos del Antiguo Testamento hace apariciones preencarnadas temporales en la tierra.# c. Las Escrituras registran que el ángel del Señor se apareció a muchas personas a lo largo de la historia.# 1) Agar. Gén 16:7–14# 2) Abraham. Gén 18; 22:11–18# 3) Jacobo. Gén 31:11, 13# 4) Moisés. Éx. 3# 5) Gedeón. Jue. 6:11–23# 6) Los padres de Sansón. Jue 13# 7) José en un sueño antes del nacimiento de Jesús. Mat 1:24# d. El cumplimiento final de esta profecía (la primera visión) será cuando el Mesías sea visto vestido de rojo haciendo la guerra contra las naciones. Apo 19:11-13# 12. Zacarías 1:11b y dijo: \u0026ldquo;Hemos patrullado la tierra, y he aquí, toda la tierra es pacífica y silenciosa\u0026rdquo;. Para el lector, el pensamiento inicial podría ser: \u0026ldquo;¡Paz! ¡Todo está bien!\u0026rdquo;. La respuesta del ángel del Señor refleja que las cosas están lejos de ser correctas para estar en paz.# a. No hay nada de malo en la paz siempre y cuando se alcance de la manera correcta. En este momento de la historia, las naciones gentiles estaban en paz a expensas de la nación de Dios, Israel. Dios no tiene consideración por el camino de paz del hombre aparte de Él.# b. Es cierto que la paz mundial definitiva sólo se alcanzará cuando Jesucristo gobierna desde Su trono desde Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4# c. Según las Escrituras, la paz no llega hasta que Babilonia es destruida. Apo 17-18, Zac 5# 13. Zacarías 1:12 Entonces el ángel del Señor dijo: \u0026ldquo;Oh Señor de los ejércitos, ¿hasta cuánto tiempo no tendrás compasión por Jerusalén y las ciudades de Judá, con las que has estado indignado estos setenta años?\u0026rdquo; Dios había dicho que el tiempo sería de 70 años. El ángel del Señor esencialmente le pregunta a Dios: \u0026ldquo;¿Cuánto tiempo más va a ser tu pueblo?\u0026rdquo; Jer 29:10# a. Al lector se le recuerda el tiempo que Dios había establecido de 70 años para regresar a la tierra, sin embargo, han pasado unos 17 años adicionales y, sin embargo, todavía no hay templo, ni ciudad y todavía se encuentra desprotegida y, sin embargo, \u0026ldquo;la tierra es pacífica y silenciosa\u0026rdquo;. ¡Las naciones estaban bien con que Israel no tuviera la autonomía de su tierra dada por Dios! Jer 29:10, Jer 6:14# b. Las palabras del ángel del Señor reflejan su empatía por el pueblo y su indignación por la injusticia mostrada a Judá y mientras las naciones están \u0026ldquo;en paz\u0026rdquo;.# c. El ángel del Señor intercede ante el Señor en nombre del pueblo. Zac 1:12# 1) De manera similar, Cristo intercede por la iglesia hoy. 1 Joh 2:1, Heb 7:25, Rom 8:34# d. Durante siglos,\u0026quot;¿Cuánto tiempo? \u0026ldquo;ha sido el grito de la gente que sufre, especialmente del pueblo de Israel. Sal 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2# 1) \u0026ldquo;¿Cuánto tiempo? \u0026quot; es también el grito de los santos mártires en el cielo mientras esperan que Dios los venga. Apo 6:10# e. \u0026ldquo;Cuánto tiempo \u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Es sólo para el Señor, Dios el Padre conocer los tiempos y las épocas de las cosas. Hech 1:7# f. Se le dijo a Daniel que el regreso de Israel sería en última instancia de 70 unidades de 7. Esto llega a un total de 490 años. Estos aún tienen que cumplirse en su propósito. Dan 9:24-27# 1) Finalmente, cuando Babilonia (la personificación del reino del hombre a través de las Escrituras) sea destruida, entonces habrá paz. Isaí 14:3-7# g. La mayor demostración de la compasión de Dios está en la entrega de Su Hijo. Él tomó sobre sí los pecados del mundo. Juan 3:16, Rom 5:8, 2 Juan 2:2, 2 Cor 5:21# 14. Zacarías 1:13 El Señor respondió al ángel que estaba hablando conmigo con palabras de gracia, palabras de consuelo. El Señor soberano del universo no se finge con el \u0026ldquo;interrogatorio\u0026rdquo; y responde con palabras amables. Col 4:6# a. Curiosamente, la respuesta del Señor no es al ángel del Señor, sino que está dirigida al ángel intérprete para relacionarlo con Zacarías.# b. Dios respondió con compasión. Uno de los propósitos principales de la profecía es siempre animar y dar esperanza. Conocerte en el lado ganador es una fuente de consuelo.# 15. Zacarías 1:14a Entonces el ángel que estaba hablando conmigo me dijo: \u0026ldquo;Proclama, aying\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Este mensaje no debe mantenerse oculto, debe anunciarse. Como profeta Zacarías, la tarea no es recibir el mensaje por sí mismo, sino relacionar el mensaje de Dios con el pueblo. Heb 1:1-2# a. Esto es en respuesta directa a la petición de intercesión hecha por el ángel del Señor. Zac 1:12# 16. Zacarías 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Así dice jehová de los ejércitos: \u0026ldquo;Estoy extremadamente celoso\u0026hellip; Al lector se le recuerda que el Señor de los ejércitos está lejos de ser indiferente de Su nación.# a. Esto habría sido un recordatorio importante para la gente durante este tiempo en el que parecía que a Dios no le importaba o de alguna manera había olvidado su promesa.# b. Los celos de Dios por Israel significan que Él tiene un fuerte deseo por Israel. Isaí 54:8, Heb 12:6-7# 17. Zacarías 1:14c para Jerusalén y Sión. Muchas veces en las Escrituras, Sión es sinónimo denosotros con Jerusalén. Aquí, el uso de Sión traería a colación la terminología del pacto davídico para el judío. Véase el primer uso de Sión en 2 Sam 5:7, 1 Rey 8:1# a. Dios ha puesto a su rey (David) en el monte Sión. Sión es la montaña en la que el trono del Mesías será establecido en la ciudad de Jerusalén. Sal 2:6, Zac 6:12-13# b. Sión es la montaña en la que se encuentra la casa de Dios, eltemplo. Miq 3:12# c. Sión sirve como un recordatorio para el pueblo de lo que Dios finalmente hará al establecer Su reino y gobernar sobre las naciones. Miq 4:1, 3# d. Se da una profecía a \u0026ldquo;la hija de Sión\u0026rdquo; con respecto a su rey. Esto es cumplido por Jesús que viene montado en la ciudad en un burro. Mat 21:4# e. Sión será el lugar donde Dios impartirá su conocimiento y gloria a las naciones. Miq 4:2# 18. Zacarías 1:15 \u0026ldquo;Pero estoy muy enojado con las naciones que están a gusto; porque mientras yo estaba un poco enojado, ellos prosedían el desastre\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Dios había estado un poco enojado con Israel, que duró 70 años, pero ahora está muy enojado con las naciones.# a. El Señor está muy enojado con las naciones o estando a gusto mientras Su pueblo sufre por la falta de su tierra que Él mismo les había hecho. Las naciones no hicieron nada para ayudar a Judá, de hecho, \u0026ldquo;ellos promovieron el desastre\u0026rdquo;. Se fueron diréctamente contra Israel. Zac 1:11, Jer 6:14# b. El Señor también había dicho que esto sucedería e incluso había prometido castigar a las naciones (específicamente en este caso los caldeos) por su duro trato a los judíos. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1# 19. Zacarías 1:16a \u0026lsquo;Por lo tanto, dice Jehová: \u0026ldquo;Volveré a Jerusalén con compasión\u0026hellip; Podemos estar seguros de que todo lo que está a punto de decirse es para proporcionar consuelo.# 20. Zacarías 1:16b Mi casa será edificada en ella\u0026rdquo;, declara el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, \u0026ldquo;y una línea de medición será esparcida sobre Jerusalén\u0026rdquo;. Después de décadas de la demolición del templo y pulverización de la ciudad, el favor de Dios a Israel volverá a ser visible cuando se vea el templo reconstruido y Jerusalén una ciudad donde se vean definidas las fronteras.# a. Unos 200 años antes, Dios había anunciado a través del profeta Isaías que Él haría esto. \u0026ldquo;El que dice de Ciro: “Él es Mi pastor, Y él cumplirá todos Mis deseos”, Y dice de Jerusalén: “Será reedificada”, Y al templo: “Serán echados tus cimientos”». Isa 44:28# b. Zacarías agrega más información a la profecía de Isaías. Será bajo Zorobabel que el templo será reconstruido. Zac 4:9-10# 21. Zacarías 1:17a \u0026ldquo;Una vez más, proclama, diciendo: Vemos un ejemplo de cómo Dios habla varias veces y de diferentes maneras, por lo que todos tienen una amplia oportunidad de escuchar lo que está a punto de hacer. Isaí 65:2, Rom 10:21# 22. Zacarías 1:17b \u0026lsquo;Así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos: \u0026ldquo;Mis ciudades volverán a rebosar de prosperidad, y Jehová volverá a consolar a Sión y volverá a elegir Jerusalén\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; El Señor de los ejércitos (el que lucha por ellos) promete traer prosperidad desbordante a las ciudades de Judá, con un énfasis especial en Sión y Jerusalén. Zac 6:15# a. Mientras que la profecía del versículo 16 parece estar conectada con el tiempo de Zacarías, el versículo 17 es claramente aún futuro, ya que aún no ha sucedido.# b. La profecía siempre es dada por Dios de una manera que cuando se cumple \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip; sabrás que yo soy el Señor\u0026rdquo; Ex 6:7# 1) Cuando Dios perdona a la nación de Israel por sus pecados y se restablecen en una relación correcta con Él. Zac 13:9# 2) Cuando Dios hace que las personas se establezcan en la tierra y se vuelvan fructíferas y prósperas. Eze 36:11# 3) Cuando Dios se muestra santo a través de Israel ante los ojos de las naciones. Eze 36:23# 4) Cuando Dios reconstruye lo que fue destruido y replanta lo que estaba desolado. Eze 36:36.# 5) Cuando Dios llena las ciudades reconstruidas con gente. Eze 36:38# 6) Cuando Dios trae de vuelta a la vida a un pueblo muerto hace mucho tiempo. Eze 37:6.# 7) Cuando Dios abre sus tumbas y levanta a su pueblo de sulugar. Eze 37:13# 8) Cuando Dios pone su espíritu en ellos y los asienta en su propia tierra. Eze 37:14# 9) Cuando el santuario de Dios está entre ellos para siempre. Eze 37:28# 10) Cuando Dios derrota a la coalición Gog Magog. Eze 38:23# 11) Cuando Dios termine de traer a su pueblo de vuelta a Israel, sin dejar a ninguno atrás. Eze 39:28# 23. Nunca habrá paz completa en la tierra hasta que se cumpla el propósito de Dios de reconstruir y establecer a Israel como Él prometió. Jer 8:11, Apo 17:14# 24. Sólo Jesucristo traerá paz a la tierra cuando el gobierno esté sobre sus hombros en el reino milenario. Esto ocurre después de que Babilonia es destruida. Isaí 9:6-7, 2 Ped 3:13, Apo 17-19# a. Hoy el creyente de la edad de la iglesia, espiritualmente tiene paz para con Dios y puede experimentar paz con Dios cuando camina por la fe. Rom 5:1, Fil 4:6-7# # B. Zacarías 1:18-21 La visión de cuatro cuernos y cuatro artesanos# 1. Zacarías 1:18 Después alcé mis ojos y miré, y he aquí cuatro cuernos. Los cuernos utilizados de esta manera, típicamente representan poderes políticos, líderes nacionales o naciones. Sal 75:10, Jer 48:25, Dan 7:24, 8, Apo 12, 13, 17# 2. Zacarías 1:19a Y dije al ángel que hablaba conmigo: ¿Qué son éstos? Y me respondió: Éstos son los cuernos que dispersaron…\u0026rdquo; No se nos da la identidad de estos cuernos, excepto que son naciones gentíles. Existen al menos dos opciones principales.# a. Opción 1: Los cuatro cuernos ya habían llegado. Esto podría referirse a las naciones desus naciones (caldeos, sirios, moabitas y amonitas) que Dios usó para dispersar a Judá. 2 Rey 24:2# b. Opción 2: Los cuatro cuernos habían comenzado pero aún no se han completado. La dispersión es en referencia a Judá. Babilonia sería la primera, entonces Medo Persia y luego Grecia serían todos culpables. El cuarto se referiría a Roma que de una manera u otra continúa hoy. Jer 50:17-18, Eze 34:11-24# 1) Esta opción parece ser la opción más aceptable.# 2) Esta opción también se alinearía con los cuatro cuernos de Daniel. Dan 7# 3. Zacarías 1:19b a Judá, a Israel y a Jerusalén\u0026hellip; ¿Es importante el orden dado? Más tarde estos se resumen como Judá. Zac 1:21# 4. Zacarías 1:20 Me mostró luego Jehová cuatro carpinteros. El Señor estaba interesado en que Zacarías viera sobre cuatro artesanos.# a. Los artesanos eran trabajadores calificados en metal o en madera. Os 13:2, 2 Cro 29:5# 5. Zacarías 1:21 “Y yo dije: ¿Qué vienen éstos a hacer? Y me respondió, diciendo: Aquéllos son los cuernos que dispersaron a Judá, tanto que ninguno alzó su cabeza; mas éstos han venido para hacerlos temblar, para derribar los cuernos de las naciones que alzaron el cuerno sobre la tierra de Judá para dispersarla”. A pesar de que los cuernos dispersarían a Judá, los cuatro artesanos aterrorizarían a estas naciones y las arrojarían. Isa 44:28# a. Esto fue para alentar al lector a que, aunque las cosas parecieran impotentes, podían poner su esperanza y confianza en la palabra del Señor para saber quién tendría finalmente la última palabra.# b. En última instancia, la desaparición de Roma (el cuarto cuerno) es por el artesano que viene del cielo, la Roca no hecha con manos que destruye toda la estatua. Dan 2# # C. Zacarías 2:1-13 La visión de la medición de Jerusalén# 1. Zacarías 2:1 Entonces levanté los ojos y miré, y he aquí, había un hombre con una línea de medición en la mano. Zacarías entonces ve a un hombre que tenía un instrumento para medir en su mano.# 2. Zacarías 2:2 Así que dije: \u0026ldquo;¿A dónde vas?\u0026rdquo; Y me dijo: \u0026ldquo;Medir Jerusalén, ver qué tan ancha es y cuánto tiempo es\u0026rdquo;. Zacarías parece desconcertado en cuanto a dónde podría ir el hombre.# a. En el año 586 a.C., unos 60 años antes, los babilonios habían destruido Jerusalén y el templo. Se exiliaron a todos, excepto a los más pobres de la tierra, que finalmente se rebelaron contra el hombre que quedó a cargo y huyeron a Egipto por temor a los babilonios. 2 Rey 24-25, Jer 39, 52, 2 Cr 36: 17-21# 3. Zacarías 2:3 Y he aquí, el ángel que estaba hablando conmigo estaba saliendo, y otro ángel estaba saliendo a su encuentro, Ahora Zacarías ve al ángel interpretante saliendo al encuentro de otro ángel.# 4. Zacarías 2:4 y le dijo: \u0026ldquo;Corre, habla con ese joven, diciendo: \u0026lsquo;Jerusalén será habitada sin muros debido a la multitud de hombres y ganado dentro de ella. ¡El otro ángel le dice al ángel intérprete que corra y le cuente a Zacarías sobre el futuro estado de Jerusalén!# a. Esta es la explicación a la visión del hombre que va a medir Jerusalén. Zac 2:1-2# b. En la primera visión, Dios habíadicho: \u0026ldquo;Volveré a Jerusalén con compasión; Mi casa será construida en ella\u0026rdquo;, declara el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, \u0026ldquo;y una línea de medición se extenderá sobre Jerusalén. \u0026quot; Zac 1:16# c. ¡Saber que un día Jerusalén será reconstruida con el templo en medio de ella y la ciudad llena de multitudes de hombres y ganado habría sido de gran aliento! De hecho, esto promovería la iniciativa para la reconstrucción del templo.# 1) Sin esperanza es muy difícil comenzar un nuevo esfuerzo. La esperanza permite \u0026ldquo;ver\u0026rdquo; lo bueno en el futuro, incluso tal vez, a pesar de los tiempos difíciles en el presente para seguir adelante. 1 Tim 4:10, 1 Tim 5: 5, 1 Jn 3: 3# 5. Zacarías 2:5-13 El Señor Jesucristo predice que será enviado por el Señor de los Ejércitos al mundo. Él morará en medio de Israel una vez más y las naciones se unirán a ella.# 6. Zacarías 2:5 \u0026lsquo;Porque yo\u0026rsquo;, declara Jehová, \u0026lsquo;será un muro de fuego a su alrededor, y yo seré la gloria en medio de ella\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;. el Señor aquí es Cristo. Él mismo dice que será la fuente de gloria desde dentro y el impenetrable muro de fuego protector alrededor de la ciudad. Zafa 3:15, Lucas 2:25-32, Mateo 25:31,# 7. Zacarías 2:6 \u0026quot;¡Ho! Huid de la tierra del norte\u0026rdquo;, declara Jehová, \u0026ldquo;porque os he dispersado como los cuatro vientos de los cielos\u0026rdquo;, declara el Señor. Aunque esto es cierto en el tiempo de Zacarías durante la dispersión causada por los **asirios,**esto se refiere al fin delos tiempos.# 8. Zacarías 2:7 \u0026quot;¡Ho, Sión! Escapad, vosotros que estáis viviendo con la hija de Babilonia\u0026rdquo;. Babilonia está al este de Jerusalén.# a. Dos entidades religiosas se contrastan aquí. Sión e hija de Babilonia. El daugher de Sión se refiere a aquellos israelitas que ponen su confianza en Dios mientras que la hija de Babilonia es el sistema caldeo de religión. Isaías 47, Sal 137:8, Apocalipsis 17# 1) Esto es lo mismo con el sistema religioso iniciado en Babel que continúa hasta el final del gobierno del hombre. Apocalipsis 17:5# 9. Zacarías 2:8a Porque así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos: \u0026ldquo;Después de la gloria, me ha enviado contra las naciones que os saquean\u0026hellip; Dios envía al Señor contra las naciones para traer gloria. Psa 2# 10. El enviado por Dios no es otro que **Dios,**el señor de los ejércitos mismo.# 11. Zacarías 2:8b porque el que te toca, toca la niña de sus ojos. Dios está profundamente dedicado a Su posesión, Israel. ¡El que toca la niña de sus ojos (Israel), va en contra del mismo Señor de los ejércitos! Deut 32:9-10# a. La Iglesia es también la posesión preciada de Dios. Cristo pagó un costo muy alto para redimirla. Él dio su propia vida por ella. 1 Pedro 1:18-19# 12. Zacarías 2:9a \u0026ldquo;Porque he aquí, agitaré Mi mano sobre ellos para que saqueen a sus esclavos. Dios cambiará todo. Las naciones planean y trabajan contra Dios, sin embargo, Dios finalmente las destrozará como loza y les dará a las naciones como herencia a Su Hijo. Psa 2, Psa 110# 13. Zacarías 2:9b Entonces sabrás que el SEÑOR de los ejércitos me ha enviado. Esta frase aparece 4 veces en Zacarías Dios siempre está buscando que el cumplimiento de las Escrituras sea literal y para que todos sepan que es como Él dijo que sería.# 14. Zacarías está prediciendo acerca de Dios enviando a Su Hijo al mundo. Gal 4:4, 1 Jn 4:9-10, Jn 3:16# a. Desde el principio de los tiempos, Dios prometió enviar un libertador. La gente ha estado depositando su confianza en esta esperanza desde aquel entonces. Gen 3:15,# b. El rey David estaba lleno de esperanza sabiendo que un día el Redentor resucitaría de entre los muertos. Su esperanza estaba en el Señor. Hechos 2:25-31, 24:15# c. Contra toda esperanza, Abraham esperaba (creía) en el salvador venidero. Joh 8:56# d. Isaías profetizó que un día nosotros, los gentiles, pondríamos su esperanza en el Mesías. Romanos 15:12, Mat 12:21# e. Somos salvos en la esperanza de las promesas de Dios, lo cual es algo seguro para todos aquellos que creen en el Evangelio. Heb 11:1, Rom 8:24-25, 2 Corintios 1:10, Gal 5:5, Ef 4:4, Col 1:5, Teta 1:2# f. Poner la fe en Jesucristo es esperar en quién es Él y lo que ha hecho y sus promesas a nosotros. Efesios 1:12, Efesios 1:18, Col 1:5, Col 1:23, Tetas 1:2, Tetas 3:7# g. Cristo mismo es nuestra esperanza. Nuestra esperanza es algo seguro que no depende de nuestro buen comportamiento, sino de su obra completa y aceptada de la cruz. 1 Tim 1:1, Tit 2:13, 1 Pedro 1:3# h. Como creyentes podemos abundar en esperanza mientras caminamos por fe. Rom 15:13, Col 1:27, Heb 10:23, 1 Pedro 1:13, 1 Tim 4:10, Heb 6:18-20# 15. Zacarías 2:10 \u0026ldquo;Cantad de gozo y alegraos, oh hija de Sión; porque he aquí que vengo y habitaré en medio de vosotros\u0026rdquo;, declara el Señor. El Señor mismo, el Hijo de Dios morará en medio de ella. Joh 1:14,# 16. Aunque Jesús vino y habitó corporalmente en Israel, el cumplimiento final y eterno de esto es durante el reinado mesiánico. Apocalipsis 21:3# 17. Aquí la hija de Sión se coloca en contraste con la hija de Babilonia.# a. En última instancia, Dios triunfará sobre el sistema del hombre. Saber que son uno de los bandos ganadores fue una verdad alentadora a la que aferrarse en un momento de desesperación. Zac 9:9# 18. Zacarías 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Muchas naciones se unirán al Señor en ese día y se convertirán en Mi pueblo. Claramente una referencia al día del Señor cuando las naciones serán dependientes y estarán directamente conectadas a través del gobiernodeIsrael.# a. Alrededor de 20 referencias de \u0026ldquo;en esedía\u0026ldquo;se encuentran en Zacarías.# 1) Cuando Dios regrese y consuele a Jerusalén.# 2) Cuando Dios defiende a los habitantes de Jerusalén. Zac 12:6# 3) Cuando Dios destruya a las naciones que se enfrenten a Jerusalén. Zac 12:3, 9# 4) Cuando Dios elimine toda idolatría de la tierra. Zac 13:2# 5) Cuando el Mesías está de pie en el monte de los Olivos. Él reinará sobre toda la tierra desde Sión. Zac 14:4, 9# 19. Zacarías 2:11b Entonces habitaré en medio de vosotros, y sabréis que el SEÑOR de los ejércitos me ha enviado a vosotros. Mesías, Dios mismo en la persona de Jesucristo un día morará en medio de ellos para siempre.# 20. Zacarías 2:12 \u0026ldquo;Jehová poseerá a Judá como Su porción en tierra santa, y volverá a elegir Jerusalén. Aunque Israel fue escogido por Dios en el pasado y se le dieron promesas maravillosas y eternas, en el presente Dios ha puesto Su programa con ellos en espera. Sin embargo, en el día del Señor, Dios una vez más obrará directamente en y a través de Israel. Deut 32:9, Rom 11:11-12, 25# 21. Zacarías 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Callaos, toda carne, delante de Jehová; porque Él se despierta de Su santa morada\u0026rdquo;. Dios está enojado por la situación actual y la laxitud de las naciones con respecto a Su nación, Su pueblo, Su tierra, Su ciudad, Jerusalén y especialmente Su casa, el templo.# D. Zacarías 3:1-10 - El sumo sacerdote# Zacarías 3:1 \u0026ldquo;Entonces me mostró al sumo sacerdote Josué, que estaba delante del ángel del SEÑOR; y Satanás estaba a su derecha para acusarlo.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:2 \u0026ldquo;Y el ángel del SEÑOR dijo a Satanás: «El SEÑOR te reprenda, Satanás. Repréndate el SEÑOR que ha escogido a Jerusalén. ¿No es este un tizón arrebatado del fuego?».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:3 \u0026ldquo;Josué estaba vestido de ropas sucias, en pie delante del ángel.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:4 \u0026ldquo;Y este habló, y dijo a los que estaban delante de él: «Quítenle las ropas sucias». Y a él le dijo: «Mira, he quitado de ti tu iniquidad y te vestiré con ropas de gala».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:5 \u0026ldquo;Después dijo: «Que le pongan un turbante limpio en la cabeza». Y le pusieron un turbante limpio en la cabeza y le vistieron con ropas de gala; y el ángel del SEÑOR estaba allí.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:6 \u0026ldquo;Entonces el ángel del SEÑOR amonestó a Josué, diciendo:\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:7 \u0026quot;«Así dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos: “Si andas en Mis caminos, y si guardas Mis ordenanzas, también tú gobernarás Mi casa. Además tendrás a tu cargo Mis atrios y te daré libre acceso entre estos que están aquí.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:8 \u0026ldquo;Escucha ahora, Josué, sumo sacerdote, tú y tus compañeros que se sientan ante ti, que son hombres de presagio, pues Yo voy a traer a Mi siervo, el Renuevo.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:9 \u0026ldquo;Porque la piedra que he puesto delante de Josué, sobre esta única piedra hay siete ojos. Yo grabaré una inscripción en ella”, declara el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, “y quitaré la iniquidad de esta tierra en un solo día.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 3:10 \u0026ldquo;Aquel día”, declara el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, “convidarán cada uno a su prójimo bajo su parra y bajo suhiguera”».\u0026rdquo;# E. Zacarías 4:1-14 - El candelabro y los olivos# Zacarías 4:1 \u0026ldquo;Entonces el ángel que hablaba conmigo volvió, y me despertó como a un hombre que es despertado de su sueño.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:2 \u0026ldquo;Y me preguntó: «¿Qué ves?». Y respondí: «Veo un candelabro todo de oro con su depósito en la parte superior, y sus siete lámparas encima de él con siete tubos para cada una de las lámparas que tiene encima;\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:3 \u0026ldquo;y junto a él hay dos olivos, uno a la derecha del depósito y el otro a la izquierda».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:4 \u0026ldquo;Continué, y dije al ángel que hablaba conmigo: «¿Qué es esto señor mío?».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:5 \u0026ldquo;Respondió el ángel que hablaba conmigo, y me dijo: «¿No sabes qué es esto?». «No, señor mío», respondí.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:6 \u0026ldquo;Continuó él, y me dijo: «Esta es la palabra del SEÑOR a Zorobabel: “No por el poder ni por la fuerza, sino por Mi Espíritu”, dice el SEÑOR de los ejércitos.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:7 \u0026quot;“¿Quién eres tú, oh gran monte? Ante Zorobabel te convertirás en llanura; y él sacará la piedra clave entre aclamaciones de ‘¡Gracia, gracia a ella!’”».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:8 \u0026ldquo;Y vino a mí la palabra del SEÑOR:\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:9 \u0026quot;«Las manos de Zorobabel han puesto los cimientos de esta casa, y sus manos la acabarán. Entonces sabrán que el SEÑOR de los ejércitos me ha enviado a ustedes.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:10 \u0026quot;¿Pues quién ha despreciado el día de las pequeñeces? Estos siete se alegrarán cuando vean la plomada en la mano de Zorobabel; estos son los ojos del SEÑOR que recorren toda la tierra».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:11 \u0026ldquo;Entonces le pregunté: «¿Qué son estos dos olivos a la derecha y a la izquierda del candelabro?».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:12 \u0026ldquo;Hablé por segunda vez, y le pregunté: «¿Qué son las dos ramas de olivo que están junto a los dos tubos de oro, que vierten de sí el aceite dorado?».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:13 \u0026ldquo;Y me respondió: «¿No sabes qué son estos?». Y yo le contesté: «No, señor mío».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 4:14 \u0026ldquo;Entonces él dijo: «Estos son los dos ungidos que están de pie junto al Señor de toda la tierra».\u0026rdquo;# F. Zacarías 5:1-4 - El rollo y el efa# Zacarías 5:1 \u0026ldquo;Alcé de nuevo mis ojos y miré un rollo que volaba.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:2 \u0026ldquo;Y el ángel me dijo: «¿Qué ves?». Y respondí: «Veo un rollo que vuela; su longitud es de 20 codos (9 metros) y su anchura de 10 codos (4.5 metros)».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:3 \u0026ldquo;Entonces me dijo: «Esta es la maldición que sale sobre la superficie de toda la tierra. Ciertamente todo el que roba será destruido según lo escrito en un lado, y todo el que jura será destruido según lo escrito en el otro lado.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:4 \u0026ldquo;La haré salir», declara el SEÑOR de los ejércitos, «y entrará en casa del ladrón y en casa del que jura por Mi nombre en falso; y pasará la noche dentro de su casa y la consumirá junto con sus maderas y sus piedras».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:5 \u0026ldquo;Entonces el ángel que hablaba conmigo salió y me dijo: «Alza ahora tus ojos y mira qué es esto que sale».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:6 \u0026ldquo;Y pregunté: «¿Qué es?». «Esto es el efa (una cesta de 22 litros) que sale», dijo él. Y añadió: «Esta es la iniquidad de ellos en toda la tierra.\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:7 \u0026ldquo;Entonces una tapa de plomo fue levantada, y había una mujer sentada dentro del efa».\u0026rdquo;# Zacarías 5:8 \u0026ldquo;Entonces dijo: «Esta es la Maldad».

      "content":"Zechariah - The restoration of Israel through the deliverance of Messiah# A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows\u0026hellip; — Psalm 68:5 You, LORD, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror. — Psalm 10:17–18 God is a father to the fatherless, a defender of the widow. He encourages the afflicted and listens to their cry.\nThe book of Zechariah contains a powerful message to the reader. One\u0026rsquo;s view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does.\nGod is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah.\nUnder the current circumstances it would appear as though God had forgotten Israel. The prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message is to show them that God remembers and in His appointed time will return to them in blessing. This offer is always before Israel yet they reject Him over and over. Eventually Israel will be brought through a great Tribulation and only then will the the prophecies of Zechariah be fully accomplished. It will be when God remembers Israel at His appointed time and where the blessings will never fade away again.\nI. Zechariah - Background# A. Historical setting# 1. Zechariah (Yahweh remembers) is a beautiful reminder of who God is, who His plan will be carried out through and some details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.# 2. Zechariah is a post-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C.# a. The Jews have returned back in the land for about 18 years after being exiled for 70 years in Babylon. Medo-Persia has overthrown the Babylonians and under Cyrus the Persian the command is given for the Jews to be allowed to go back.# b. Zerubbabel has been placed in charge as governor and is given some finances for the rebuilding of the temple.# 3. Upon first arriving, the Jews immediately set to build an altar to renew the sacrifices. Following that, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple.# a. This caused a lot of interest on behalf of the Samaritans who wanted to help rebuild the temple. Their help was refused because though they feared God, they served other gods as well. Ezra 4:1-3, 2 Kings 17:33# b. When the Jews refused their help however, they proceeded to make all sorts of trouble, telling the persian king that they should be prohibited to rebuild. Ezra 4:4-24# c. Somehow, in the change of power, the command to go back and rebuild was lost and the current king, Darius I had to go back through years of records and verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12# 4. After more than 16 years of waiting, king Darius I finds Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s decree and granted the rebuilding to continue. Ezra 6:1-5# 5. Two months prior to the prophecy of Zechariah, God had told the Jews through the prophet Haggai to begin work again on the temple. The Jews are discouraged and have lost hope.# 6. The message of Zechariah is one that is intended to encourage Israel not only to return to the land and to rebuild the temple but more importantly, to a spiritual return to the Lord.# B. General Information# Structure of the book Zechariah 1:1-6 Introduction Zechariah 1:7-6 Eight visions Zechariah 7-8 Four messages Zechariah 9-14 Two burdens Key Term: The Messiah of Israel is Presented C. Why study the book of Zechariah?# 1. The book of Zechariah is written directly to the Jews who were returning from the 70 year exile in Babylon.# a. It is a message of encouragement, of hope and and restoration.# b. It is because of the message of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the temple will continue and 4 years later be completed. Ezra 6:14# 2. We would do well to learn from this book. The New Testament quotes or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.# a. Not only does it unfold details of prophecy, it reveals behind-the-scenes spiritual warfare# b. It shows how God is in control and never forgets his promises# c. Most importantly, it reveals to us the person of Christ (Revelation 19:10).# d. It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father prior to his first coming.# e. It shows us his nature during his first coming and finally his galant entry and conquest on his second return as conquering king.# f. It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological unfolding of the future but rather to present to us the very purpose of prophecy - the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God\u0026rsquo;s plan of restoration.# g. Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s immediate audience as well as the generations to follow, including the church age, would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He chose to make unconditional promises to Abraham and He will keep his word. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally. Genesis 12:1-3,# 3. Zechariah is a book that is seldom taught as it undoubtedly presents the interpreter with many challenges.# a. While Zechariah presents many future events and gives details regarding those events, the key to understanding Zechariah is not to reveal future historical narrative. Instead all the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah, Christ the Lord.# II. Zechariah 1:1-6 - Message #1 - Introduction, God\u0026rsquo;s call to return# A. Zechariah 1:1-2 Date and Author# 1. Zechariah 1:1a In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,… Cyrus was the Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the writing of Zechariah in 520 B.C..# a. The dating is not according to a Jewish leader as other Old Testament books. The dates the writing of the book are in reference to a Gentile king because Daniel\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo; is now underway. No Jewish king is reigning and Jerusalem is being trampled underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24# 1) Perhaps many in Israel believed Messiah would now come since the 70 years of Jeremiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy are complete and they are coming back to the land.# 2) Cyrus is mistakenly called the Messiah by the people because he let them return. However, God was using Cyrus as king to return the people back to their land. Isaiah 45:1-5# 2. Zechariah 1:1b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,… Zechariah was a levite, born in Babylon (Nehemiah 12:1, 16). Zechariah means Yahweh remembers.# a. Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah is both priest (Nehemiah 12:16) and prophet. Ezra 5:1, 6:14# b. Zechariah is probably a young man. Zechariah 2:4# 2) Haggai prophesied in September, October and December. However, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s first prophecy was in November. Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy complemented the message given by an older prophet.# c. Some scholars ascribe Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah.# 3. Zechariah 1:1c the son of Berechiah,… Berechiah was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra. Not much else is known about Berechiah except that his name means Yahweh blesses.# a. Curiously, Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called Zechariah son of Berechiah in Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions a martyrd Zechariah but leaves Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s name out. Luke 11:51# 1) Option 1: A case of mixed identity. There was another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was killed by the people (2 Chronicles 24:20-22). Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. This theory claims since they mean the same, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus.# 2) Option 2: Same ancestors. Both Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s may have had fathers named Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually somewhere in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s geneology.# 3) Option 3: Copying error. An copyists\u0026rsquo;s error in transcription of the Greek text.# 4) Option 4: Only God witnessed it. Though no one else saw, Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder, just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s. This seems the most plausible option of the 4.# i) The Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also states that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. The rabbis would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus.# ii) Matthew seems familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus mention it this way.# iii) God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He sees all that is done in public as well as in secret. Ultimately he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20# 4. Zechariah 1:1d the son of Iddo… Iddo is Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. His name means the appointed time.# a. Iddo was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 4# b. Zechariah is also referred to as the son of Iddo. This is common practice in the Old Testament to say his forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14# 5. Together, the names of Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time\u0026rdquo;. When the set time comes, God will fulfill all His promises and will be carried out in blessing.# B. Zechariah 1:2-3 Thesis of the book, \u0026ldquo;return to Me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo;# 1. Zechariah 1:2 \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers.… the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36# 2. Zechariah 1:3a \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them,… (the people who have returned)# 3. Zechariah 1:3b Thus says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo; word to the people.# a. this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua.# b. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God\u0026rsquo;s word. Hebrews 1:1, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:20-21# 4. THE LORD OF HOSTS (Yahweh Saboath):# a. The Lord of Hosts is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. In order to properly understand the book of Zechariah we must get better acquainted with this name.# b. THE LORD OF HOST IS COMMANDER OF ARMIES# 1) (Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of armies used 235 times in the Bible).# i) Tza-va (צבא ) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the plural, referring to multiple armies of which include angelic beings.# 2) Isaiah 13:4 \u0026hellip;The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3# 3) 1 Kings 22:19 \u0026hellip;I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many.# 4) Isaiah 19:16 \u0026hellip;they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip;Awake to punish all the nations\u0026hellip; Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7# 5) Nahum 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am against you,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.\u0026rdquo; Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matthew 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20# 6) Luke 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying\u0026hellip; Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53# 7. Isaiah 37:35-36 \u0026lsquo;For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead.# c. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS KING:# 1) Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19# 2) Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# 3) Isaiah 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14# d. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE REDEEMER:# 1) Isaiah 47:4 Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel.# 2) Isaiah 44:6 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: \u0026lsquo;I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me. Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5# 3) Psalm 84:1-12 \u0026hellip;.How blessed is the man who trusts in You!# e. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HOLY:# 1) Isaiah 6:3 \u0026ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16# f. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS ALMIGHTY:# 1) \u0026ldquo;All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN \u0026amp; among the inhabitants of earth \u0026amp; no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, \u0026lsquo;What have You done?\u0026rdquo; Daniel 4:35# 2) Hannah is the first person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. 1 Samuel 1# 3) David invokes the Lord of Hosts when going before Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10# i) Though David didn\u0026rsquo;t use Saul\u0026rsquo;s armor, he put on the Lord of Hosts.# ii) David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27# A Mighty Fortress is our God (Martin Luther)\nA mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing: For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe; His craft and pow\u0026rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate, On earth is not his equal.\nDid we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing; Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God\u0026rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he; Lord Sabaoth is his name, from age to age the same, And He must win the battle.\nAnd though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us, We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us; The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him; His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure, One little word shall fell him.\nThat word above all earthly pow\u0026rsquo;rs, no thanks to them, abideth; The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth; Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also; The body they may kill: God\u0026rsquo;s truth abideth still, His kingdom is forever.\ng. The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in understanding that it is the Lord of Hosts who is actively involved with the protection, provision and ultimate destiny of Israel. He is the Almighty, great Commander, the One who battles in favour of his people.# 1) Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message comes directly from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to see to properly understand the message.# 2) It is the Lord of Hosts who will ultimately not allow injustice to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8# 3) When Christ reigns on the earth on His throne, He will be called Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16-17# 5. Zechariah 1:3c \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026quot;… While Haggai is more focused on the return to the land and the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message is to encourage the people to return to a right relationship with God.# a. The Jews needed to place their focus and trust in the giver and purpose of the temple, not the temple itself. 1 John 3:3# b. That is why in Zechariah, God will reveal the person of Messiah. The book of Zechariah will present Christ as:# 1) the Angel (Messenger) of the Lord. Zechariah 1:11# 2) the man. Zechariah 13:7, 1:10# 3) The Branch. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12# 4) God\u0026rsquo;s Associate. Zechariah 13:7# 5) The Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7# 6) Priest. Zechariah 6:13# 7) The King. Zechariah 9:9, 14:16# 8) The Redeemer. Zechariah# 9) God\u0026rsquo;s Servant. Zechariah 3:8# 10) the Stone. Zechariah# 11) Lord of the whole earth. Zechariah 4:14, Revelation 11:4# 12) The Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16# c. The opposite of return is to forsake. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and needed to walk with God in faith. The result would be God\u0026rsquo;s returning to them as the Lord of hosts to defend and fight for His nation.# 6. Zechariah 1:3d declares the LORD of hosts,… The Lord of hosts declares Israel to return, not merely to the land but to himself. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are back in the land, they have rebuilt the altar and laid the foundation for the temple. It\u0026rsquo;s appears as though things are going well apart from the opposition from the Samaritans.# a. Perhaps Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message should be rather, rebuild the temple no matter the obstacles, just get it done! Yet, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, they must first of all return to Him by faith. This, perhaps was totally overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances.# b. So, when a little trial comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, simply trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11# 7. Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God\u0026rsquo;s presence among the people. Haggai\u0026rsquo;s prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple.# a. The Lord of hosts is inviting Israel to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart with himself.# C. Zechariah 1:4-6 An Illustration showing the antithesis of returning to the Lord# 1. In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will say to the Jews what it is not.# 2. Zechariah 1:4a \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers,… 2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8# a. In other words God says, when I say \u0026ldquo;return to me\u0026rdquo; it is the opposite to what your fathers had done, don\u0026rsquo;t be like that!.# 3. Zechariah 1:4b to whom the former prophets proclaimed,… namely; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10# 3. Zechariah 1:4c *saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;…*Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10# 5. Zechariah 1:4d But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.… They weren\u0026rsquo;t deaf or somehow unaware of God speaking time and time again through the prophets. They were rebellious and refused to listen. Jeremiah 44:16# a. Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place. A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil things but a return to fellowship.# 1) A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external).# b. God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27, Colossians 2:23# c. God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4# 1) It is counted as violence to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4# 2) In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23# d. This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. The arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be rebuilt. Haggai 1:2# 1) Once again, God disciplined them with a drought and still they did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17# 6. Zechariah 1:5a \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they?… The fathers had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10# 7. Zechariah 1:5b And the prophets, do they live forever?… Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to.# a. God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvatión is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2# 8. Zechariah 1:6a \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, whiJmch I commanded My servants the prophets,…# 9. Zechariah 1:6b overtake your fathers?… Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still sends more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God\u0026rsquo;s commands are still the same, even today# 10. Zechariah 1:6c Then they repented and said,… the word for repent (SHUB) could be better translated here \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; as it\u0026rsquo;s referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. Compare the use of SHUB in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6# 11. Zechariah 1:6d As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.…# a. 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers . This including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70# b. Though many returned physically, their focus was on the land and the temple and on the blessings, not on the giver of those blessings. \u0026ldquo;Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, \u0026lsquo;This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; Jeremiah 7:4, 8# 12. A NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel.# a. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome\u0026rsquo;s Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one\u0026rsquo;s thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent.# 1) The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original Greek word metanoia (change your mind).# b. We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, \u0026lsquo;return\u0026rsquo;. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not.# c. They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them. This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized.# 1) That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for all sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God.# 2) Israel needed approach God by faith. To merely admit sinning and accepting the consequences from God is not the same as approaching God by faith. One must trust in God\u0026rsquo;s provision for sin.# d. The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of thinking, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said. Ezekiel 20:43# 1) It\u0026rsquo;s not merely recognizing the wrong you have done. It\u0026rsquo;s not a focus on the admission of guilt. Matthew 27:3-5# 2) It\u0026rsquo;s not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words.# 3) It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9# 4) It\u0026rsquo;s not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.# 5) It\u0026rsquo;s not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance. This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today. The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic. Luke 3:8-18,# 6) Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God, you change your thinking from what you are trusting in to trust God. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1# 7) For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5# 8) Or for a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16# 9) The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him.# 10) Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, \u0026ldquo;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote, Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.\u0026rdquo; Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, \u0026ldquo;Who sees us?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Who knows us?\u0026rdquo; You turn things around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, \u0026ldquo;He did not make me\u0026rdquo;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, \u0026ldquo;He has no understanding\u0026rdquo;?# 11) God wanted this Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith.# 12) \u0026ldquo;Return to me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo; - God# 13) “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”. James 4:8 NKJV# III. Zechariah 1:1-6 - Message #2 - Eight Visions# A. Zechariah received 8 visions in one night. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some would be fulfilled partially within the near future but others have yet to be fulfilled.# B. These vision will serve to encourage the people of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time to finish the temple. They also serve to give hope for future generations as they describe how God is compassionate and faithful towards Israel and his plans to make Israel the# C. We will try not to discifer every detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know.# 1. Each of the visions follow a similar pattern.# a. What Zechariah saw# b. Zechariah asks what it means# c. Someone will respond Zechariah with the significance# Vision Meaning 1 Horseman Zechariah 1:7-17: God is jealous for Israel. God is prepared to fight the nations for Israel\u0026rsquo;s restoration and bring justice and through it, world peace. 2 Horns and craftsmen Zechariah 1:18-21: The nations who have scattered Israel will be thrown down. 3 Measuring Jerusalem Zechariah 2:1-13: Jerusalem will be restored 4 High Priest Zechariah 3:1-10: Though Israel (particularly the priesthood) has not walked as they should, God will one day restore Israel. 5 Olive Trees Zechariah 4:1-14: God empowers his people through His Spirit. 7 The Ephah Zechariah 5:5-11: Wickedness of Shinar is restrained. 6 The Flying Scroll Zechariah 5:1-4: Righteous judgement; first on God\u0026rsquo;s people, then on the nations of the world. 8 Four Chariots Zechariah 6:1-15: God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom is established with Messiah as King of the earth. A. Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the patrol of the earth# 1. Zechariah 1:7a On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, in the Bible there are no Hebrew names given for months. The names we have were acquired from the Babylonians.# a. Moses gave the law to the second generation on the \u0026ldquo;11th month\u0026rdquo;. Deuteronomy 1:3# 2. Zechariah 1:7b which is the month Shebat, Shebat is the aquired Babylonian name for the eleventh month.# a. This is the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel.# 3. Zechariah 1:7c in the second year of Darius, this is Darius I who succeeded Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s son to the throne.# 4. Zechariah 1:7d the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah,the son of Iddo, this is three months after receiving the first message.# a. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight visions in one night.# b. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was later compiled together to form all of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecies.# 5. Zechariah 1:7-8a \u0026hellip;as follows: I saw at night, This was not a dream. He was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6# 6. Zechariah 1:8b and behold, a man was riding\u0026hellip;This man is one of the riders but appears to take a more prominent role. There were coloured horses behind him.# 7. Zechariah 1:8c on a red horse, generally speaking red symbolizes blood as a result of war. This rider may ready for battle. Twice Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. Revelation 6:4, Revelation 19:19-21# a. Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in context of war.# b. The color red could be in connection with blood and or war.# c. In Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.# 8. Zechariah 1:8d and he was standing among the myrtle trees It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees.# a. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther\u0026rsquo;s Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7# c. In the New Covenant promises to Israel, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19# i) The prophet Nehemiah mentions myrtle branches during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths.# 9. Zechariah 1:8e which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Red, sorrel and white horses behind him# 10. Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw.# 11. Zechariah 1:9b And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor\u0026rsquo;s task to guess what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1# 12. Zechariah 1:10a And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, Twice we are told he is a man. He enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision\u0026hellip;# 13. Zechariah 1:10b \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; These are most likely angelic beings sent by the Lord.# a. This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7# b. We know from Job 1:6-7 that Satan also roams to and fro over the earth.# 14. Zechariah 1:11a So they answered the angel of the LORD The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article the helps identify He is singular. What else can we see?# a. This “man among the myrtle trees” appears to be the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13). Scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead (preincarnate Christ), who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth.# b. The Angel of the Lord appeared to these and more:# i) to comfort Hagar. Genesis 16:7–14# ii) to stop Abraham. Genesis 18; 22:11–18# iii) to wrestle with Jacob. Genesis 31:11, 13# iv) to call Moses. Exodus 3# v) to talk sense into Balaam. Numbers 22# vi) to prepare Gideon for battle. Judges 6:11–23# vii) Six times in Zechariah. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8# c. The Angel of the Lord will one day destroy the nations to go against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8# 15. Zechariah 1:11b who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth,# 16. Zechariah 1:11c and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026ldquo;Peace! All is well!\u0026rdquo;.# a. Though Persia experienced political instability, by this time Darius had established a firm control over the empire and world dominance. The report of the horses was that all was peaceful and quiet.# 17. Zechariah 1:12a Then the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, The angel of the Lord is compelled to ask how long would the injustice to Israel continue.# a. Things with Israel were far from right in order to be at peace. They had taken advantage of Israel\u0026rsquo;s demise.# i) God had said their time of discipline was going to be 70 years. This is well over the 70 years and they still are barely existing.# ii) The Gentile nations were at peace at the expense of God\u0026rsquo;s nation Israel. God has no regard for man\u0026rsquo;s way of peace apart from Him.# iii) There is complete indifference on behalf of the nations towards their own sovereignty. nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to have their land.# c. True, world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne in Israel. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4# d. World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deaded to her and Babylon is destroyed. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5# c. God\u0026rsquo;s timing regarding world judgement is perfect. He is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9# 18. Zechariah 1:12b with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo;# a. God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, \u0026ldquo;how much longer are your people to suffer?\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 29:10.# b. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 16 extra years had passed and still \u0026ldquo;the earth is peaceful and quiet\u0026rdquo; and no temple has been erected. Jeremiah 29:10# c. The angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s words reflect his concern for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026ldquo;at peace\u0026rdquo;. It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Acts 1:7# 19. Zechariah 1:13 The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the \u0026ldquo;questioning\u0026rdquo; and responds with kind words. Colossians 4:6# 20. Zechariah 1:14a So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, This message is not to be kept hidden, it is to be announced.# a. As a prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2# i) This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12# 21. Zechariah 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous\u0026hellip; The Lord kindly responds \u0026ldquo;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!\u0026rdquo; God has a strong devotion towards his posession, Israel. Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7# a. This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel.# 22. Zechariah 1:14c for Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture we see how Zion is synonimous with Jerusalem, yet here they are shown distinct.# a. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6. Zion is the mountain on which God\u0026rsquo;s house, the temple, stands. Micah 3:12.# b. Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Micah 4:1, 3. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Micah 4:2# 23. Zechariah 1:15a \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; The nations were at ease, that is, there was general peace. Persia was the world power and experienced a time of peace.# a. The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not posess her land. They have done nothing to promote Israel\u0026rsquo;s reestablishment. On the contrary, they are totally at ease with the current situation.# 24. Zechariah 1:15b for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo;# a. Israel\u0026rsquo;s exile was unnecessary and a calamity but they response of the nations has only made it worse.# i) The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent peace and requests justice on behalf of Israel.# b. The Lord had warned the nations they (especially in the case the Chaldeans) would be punished for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34-35, Amos 6:1# 25. Zechariah 1:16a \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion;# 26. Zechariah 1:16b My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; the rebuilding of temple is foretold here.# 27. Zechariah 1:16c declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins.# a. We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort. About 200 years earlier, God had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this if they did not heed his voice.# b. Isaiah 44:28 It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; .# i) Zechariah adds to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zechariah 4:9-10# 28. Zechariah 1:17a \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Psalm 132:13# a. The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15# b. While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.# c.# d. When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zechariah 13:9# e. When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Ezekiel 36:11# f. When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Ezekiel 36:23# g. When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Ezekiel 36:36.# h. When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Ezekiel 36:38.# i. When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Ezekiel 37:6.# j. When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Ezekiel 37:13# k. When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Ezekiel 37:14# l. When God\u0026rsquo;s sanctuary will stand among them forever. Ezekiel 37:28# m. When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Ezekiel 38:23# n. When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Ezekiel 39:28# A. Zechariah 1:18-21 Vision of Four Horns \u0026amp; Four Craftsmen# 1. God\u0026rsquo;s protection of Israel from oppressing nations.# 2. Zechariah 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Zechariah became suddently of four horns.# a. Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. In verse 21 we see nations lifted up their horns against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17# 3. Zechariah 1:19a So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah did not readily understand what he saw. He asks the interpreting angel what they are.# 4. Zechariah 1:19b And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; Zechariah saw four horns and the angel explains that these represented nations that had scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem. We are not told which nations are these referring to.# a. Option 1 (past): The four horns had already come and gone. They are always stated as having come already. This could be referring to the four nations (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) that almost destroyed Judah during the time of Jehoiakim\u0026rsquo;s reign. 2 Kings 24:1-2# i) The four craftsmen could be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah;# ii) Assyria scattered Israel to the north, not Judah, Jeremiah 50:17-18# b. Option 2 (future): Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that oppress Israel. A few decades earlier, Daniel had prophecied of four horns. The first was Babylon, then Medo-Persia, Greece and finally Rome. This would align with the end \u0026ldquo;times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo;. Ezekiel 34:11-31# a. One difficulty is that Medo-Persia was instrumental in Judah returning to the land.# b. The second option seems the most probable although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s prophecy would probably associate these 4 horns with Daniel\u0026rsquo;s. The identity of the nations however is not given.# 5. Zechariah 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; A craftsman is a skillful artisan. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31# 6. Zechariah 1:21b And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; through oppression, sorrow, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15# a. This was their current condition but will be their ongoing condition as long as the \u0026ldquo;times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo; continues.# 7. Zechariah 1:21c but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;* Even though the horns had scattered Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would come to terrify them and throw them down.# a. We don\u0026rsquo;t know the identity of the four craftsmen. Some have said they are the very successors to the horns. For instance, the first crafsmen throwing down the first horn (Babylon) would be Medo-Persia. We cannot be certain of who these are.# b. This vision served to encourage Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who has a plan and the resources to bring about justice in the end.# A. Zechariah 1:7 Vision of Measuring Jerusalem# 1. Zechariah 2:1 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a man who had an instrument to measure in his hand.# 2. Zechariah 2:2a So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah was puzzled as to where the man was going. He asks the man directly. The question of where may be because the current city of Jerusalem and it\u0026rsquo;s borders were gone and was actually barren land since it had been demolished years before.# 3. Zechariah 2:2b And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to measure Jerusalem.# 4. Zechariah 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel.# 5. Zechariah 2:4a and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting angel to run!# a. Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement at the time! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.# 6. Zechariah 2:4b \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.# 7. Zechariah 2:5a \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for walls.# a. Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy attacks. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3# b. Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it\u0026rsquo;s even harder to see her not needing walls.# 8. Zechariah 2:5b and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem but because of God in her midst. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11,# 9. Zechariah 2:6 \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# a. This was directed to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not inviting to a speedy return to the land. This was true then and continues today.# 10. Zechariah 2:7 \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.# a. The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17 This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Revelation 17:5# 11. Zechariah 2:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10# 12. Zechariah 2:9a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately shatter them like earthenware and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2# a. In a show of power, God will make these nations (them) to serve Israel (their slaves). One day Israel will be the greatest nation on earth.# 13. Zechariah 2:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. A most important aspect of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled.# a. Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;you will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo; Exodus 6:7# b. The phrase \u0026ldquo;you will know\u0026rdquo; occurs 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know because He would be there.# i) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. Zechariah 2:9# ii) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Zechariah 2:11# iii) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Zechariah 4:9# iv) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Zechariah 6:15# c. Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no doubt it is the fulfillment.# 14. Zechariah 2:10a \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon. Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9# 15. Zechariah 2:10b for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# 16. Zechariah 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.# a. A reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel\u0026rsquo;s rule.# b. At least 20 references of the Day of the Lord are found in Zechariah.# i) When God returns and comforts Jerusalem. Zechariah 1:17# ii) When God defends the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:6# iii) When God will destroy the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:3, 9# iv) When God will remove all idolatry from the land. Zechariah 13:2# v) reign over all the earth from Zion. Zechariah 14:4, 9# vi) This must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst.# 17. Zechariah 2:11b Then I will dwell in your midst\u0026hellip; God promises that He will once again dwell with Israel.# a. This is what the tabernacle and temple symbolized. Exodus 25:8# 18. Zechariah 2:11c and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day dwell in their midst forever.# a. In the person of Christ, God will literally dwell among His people.# 19. Zechariah 2:12 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God\u0026rsquo;s people. They did not walk with God as a nation and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25# 20. Zechariah 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4# A. Zechariah 3:1-10 Vision of Joshua the high priest and associates and God\u0026rsquo;s associate, The Branch# 1. Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God\u0026rsquo;s servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35# 2. Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when \u0026ldquo;the Branch\u0026rdquo; rules# 3. Zechariah 3:1a Then he showed me Joshua the high priest# 4. Zechariah 3:1b standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.# 5. Zechariah 3:2a The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! This must be Jesus rebuking Satan Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem.# 4. Zechariah 3:2b Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;# 5. Zechariah 3:3a Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments# 6. Zechariah 3:3b-4a and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him,# 7. Zechariah 3:4b saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Joshua represents the current state of Israel.# 8. Zechariah 3:4c Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father\u0026rsquo;s doing, not the son\u0026rsquo;s.# 9. Zechariah 3:5a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps an obvious next step to Zechariah so he says, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t forget the turban!!\u0026rdquo;. Zechariah can\u0026rsquo;t contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on\u0026hellip;# 10. Zechariah 3:5b So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.# 11. Zechariah 3:6 And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,# 12. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,# 13. Zechariah 3:7 then you will also govern My house\u0026hellip; God gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Ezekiel 44:15-16 Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27# 14. Zechariah 3:7 and also have charge of My courts, The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests would be placed in charge of all the courts.# 15. Zechariah 3:7 and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest.# a. Notice must given to the words of the angel of the Lord here\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;IF you will walk\u0026hellip;then you will govern my house\u0026rdquo;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience.# 1) governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.# 2) In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5# 15. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.# 16. Zechariah 3:7 you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends symbolize all the priests# 17. Zechariah 3:7 for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13# 18. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. This addition is very interesting\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;before Joshua\u0026rdquo; the stone. The cornerstone. The seven eyes of the Lamb? Revelation 5:6# 19. Zechariah 3:7 Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.# 20. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor# 21. Zechariah 3:10 to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakuk 3:17# A. Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold# 1. Zechariah 1:7 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to so he was wide awake when receiving the vision.# 2. Zechariah 1:7 He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks# 3. Zechariah 1:7 and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Exodus 25:37# 4. Zechariah 1:7 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;# 5. Zechariah 1:7 Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# 6. Zechariah 1:7 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said,\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# 7. Zechariah 1:7 Then he said to me, particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained# 8. Zechariah 1:7 \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, a specific message to Zerubbabel\u0026hellip; who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12).# a. His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge. 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what God commanded. Ezra 5:2# 9. Zechariah 1:7 \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026ldquo;ease does not produce strength\u0026rdquo;. Grace is what teaches us (Titus 2:11-12 ).# a. The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they began rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14# b. All believers get their enabling strenghtening by grace (Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2)# 10. Zechariah 1:7 \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God\u0026rsquo;s instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable!# 11. Zechariah 1:7 and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God\u0026rsquo;s power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba.# a. God\u0026rsquo;s power, God\u0026rsquo;s spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth\u0026hellip;God did it!# 12. Zechariah 1:7 Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel# 13. Zechariah 1:7 have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through \u0026lsquo;his hands\u0026rsquo;. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God.# 14. Zechariah 1:7 *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things?# a. The second temple wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite as glorious as the first. The older generation that had seen Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple was a bit disappointed.# i) When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with raw materials. He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world.# 15. Zechariah 1:7 But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel— a plumb line is used for building. God would be pleased to see the reconstruction back in full swing.# 16. Zechariah 1:7 these are the eyes of the LORD the seven eyes Revelation 5:6# Zechariah 1:7 which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;# 17. will see and be glad\u0026hellip; The Lord is saying, don’t despise things that appear small! What matters is that the Lord did it not the size or number of it!# 17. Zechariah 1:7 Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo;# 18. Zechariah 1:7 And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,# 19. Zechariah 1:7 which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;# 20. Zechariah 1:7 So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# 21. Zechariah 1:7 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Revelation 11:4# A. Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll# 1. Zechariah 5:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, *# 2. Zechariah 5:2 \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; the scroll that Christ opens in Revelation 5?# 3. Zechariah 5:3a Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land;# 4. Zechariah 5:3b surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side,# 5. Zechariah 5:3c and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.# 6. Zechariah 5:4a \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts,# 7. Zechariah 5:4b \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name;# 8. Zechariah 5:4c and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;# A. Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket# 1. Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;# 2. Zechariah 5:6a I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo;# 3. Zechariah 5:6b-7 Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo;# 4. Zechariah 5:8 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo;# 5. Zechariah 5:8 And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.# 6. Zechariah 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings;# 7. Zechariah 5:9 and they had wings like the wings of a stork,# 8. Zechariah 5:9 and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.# 9. Zechariah 5:10 I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;# 10. Zechariah 5:11 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar;# 11. Zechariah 5:11 and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;# A. Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots# 1. Zechariah 6:1a Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth\u0026hellip;earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three horses. Now he sees four groups of horses pulling chariots.# a. Chariots were used in battle. Most likely that is the symbolism here. These chariots are going for judgment.# 2. Zechariah 6:1b from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. We\u0026rsquo;re not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. We\u0026rsquo;re not told if they have any significance, just that there are two bronze mountains.# 3. Zechariah 6:2-3 With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.# Again, the symbolism of the colors is not explained to us. There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does not mean identity.# 4. Zechariah 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wishes to know the identity of the horse pulled chariots.# 5. Zechariah 6:5 The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, we conclude these must be angelic envoys sent by the Lord of all the earth.# 6. Zechariah 6:6a with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them,# 7. Zechariah 6:6b-7a while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; Interestingly all the chariot teams seem eager. These seem to want to go patrol the earth.# 8. Zechariah 6:7b *And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth.# 9. Zechariah 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The black horses followed by the white horses brought judgment upon the land of the north and appeased God\u0026rsquo;s anger.# 10. We are not told here the identity or timeframe of these events. Some speculate that the land of the north refers to Babylon which was overthrown by the Cyrus, God\u0026rsquo;s anointed instrument.# A. Zechariah 6:9-15 A message of hope, a crown for a coming King# 10. Zechariah 6:9-10a The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah;# 11. Zechariah 6:10b and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.# 12. Zechariah 6:11 \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.# 13. Zechariah 6:12a \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch,# 14. Zechariah 6:12b for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD.# 15. Zechariah 6:13a \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor# 16. Zechariah 6:13b and sit and rule on His throne.# 17. Zechariah 6:13c Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;# 18. Zechariah 6:14 \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.# 19. Zechariah 6:15a \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo;# 20. Zechariah 6:15b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.# a. the fulfillment of the covenant promises are not whether they will happen or not. they will happen, however for it to happen they as a nation need to be in a right place with God. Not merely practicing the rituals but with a right heart before God. This is what will take place when Israel puts their faith in Yahweh, specifically Jesus, Yahweh.# IV. Zechariah 7-8 - Message #3 A brief look at the condition of the people contrasted by promises of the future# The next section of Zechariah comes 14 months later. The approximate date is December 4, 518b.C. This time Zechariah does not receive visions but rather in the form of a message from the Lord. rest of the book of Zechariah comes in the form of messages that Zechariah received.\nA. Zechariah 7:1-14 The town of Bethel sends a delegation to Jerusalem to seek the favour of the Lord# 1. Due to time that has passed, probably in response to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s call to return to the Lord. An inquiry is made to the priests regarding current and past practices. These chapters should be treated as a whole within the message of Zechariah. Haggai 2:12-16# 2. Zechariah 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.# 3. Zechariah 7:2 Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, we don\u0026rsquo;t see Regemmelech mentioned any other place. However there is a Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father Sennacherib and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38# a. Esarhaddon his son, began to reign in place of Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37# b. It is of some interest to note that Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, \u0026ldquo;Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.\u0026rdquo; Ezra 4:2,# c. Were these two men Regemmelech and Sharezer (Assyrian names?) trying to merely \u0026ldquo;appease\u0026rdquo; God?# Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king\u0026rsquo;s spokesman. Perhaps this man had some governmental authority.# d. Bethel has an interesting history of idolatry.# 4. Zechariah 7:3 speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; Since the destruction of the temple, people had started a fast as a lament of its loss.# a. The fast of the fifth month was remembering when the temple was burned. 2 Kings 25:8# 5. Zechariah 7:4-5 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years\u0026hellip;# a. the fast of the seventh month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to flee to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25# b. Fasts were also held in the fourth and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2# c. These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They had been self-imposed and held for about 70 years during the Babylonian captivity.# d. On the surface, the question being brought before the priests seems sincere. God\u0026rsquo;s answer through Zechariah will reveal to them a much deeper problem.# 5. Zechariah 7:5b was it actually for Me that you fasted? We are reminded of Jesus\u0026rsquo; conversation with Peter, \u0026ldquo;Do you love me more than these?\u0026rdquo;.# perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting.# God is not asking what they were doing or how they should do it but why they did it in the first place# the people religiously held a religious ceremony conmemorating their faith.# motivation for doing the fasting was not for God. Neither did God ever tell them it should be done.\nMan has not changed much. today during the church age much is not in the name of faith for God but has has not God as a mottive nor His ordination. this can be seen as religios rote but also in more modern churches where people seek to bring \u0026lsquo;social justice\u0026rsquo; remove poverty from the earth, give to multiple causes etc. just like the fasting in thise days was not for God, today\u0026rsquo;s multiple sanctimonius activities can be godless.\n6. Zechariah 7:6 \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?# 6. Zechariah 7:7 \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# 7. Zechariah 7:8-9 Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;# a. Zechariah 7:10a and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor;# b.

These verses prophetically explain Alexander the Great\u0026rsquo;s conquest from north to south beginning at Syria, Phoenicia and then Philistia after the battle of Issus in 333 b.C.# i) Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of Syria.# ii) Tyrus and SIdon are principal cities of Phoenicia# iii) Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of Philistia.# 2. Zechariah 9:7 The burden of the word of the LORD# 3. Zechariah 9:7 is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place\u0026hellip; uncertain. Hadrach (Chadrak) is a syrian deity.# a. Damascus means a well-watered land in Syriac.# 4. Zechariah 9:7 (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD).

Zechariah 9:7 But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; This was fulfilled when Alexander refrained from destroying Jerusalem.# a. According to the historian Josephus, Alexander came to Jerusalem and demanded payment of tribute which the Jews ordinarily paid to the Persians. The Jews refused. However that night, the high priest had a dream where God told him to go out to meet Alexander wearing his priestly garments of glory and beauty.# i) When Alexander saw the priests come out to meet him wearing their robes, he fell to his face and worshipped. When asked why, he stated he had seen the very same procession in a dream.# 16. Zechariah 9:8 And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Jeremiah 16:17,# 17.

Hebrews 9:12 and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.# c. Hebrews 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,# d. Hebrews 9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?# e. Hebrews 9:15 And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.# f. Hebrews 9:16 For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.# g. Hebrews 9:17 For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.# h. Hebrews 9:18 Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.# i. Hebrews 9:19 For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,# j. Hebrews 9:20 saying, \u0026ldquo;THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU.\u0026rdquo;# k. Hebrews 9:21 And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.# l. Hebrews 9:22 And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.# m. Hebrews 9:23 Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.# n. Hebrews 9:24 For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;# o. Hebrews 9:25 nor was it that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own.# p. Hebrews 9:26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.# 5.

This refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together, which for about 1000 years had been separated.# 9. Zechariah 1:7 And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece;# 10. Zechariah 1:7 And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them,# 11.

But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo;\n1. Zechariah 1:7 \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts.# 2. Zechariah 1:7 \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep.# a. Mark 14:27-28 *And Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;You will all fall away, because it is written, \u0026lsquo;I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.\u0026rdquo; Jesus quotes Zechariah where the Lord of Hosts declares he will Strike the Shepherd, then He continues what was written to say He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah in with the Gospel account.# b. Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound.# c. Isaiah 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.# i) Jesus was smitten of God. The next verse goes on to explain why\u0026hellip;# ii) Isaiah 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.# iii) The word scourging (singular) here is another word for blow or wound. The reason Christ was smitten was for our healing. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins.# d. Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do this. He would strike down the Shepherd, turn His hand against the little ones and raise the Shepherd back up. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.# The Gospel was God\u0026rsquo; eternal plan for the redemption of man.# \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish;# But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nZechariah 1:7 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD# when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.\nZechariah 1:7 Then the LORD will go forth# and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.\nZechariah 1:7 In that day# His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east;\nZechariah 1:7 and the Mount of Olives# will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.\nZechariah 1:7 Then the LORD, my God, will come,# and all the holy ones with Him!\nZechariah 1:7 In that day# there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.\nZechariah 1:7 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem,# half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth;\nZechariah 1:7 in that day# the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.\nZechariah 1:7 Now this will be the plague# with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.\nZechariah 1:7 It will come about in that day# that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.\nZechariah 1:7 So also like this plague# will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.\nZechariah 1:7 Then it will come about# that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.\nZechariah 1:7 And it will be that# whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.\nZechariah 1:7 In that day# there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nZechariah 1:7 And the cooking pots# in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts;\nZechariah 1:7 and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.# And there will no longer be a Canaanite# in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n"},{

      "content":"Zechariah# The Story of Israel\u0026rsquo;s Return# Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!\u0026hellip;For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15\nIn Ezekiel 23 God tells a story of two young sisters who He takes on as wives. The older sister, Oholah, desired what the Assyrians had to offer and she gave herself in harlotry to them. The younger sister, Oholibah was even worse and gave herself in like manner to the Babylonians. Both women committed abominable acts of harlotry. The two women are an allegory of Israel and Judah giving themselves in idolatry to the nations.\nThe book of Zechariah contains a powerful message to the reader. One\u0026rsquo;s view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does. It contains theologial teaching, spiritual uplifting and eschotological information that presents the Messiah in a unique way as the eternal\nZechariah is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out through and some details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.\nGod is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah.\nUnder the current circumstances it would appear as though God had forgotten Israel. Zechariah (Yahweh remembers) son of Berechiah (Yahweh blesses) and grandson of Iddo (appointed time). This offer is always before Israel yet they reject Him over and over. Eventually Israel will be brought through a great Tribulation and only then will the the prophecies of Zechariah be fully accomplished. It will be when God remembers Israel at His appointed time and where the blessings will never fade away again.\nTable of Contents I. Background The Background of Zechariah II.

Glossary of Terms Key Term: The Story of Israel\u0026rsquo;s Return I. The Background of Zechariah# A. Historical setting# 1. Along with Haggai and Malachi, Zechariah is a post-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C.# a. The Jews have returned back in the land for about 18 years after being exiled for 70 years in Babylon.# b. Medo-Persia has overthrown the Babylonians and under Cyrus the Persian the command was given for the Jews to be allowed to go back. Ezra 2# b. Zerubbabel has been placed in charge as governor and is given some finances for the rebuilding of the temple. Ezra 3:7-8# 2. Upon first arriving, the Jews immediately set to build an altar to renew the sacrifices. Following that, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple. Ezra 3:1-6# a. This caused a lot of interest on behalf of the Samaritans who wanted to help rebuild the temple. Their help was refused because though they feared God, they served other gods as well. Ezra 4:1-3, 2 Kings 17:33# b. When the Jews refused their help however, they proceeded to make all sorts of trouble, telling the persian king that they should be prohibited to rebuild. Ezra 4:4-24# c. Somehow, in the change of power, the command to go back and rebuild was lost and the current king, Darius I had to go back through years of records and verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12# 3. After about 16 years of waiting, with king Darius I finding Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s decree the rebuilding of the temple continues. Ezra 6:1-5# 4. Two months prior to the prophecy of Zechariah, God had told the Jews through the prophet Haggai to begin work again on the temple. The Jews are discouraged and have lost hope.# 5. The message of Zechariah is one that is intended to encourage Israel not only to return to the land and to rebuild the temple but more importantly, to a spiritual return to the Lord.# 6. Though the intent of Zechariah does not seem to give a historical narrative, a general sense seems to be the following\u0026hellip;# a. Chapters 1-8 deal Israel under Medo-Persian rule# b. Chapters 9-10 Israel governed by Greece# c. Chapter 11 Israel under Roman domination# d. Chapters 12 to 14 Israel\u0026rsquo;s last days of national history# B. General Information# STRUCTURING of the book of Zechariah Zechariah 1:1-6 The first Message: Return to the Lord and He will return to you Zechariah 1:7-6 The Second Message: Eight night visions - God is working all things for Israel\u0026rsquo;s return 1. The horseman - Taking the temperament of the nations 2. 4 horns - Oppressing powers kept at bay 3. Measuring Jerusalem - The city rebuilt and protected 4. Joshua - A sinless Priest who removes all sin. 5. Zerubbabel - A King that gives light 6. Flying Scroll - Israel\u0026rsquo;s trouble, judgment on the nations 7. Woman in a Basket - wickedness removed from the land 8. 4 Chariots - Preparing for the kingdom A crown fit for The King Zechariah 7-8 The Third Message: A misplaced \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo; to the Lord A. A delegation seek the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour B. Counsel #1 - C. Counsel #2 - C. Counsel #3 - B. Counsel #4 - The Lord will replace their mourning for His joy A. The nations will seek the favor of the Lord Zechariah 9-14 The Fourth Message 1. The Lord comes to His people. He is rejected 2. The people return to God, He returns to them Key Term: The Story of Israel\u0026rsquo;s Return C. Why study the book of Zechariah?# 1. The book of Zechariah is written directly to the Jews who were returning back to the land from the 70 year exile in Babylon.# a. It is a message of encouragement, of hope and and restoration.# b. It is because of the prophecies of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the temple continued and after 4 years was completed. Ezra 6:14# 2. We would do well to learn from this book. The New Testament quotes or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.# a. Not only does it unfold details of prophecy, it reveals behind-the-scenes spiritual warfare# b. It shows how God is in control and never forgets his promises# c. Most importantly, it reveals to us the person of Christ (Revelation 19:10).# d. It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father prior to his first coming.# e. It shows us his nature during his first coming and finally his galant entry and conquest on his second return as conquering king.# f. It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological unfolding of the future but rather to present to us the very purpose of prophecy - the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God\u0026rsquo;s plan of restoration.# g. Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s immediate audience as well as the generations to follow, including the church age, would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He chose to make unconditional promises to Abraham and He will keep his word. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally. Genesis 12:1-3,# 3. Zechariah is a book that is seldom taught as it undoubtedly presents the interpreter with many challenges.# a. While Zechariah presents many future events and gives details regarding those events, the key to understanding Zechariah is not to reveal future historical narrative. Instead all the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah, Christ the Lord.# II. Zechariah 1:1-6 - The First Message - Introduction, God\u0026rsquo;s call to return# A. Zechariah 1:1-2 Date and Author# 1. Zechariah 1:1a In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,… Cyrus was the Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the writing of Zechariah in 520 B.C..# a. The dating is not according to a Jewish leader as is seen in many Old Testament books. No Jewish king is reigning and Jerusalem is being trampled underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24# 1) Perhaps many in Israel thought Messiah would come at this time since the 70 years of Jeremiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy were complete and there was a wave of people gathering back to the land. Daniel 9:1-19# i) Cyrus was mistakenly called Messiah by the people because he let them return to the land. However, it was God using Cyrus (an unbeliever) as His instrument to return the people back to their land. Isaiah 45:1-5# 2. Zechariah 1:1b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,… Zechariah was a levite, born in Babylon (Nehemiah 12:1, 16). Zechariah means Yahweh remembers.# a. Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah is both priest (Nehemiah 12:16) and prophet. Ezra 5:1, 6:14# b. Zechariah is probably a young man. Zechariah 2:4# 2) Haggai prophesied in September, October and December. However, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s first prophecy was in November. Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy complemented the message given by an older prophet.# c. Some scholars ascribe Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah.# 3. Zechariah 1:1c the son of Berechiah,… Berechiah was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra. Not much else is known about Berechiah except that his name means Yahweh blesses.# a. Curiously, Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called Zechariah son of Berechiah in Matthew 23:35.# 1) Option 1: A case of mixed identity. There was another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was killed by the people (2 Chronicles 24:20-22). Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. This theory claims since they mean the same, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus.# 2) Option 2: Same ancestors. Both Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s may have had fathers named Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually somewhere in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s geneology.# 3) Option 3: Copying error. An copyists\u0026rsquo;s error in transcription of the Greek text.# 4) Option 4: Only God witnessed it. Though no one else saw, Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder, just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s. This seems the most plausible option of the 4.# i) The Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also states that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. The rabbis would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus.# ii) Matthew seems familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus mention it this way.# iii) God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He sees all that is done in public as well as in secret. Ultimately he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20# 4. Zechariah 1:1d the son of Iddo… Iddo is Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. His name means the appointed time.# a. Iddo was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 12:4, 12:16# b. Zechariah is also referred to as the son of Iddo. This is common practice in the Old Testament to say his forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14# Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah is also a prophet and priest.# 5. Together, the names of Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time\u0026rdquo;. When the set time comes, God will fulfill all His promises and they will be carried out with overflowing blessing.# B. Zechariah 1:2-3 Thesis of the book, \u0026ldquo;return to Me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo;# 1. Zechariah 1:2 \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers.… the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36# 2. Zechariah 1:3a \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them,… Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s primary audience are the people who have returned from exile in Babylon.# 3. Zechariah 1:3b Thus says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo; word to the people.# a. this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua.# b. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God\u0026rsquo;s word. Hebrews 1:1, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:20-21# c. When God speaks something, He is tied to His Word to fulfill it. Ezra 1:1, Proverbs 30:5, Hebrews 6:17-18,# 4. THE LORD OF HOSTS (Yahweh Saboath):# a. The Lord of Hosts is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. In order to properly understand the book of Zechariah we must get better acquainted with this name.# b. THE LORD OF HOST IS COMMANDER OF ARMIES# 1) (Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of armies used 235 times in the Bible).# i) Tza-va (צבא ) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the plural, referring to multiple armies of which include angelic beings.# 2) Isaiah 13:4 \u0026hellip;The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3# 3) 1 Kings 22:19 \u0026hellip;I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many.# 4) Isaiah 19:16 \u0026hellip;they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip;Awake to punish all the nations\u0026hellip; Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7# 5) Nahum 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am against you,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.\u0026rdquo; Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matthew 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20# 6) Luke 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying\u0026hellip; Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53# 7. Isaiah 37:35-36 \u0026lsquo;For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David\u0026rsquo;s sake.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead.# c. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS KING:# 1) Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19# 2) Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# 3) Isaiah 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14# d. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE REDEEMER:# 1) Isaiah 47:4 Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel.# 2) Isaiah 44:6 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: \u0026lsquo;I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me. Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5# 3) Psalm 84:1-12 \u0026hellip;.How blessed is the man who trusts in You!# e. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HOLY:# 1) Isaiah 6:3 \u0026ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16# f. The LORD OF HOSTS is ALMIGHTY:# 1) \u0026ldquo;All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN \u0026amp; among the inhabitants of earth \u0026amp; no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, \u0026lsquo;What have You done?\u0026rdquo; Daniel 4:35# 2) Hannah is the first person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. 1 Samuel 1# 3) David invokes the Lord of Hosts when going to battle with Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10# i) Though David didn\u0026rsquo;t use Saul\u0026rsquo;s armor, he put on the Lord of Hosts.# ii) David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27# A Mighty Fortress is our God# A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;\nOur helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:\nFor still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;\nHis craft and pow\u0026rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate,\nOn earth is not his equal.\n\u0026ndash;\nDid we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;\nWere not the right Man on our side, the Man of God\u0026rsquo;s own choosing.\nDost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;\nLord Sabaoth is his name, from age to age the same,\nAnd He must win the battle.\n\u0026ndash;\nAnd though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,\nWe will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us;\nThe Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;\nHis rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,\nOne little word shall fell him.\n\u0026ndash;\nThat word above all earthly pow\u0026rsquo;rs, no thanks to them, abideth;\nThe Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth;\nLet goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;\nThe body they may kill: God\u0026rsquo;s truth abideth still,\nHis kingdom is forever. - Martin Luther\ng. The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in understanding that it is the Lord of Hosts who is actively involved with the protection, provision and ultimate destiny of Israel. He is the Almighty, great Commander, the One who has all resources at his disposal and battles in favour of his people.# 1) Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message comes directly from the Lord of hosts himself\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;thus says the Lord of hosts\u0026rdquo; This is crucial to see to properly understand the message.# 2) It is the Lord of Hosts who will ultimately not allow injustice to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8# 3) When Christ is seated on His throne, His name will be called the Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16-17# 5. Zechariah 1:3c \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026quot;… While Haggai is more focused on the return to the land and the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message is to encourage the people to return in a right relationship with God.# a. The Jews needed to place their focus and trust in the giver and purpose of the temple, not the temple itself. 1 John 3:3# Zephaniah 3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!# Zephaniah 3:2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.# c. The opposite of return is to forsake. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and turned to trust in other things.# 6. Zechariah 1:3d declares the LORD of hosts,… The Lord of hosts commands Israel to return, not merely to the land, the law and all the ordinances, but to Himself.# a. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are coming back in the land, they have already rebuilt the altar and restored the daily sacrifices. The foundation for the temple is laid. Thing seemily are going well, apart from a little annoyance from the Samaritans, God is blessing the nation.# b. Haggai\u0026rsquo;s prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and especially the temple. Yet in Zechariah, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, the jews must first of all return to Him spiritually. This, perhaps was overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances.# c. So, when trials comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11# 7. Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God\u0026rsquo;s presence among the people.# a. The Lord of hosts is inviting Israel to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart with himself.# C. Zechariah 1:4-6 An Illustration showing the antithesis of returning to the Lord# 1. In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will say to the Jews what \u0026ldquo;return to me\u0026rdquo; is not.# 2. Zechariah 1:4a \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers,… Remember you fathers bad example? 2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8# a. In other words God says, when I say \u0026ldquo;return to me\u0026rdquo; it is the opposite to what your fathers had done, don\u0026rsquo;t be like that!.# 3. Zechariah 1:4b to whom the former prophets proclaimed,… namely; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10# 3. Zechariah 1:4c *saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;…*Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10# at this point many are prone to say, if Israel would have ceased from sinning, God would have returned. That is not what this is saying. A return to God is not synonymous with being sinless. A return to God is by faith in God who accepts us on the basis of The Sinless One who paid for our sins. There is no other means to turn to God.# In chapter 3 we see a delightful scene when the Joshua de high priest is given new clothes after having soiled his. Yet it is God who changes his clothes standing in his presence.# Evil ways, and evil deeds here refers to their trusting in idols, forsaking the Lord, depending on other things rather than to God.# 5. Zechariah 1:4d But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.… They weren\u0026rsquo;t deaf or somehow unaware of God speaking time and time again through the prophets. They were rebellious and refused to listen. Jeremiah 44:16# a. Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place. A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil things but a return to fellowship.# 1) A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external).# b. God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27, Colossians 2:23# c. God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4# 1) It is counted as violence to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4# 2) In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. Jeremiah 10:2, Acts 28:3-4, Acts 17:23# d. This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. The arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be rebuilt. Haggai 1:2# 1) Once again, God disciplined them with a drought and still they did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17# 6. Zechariah 1:5a \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they?… The fathers had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10# 7. Zechariah 1:5b And the prophets, do they live forever?… Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to.# a. God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvatión is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2# 8. Zechariah 1:6a \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,…# 9. Zechariah 1:6b overtake your fathers?… Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still sends more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God\u0026rsquo;s commands are still the same, even today# 10. Zechariah 1:6c Then they repented and said,… the word for repent (SHUB) could be better translated here \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; as it\u0026rsquo;s referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. Compare the use of SHUB in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6# 11. Zechariah 1:6d As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.…# a. 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers . This including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2, Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70# b. Though many returned physically, their focus was on the land and the temple and on the blessings, not on the giver of those blessings. \u0026ldquo;Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, \u0026lsquo;This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; Jeremiah 7:4, 8# 12. A NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel.# a. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe based his translation on Jersome\u0026rsquo;s Latin Bible as his sole source. The Latin vulgate Bible unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one\u0026rsquo;s thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent.# 1) This doctrine was what was being taught by the Roman Church, which required doing penance to be forgiven.# 2. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel profound sorrow, be penitent) replaced the original Greek word metanoia (change your mind).# b. We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, \u0026lsquo;return\u0026rsquo;. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not.# c. They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them. This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized.# 1) That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for all sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God.# 2) Israel needed approach God by faith. To merely admit sinning and accepting the consequences from God is not the same as approaching God by faith. One must trust in God\u0026rsquo;s provision for sin.# d. The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of thinking, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said. Ezekiel 20:43# 1) It\u0026rsquo;s not merely recognizing the wrong you have done. It\u0026rsquo;s not merely admiting you\u0026rsquo;re guilty, it\u0026rsquo;s trusting God for the solution. Matthew 27:3-5# 2) It\u0026rsquo;s not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words.# 3) It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow leads to repentance but they are not one in the same thing, one leads to the other. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9# 4) It\u0026rsquo;s not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.# 5) It\u0026rsquo;s not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance. This is a common misconception that still plagues Christianity today. The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not are not a requirement by God for the internal to be authentic. Luke 3:8-18,# 6) Salvation is by faith in the Gospel. Salvation is not by works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9# 6) Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God, you change your thinking from what you are trusting in to trust God. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1# 7) For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5# 8) Or for a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16# 9) The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him.# 10) Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, \u0026ldquo;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote,*# Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.\u0026rdquo;# Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, \u0026ldquo;Who sees us?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Who knows us?\u0026rdquo; You turn things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, \u0026ldquo;He did not make me\u0026rdquo;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, \u0026ldquo;He has no understanding\u0026rdquo;?# 11) God wanted this Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith.# 12) \u0026ldquo;Return to me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo; - God# 13) “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”. James 4:8 NKJV# III. Zechariah 1:1-6 - The Second Message: Eight visions - God works all things for Israel\u0026rsquo;s return# A. Zechariah received 8 visions in one night. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some parts were fulfilled within the near future but most of the prophecies contained in the visions have yet to be fulfilled even today.# B. These night visions serve the primary purpose of revealing to the people, God\u0026rsquo;s involvement behind the scenes to make Israel and Judah\u0026rsquo;s return to Him a reality.# C. These visions serve to encourage the people of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time to finish building the temple. The temple is important for so many reasons within the existence of the Jews but a key reason is so that prophecy regarding Messiah might be fulfilled.# D. They also serve to give hope to future generations as the visions unveil how God is compassionately and faithfully fighting for Israel and of His plans to make Israel the epicenter of the world.# E. We will try not to discifer every detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know.# 1. Each of the visions follow a similar pattern.# a. Zechariah says what he saw# b. Zechariah asks what it means# c. Zechariah is told the significance# Passage Vision Meaning 1 Zechariah 1:7-17 The Horseman God is jealous for Israel. God is prepared to fight the nations for Israel\u0026rsquo;s restoration and bring justice and through it, world peace. 2 Zechariah 1:18-21 4 Horns and 4 craftsmen The nations who have scattered Israel will be thrown down. 3 Zechariah 2:1-13 Measuring Jerusalem Jerusalem will be restored 4 Zechariah 3:1-10 Joshua High Priest Though Israel (particularly the priesthood) has not walked as they should, God will one day restore Israel. 5 Zechariah 4:1-14 The Lampstand God empowers his people through His Spirit. 6 The Flying Scroll Righteous judgement; first on God\u0026rsquo;s peo Zechariah 5:1-4ple, then on the nations of the world. 7 Zechariah 5:5-11 The Ephah Wickedness of Shinar is restrained. 8 Zechariah 6:1-15 Four Chariots God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom is established with Messiah as King of the earth. A Crown fit for The King A. Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the Horsemen# 1. Zechariah 1:7a On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, in the Bible there are no Hebrew names given for months. The names we have were acquired from the Babylonians.# a. Moses gave the law to the second generation on the \u0026ldquo;11th month\u0026rdquo;. Deuteronomy 1:3# 2. Zechariah 1:7b which is the month Shebat, Shebat is the aquired Babylonian name for the eleventh month.# a. This is the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel.# 3. Zechariah 1:7c in the second year of Darius, this is Darius I who succeeded Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s son to the throne.# 4. Zechariah 1:7d the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah,the son of Iddo, this is three months after receiving the first message.# a. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight visions in one night.# b. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was later compiled together to form all of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecies.# 5. Zechariah 1:7-8a \u0026hellip;as follows: I saw at night, This was not a dream. He was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6# 6. Zechariah 1:8b and behold, a man was riding\u0026hellip;This man is one of the riders but appears to take a more prominent role. There were other coloured horses behind him. Twice Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. Revelation 6:4, Revelation 19:11-16, 19-21# The humanity of Messiah# Genesis 3:15 - A male seed of the woman# John 1:14 - The eternal God put on humanity. Revelation 22:13, 16# 7. Zechariah 1:8c \u0026hellip;on a red horse, we cannot be dogmatic but generally speaking red seems to symbolize blood as a result of war.# a. Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in context of war.# b. The color red could be in connection with blood and or war.# c. In Revelation 6:4 we see a red horse coming to take peace and cause war and bloodshed.# 8. Zechariah 1:8d and he was standing among the myrtle trees It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees.# a. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther\u0026rsquo;s Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7# c. In the New Covenant promises to Israel, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19# i) Myrtle branches are used during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths.# 9. Zechariah 1:8e which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Red, sorrel and white horses behind him# 10. Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw.# 11. Zechariah 1:9b And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor\u0026rsquo;s task to guess what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1# 12. Zechariah 1:10a And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, Twice we are told this rider is a man. He enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision\u0026hellip;# 13. Zechariah 1:10b \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; The horses here most likely represent angelic beings sent by the Lord.# a. This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7# b. We know from Job 1:6-7 that angelic beings are roaming the earth.# 14. Zechariah 1:11a So they answered the angel of the LORD This is the first mention of \u0026ldquo;the angel of the Lord\u0026rdquo; in Zechariah.# The ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article the helps identify He is singular. Scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead (the preincarnate Christ), who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth.# a. This “man among the myrtle trees” appears to be the same as the angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13).# b. The Angel of the Lord appeared other times:# i) to comfort Hagar. Genesis 16:7–14# ii) to stop Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. Genesis 18; 22:11–18# iii) to wrestle with Jacob. Genesis 31:11, 13# iv) to call Moses. Exodus 3# v) to talk sense into Balaam. Numbers 22# vi) to prepare Gideon for battle. Judges 6:11–23# vii) And six times in Zechariah. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8# c. The Angel of the Lord will one day destroy the nations that go up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8# 15. Zechariah 1:11b They answered the man \u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, These horses went to gather intel regarding the current political climate of the earth.# The book of Zechariah presents Christ as:# 1) The Angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:11# 2) The man. Zechariah 1:10, 1:11, 13:7# 3) The Branch. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12# 4) God\u0026rsquo;s Associate. Zechariah 13:7# 5) The Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7# 6) Priest. Zechariah 6:13# 7) The King. Zechariah 9:9, 14:16# 8) The Redeemer. Zechariah# 9) God\u0026rsquo;s Servant. Zechariah 3:8# 10) The Stone. Zechariah 3:7# 11) Lord of the whole earth. Zechariah 4:14, Revelation 11:4# 12) The Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16# 16. Zechariah 1:11c and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026ldquo;Peace at last, All is well!\u0026rdquo;.# a. Though Persia experienced a lot of political instability after the death of Cyrus, at this time Darius had established a firm control over the empire and world dominance. The report of the horses at the time of their patrol was that all was peaceful and quiet.# 17. Zechariah 1:12a Then the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, The angel of the Lord is compelled to ask how long would the injustice to Israel continue. The question and answer are so that the reader might know how much longer things will remain like they are.# We are reminded of Habakuk\u0026rsquo;s cry to the Lord, \u0026ldquo;How long, Lord, have I called for help, And You do not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save.\u0026rdquo; These words were uttered before Judah was taken into exile.# a. 70 years later, things with Israel were far from right in order to be at peace. The nations had taken advantage of Israel\u0026rsquo;s demise.# i) God had said their time of discipline was going to be 70 years. This is well over the 70 years and they still being oppressed.# ii) The Gentile nations were at peace at the expense of God\u0026rsquo;s nation Israel. God has no regard for man\u0026rsquo;s way of peace apart from Him.# iii) There is complete indifference on behalf of the nations towards Israel\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty. nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to have their land. Even today, Israel is treated with contempt.# c. True, world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne in Jerusalem. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4# d. World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deaded her and Babylon is utterly destroyed. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5# c. God\u0026rsquo;s timing regarding world judgement is perfect. He is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9# 18. Zechariah 1:12b with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; This rider seems disposed for battle, especially after hearing the report from the patrol.# a. God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, \u0026ldquo;how much longer are your people to suffer?\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 29:10.# b. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 16 extra years had passed and still \u0026ldquo;the earth is peaceful and quiet\u0026rdquo; and no temple has been erected. Jeremiah 29:10# c. The angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s words reflect his compassion for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026ldquo;at peace\u0026rdquo;. It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Acts 1:7# 19. Zechariah 1:13 The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the \u0026ldquo;questioning\u0026rdquo; and responds with kind words. Colossians 4:6# Psalm 94:19 When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations delight my soul.# Isaias 35:4 Say to those with anxious heart, \u0026ldquo;Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you.\u0026rdquo;# 20. Zechariah 1:14a So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, This message was not to be kept hidden, it was to be proclaimed to the people.# a. As a prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2# i) This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12# 21. Zechariah 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous\u0026hellip; The Lord kindly responds \u0026ldquo;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!\u0026rdquo; God has a strong devotion towards his posession, Israel. Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7# a. His disposition goes beyond what we hear when it is said, \u0026ldquo;God has a plan for you, he wants to bless you\u0026rdquo;. We must realize that God is seeking jealously his posession unto himself to not share with anyone or anything else. God is willing to go to great lengths because of this, even to war against the nations because he desires a people unto himself.# b. This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel.# 22. Zechariah 1:14c for Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture we see Zion used synonimously with Jerusalem. Here Zion should be understood as even more specific.# The earth is at the center of creation. Israel is the central nation of the world. Jerusalem is the central city in Israel. Zion is the mountain in Jerusalem where the temple will be built. Micah 3:12# a. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6# b. The term, Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Micah 4:1# c. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Micah 4:2# 23. Zechariah 1:15a \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; The nations were at ease with the current circumstances of Israel.# a. The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not posess her land. They have done nothing to promote Israel\u0026rsquo;s reestablishment.# 24. Zechariah 1:15b for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo;# a. Israel\u0026rsquo;s exile a disaster because it was unnecessary. Yet the response of the nations made the calamity even worse.# i) The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent peace and requests to know how much longer the status quo would be permitted to go on.# b. The Lord had warned the nations (especially in the case the Chaldeans) they would be judged for the way they treated of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34-35, Amos 6:1# 25. Zechariah 1:16a \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion;# 26. Zechariah 1:16b My house will be built in it\u0026hellip; the rebuilding of the temple is foretold here. The fulfillment of the temple is near and far.# Temples in the Bible# Temple Timeframe 1 1st - Solomon\u0026rsquo;s 958b.C. - 586b.C. 2 2nd - Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s 515b.C.-70a.D. 3 Mount Gerizim (Samaritans) 450b.C.-110b.C. 4 3rd - Tribulation temple ? - after midpoint of tribulation? 5 4th - The Branch\u0026rsquo;s Millenium - New Jerusalem House or temple (BAYITH) appears 31 times in Zechariah.# It can refer to a physical building. God\u0026rsquo;s Temple (Zechariah 1:16, 3:7, 4:9, 7:3, 8:9, 11:13, 14:20, 14:21), Temple in Shinar (Zechariah 5:11), Dwelling of any person (Zechariah 6:10, 14:2).# The house of \u0026ldquo;my friends\u0026rdquo; (Zechariah 13:6, possibly 5:4) this could be referring to Israel including the false religious leaders.# It can refer to a family or people. For instance, the house of Judah or the house of Israel (Zechariah 8:13, 8:15, 8:19, 10:3, 10:6, 12:4, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:12, 12:13, 13:1, )# It can refer to a religious system (Zechariah 7:3)# 27. Zechariah 1:16c declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins.# a. We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort and encourage the people. About 200 years earlier, God had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would send them into captivity if they did not heed his voice.# b. Isaiah 44:28 It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; .# i) Zechariah adds to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zechariah 4:9-10# 28. Zechariah 1:17a \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Psalm 132:13# a. The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15# b. While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.# c. When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zechariah 13:9# d. When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Ezekiel 36:11# e. When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Ezekiel 36:23# f. When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Ezekiel 36:36.# g. When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Ezekiel 36:38.# h. When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Ezekiel 37:6.# j. When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Ezekiel 37:13# k. When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Ezekiel 37:14# l. When God\u0026rsquo;s sanctuary will stand among them forever. Ezekiel 37:28# m. When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Ezekiel 38:23# n. When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Ezekiel 39:28# B. Zechariah 1:18-21 Vision of Four Horns \u0026amp; Four Craftsmen# 1. God\u0026rsquo;s protection of Israel from oppressing nations.# 2. Zechariah 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Zechariah became suddently of four horns.# a. Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. In verse 21 we see nations lifted up their horns against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17# 3. Zechariah 1:19a So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah did not readily understand what he saw. He asks the interpreting angel what they are.# 4. Zechariah 1:19b And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; Zechariah saw four horns and the angel explains that these represented nations that had scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem. We are not told which nations are these referring to.# a. Option 1 (past): The four horns had already come and gone. They are always stated as having come already. This could be referring to the four nations (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) that almost destroyed Judah during the time of Jehoiakim\u0026rsquo;s reign. 2 Kings 24:1-2# i) The four craftsmen could be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah;# ii) Assyria scattered Israel to the north, not Judah, Jeremiah 50:17-18# b. Option 2 (future): Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that oppress Israel. A few decades earlier, Daniel had prophecied of four horns. The first was Babylon, then Medo-Persia, Greece and finally Rome. This would align with the end \u0026ldquo;times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo;. Ezekiel 34:11-31# a. One difficulty is that Medo-Persia was instrumental in Judah returning to the land.# b. The second option seems the most probable although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s prophecy would probably associate these 4 horns with Daniel\u0026rsquo;s. The identity of the nations however is not given.# 5. Zechariah 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; A craftsman is a skillful artisan. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31# 6. Zechariah 1:21b And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; through oppression, sorrow, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15# a. This was their current condition but will be their ongoing condition as long as the \u0026ldquo;times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo; continues.# 7. Zechariah 1:21c but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;* Even though the horns had scattered Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would come to terrify them and throw them down.# a. We don\u0026rsquo;t know the identity of the four craftsmen. Some have said they are the very successors to the horns. For instance, the first crafsmen throwing down the first horn (Babylon) would be Medo-Persia. We cannot be certain of who these are.# b. This vision served to encourage Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who has a plan and the resources to bring about justice in the end.# C. Zechariah 1:7 Vision of Measuring Jerusalem# 1. Zechariah 2:1 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a man who had an instrument to measure in his hand.# 2. Zechariah 2:2a So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah was puzzled as to where the man was going. He asks the man directly. The question of where may be because the current city of Jerusalem and it\u0026rsquo;s borders were gone and was actually barren land since it had been demolished years before.# 3. Zechariah 2:2b And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to measure Jerusalem.# 4. Zechariah 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel.# 5. Zechariah 2:4a and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting angel to run!# a. Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement at the time! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.# 6. Zechariah 2:4b \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.# 7. Zechariah 2:5a \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for walls.# a. Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy attacks. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3# b. Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it\u0026rsquo;s even harder to see her not needing walls.# 8. Zechariah 2:5b and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem but because of God in her midst. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11,# 9. Zechariah 2:6 \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# a. This was directed to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not inviting to a speedy return to the land. This was true then and continues today.# 10. Zechariah 2:7 \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.# a. The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17 This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Revelation 17:5# 11. Zechariah 2:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10# 12. Zechariah 2:9a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately shatter them like earthenware and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2# a. In a show of power, God will make these nations (them) to serve Israel (their slaves). One day Israel will be the greatest nation on earth.# 13. Zechariah 2:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. A most important aspect of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled.# a. Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;you will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo; Exodus 6:7# b. The phrase \u0026ldquo;you will know\u0026rdquo; occurs 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know because He would be there.# i) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. Zechariah 2:9# ii) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Zechariah 2:11# iii) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Zechariah 4:9# iv) \u0026hellip;that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Zechariah 6:15# c. Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no doubt it is the fulfillment.# 14. Zechariah 2:10a \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon. Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9# 15. Zechariah 2:10b for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# 16. Zechariah 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.# a. This is a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel\u0026rsquo;s rule.# b. At least 20 references of the Day of the Lord are found in Zechariah. 17 of those times are in chapters 12-14.# Zechariah 2:11 \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 3:10 \u0026hellip;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 9:16 \u0026hellip;God will save them in that day As the flock of His people\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 12:3 \u0026hellip;I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 12:4 \u0026hellip;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 12:6 \u0026hellip;I will make the clans of Judah\u0026hellip;they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 12:8 \u0026hellip;the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 12:9 \u0026hellip;I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:11 \u0026hellip;there will be great mourning in Jerusalem\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 13:1 \u0026hellip;a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.# Zechariah 13:2 \u0026hellip;I will cut off the names of the idols from the land\u0026hellip;I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 13:4 \u0026hellip;the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 14:4 ...His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 14:6 \u0026hellip;there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.# Zechariah 14:8 \u0026hellip;living waters will flow out of Jerusalem\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 14:9 \u0026hellip;the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.# Zechariah 14:13 \u0026hellip;a great panic from the LORD will fall on them\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 14:20 \u0026hellip;there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 14:21 \u0026hellip;there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.# vi) We conclude then that the Day of the Lord must then be referring to a future period of time when God begins working with Israel as a nation and ends with its ultimate restoration.# 17. Zechariah 2:11b Then I will dwell in your midst\u0026hellip; God promises that He will once again dwell with Israel.# a. This is what the tabernacle and temple symbolized. Exodus 25:8# 18. Zechariah 2:11c and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day dwell in their midst forever.# a. In the person of Christ, God will literally dwell among His people.# 19. Zechariah 2:12 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God\u0026rsquo;s people. They did not walk with God as a nation and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25# 20. Zechariah 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4# D. Zechariah 3:1-10 Vision of Joshua the high priest and associates and God\u0026rsquo;s associate, The Branch# 1. Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God\u0026rsquo;s servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matthew 23:35# 2. Ultimately though, they will have their filthy clothes removed and given new.# 3. Zechariah 3:1a Then he showed me Joshua the high priest# 4. Zechariah 3:1b standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.# 5. Zechariah 3:2a The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! This must be Jesus rebuking Satan Indeed,# 6. Zechariah 3:2b the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem.# 4. Zechariah 3:2c Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;# 5. Zechariah 3:3a Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments This was Joshua\u0026rsquo;s condition representing the priesthood and all of Israel. There was not need for Satan to try to find something, the situation was obvious. The stench of the soiled garments alone gives him away.# 6. Zechariah 3:3b-4a and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him,# 7. Zechariah 3:4b saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Joshua represents the current state of Israel.# 8. Zechariah 3:4c Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; What a delightful scene to see the filthy clothes taken and festal robes put on!# Zechariah can\u0026rsquo;t contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on and exclaims\u0026hellip;# 9. Zechariah 3:5a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps an obvious next step to Zechariah as the priestly garments included a turban so he says, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t forget the turban!!\u0026rdquo;.# 10. Zechariah 3:5b So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.# This is so essential to the message of grace then and now.# It was God who removed unrighteousness.# It was God who made the sacrifice for sin.# It was God who clothed us with His righteousness.# 11. Zechariah 3:6 And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,# 12. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,# having been cleansed, having had their sins taken away by the Lord, now Joshua is told to walk in God\u0026rsquo;s ways and in His service.# Unfortunately, we so often hear that cleansing only comes if we remove our sin or if we try hard enough not to sin.# Here Joshua is being charged to walk with God in fellowship for ministerial service to take place.# 13. Zechariah 3:7 then you will also govern My house\u0026hellip; The Lord of Hosts gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Ezekiel 44:15-16# Interestingly, when Jesus will come, he will confront the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their failure to keep the first clause, \u0026ldquo;if you will walk in my ways\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. Matthew 21:23-27# 14. Zechariah 3:7 and also have charge of My courts\u0026hellip; the courts must refer to that which took place in the event of quarrels. The religious leaders were to act as judges and deal with fairness and justice.# 15. Zechariah 3:7 and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest.# a. Notice must given to the words of the angel of the Lord here\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;IF you will walk\u0026hellip;then you will\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience.# 1) governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways.# 2) In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5# 15. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.# 16. Zechariah 3:7 you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends here symbolizes the priesthood.# 17. Zechariah 3:7 for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13# 18. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. This addition is very interesting\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;before Joshua\u0026rdquo; the stone. The cornerstone. These may be the same seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.# 19. Zechariah 3:7 Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.# 20. Zechariah 3:7 \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor# 21. Zechariah 3:10 to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is a picture of peace and blessing in the kingdom age due to their iniquity being absolved.# Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakuk 3:17# E. Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold# 1. Zechariah 4:1 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. The word then shows this vision came afterward. Since the vision was at night, the interpreting angel roused Zechariah so he was wide awake when receiving the vision.# 2. Zechariah 4:2a He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks\u0026hellip;# 3. Zechariah 4:2b and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Exodus 25:37# 4. Zechariah 4:3 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;# 5. Zechariah 4:4 Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# 6. Zechariah 4:5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said,\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# 7. Zechariah 4:6a Then he said to me,\u0026hellip;particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained.# 8. Zechariah 4:6b \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,\u0026hellip; this is a specific message to Zerubbabel. who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12).# a. His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge.# 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what God commanded. Ezra 5:2# 9. Zechariah 4:6c \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,\u0026hellip;\u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip;# The Lord of Hosts tells governor Zerubbabel it\u0026rsquo;s not by political power that the temple will be built but by The Holy Spirit. Zerubbabel will have to rely on God\u0026rsquo;s strength not in the provision of the Medo-Persian government.\na. The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they began rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14# This is a wonderful illustration to show God wants us to live as Christians. The teaching of God\u0026rsquo;s grace is what instructs us how to really live; to trust, to depent on God for His strength (My Spirit) not our own (power). Titus 2:11-12# b. All believers get their enabling strenghtening by grace (Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2)# Grace teaches God\u0026rsquo;s full provision for salvation from sin\u0026rsquo;s penalty but also for the provision of daily living being delivered from sin\u0026rsquo;s power.# This is certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026ldquo;ease does not produce strength\u0026rdquo;. God doesn\u0026rsquo;t need strength, he desires trust.# 10. Zechariah 4:7a \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; nothing is too great for the man who has the Lord of Hosts battling for him. A weak man who is God\u0026rsquo;s instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable!# 11. Zechariah 4:7b and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is the final capstone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how?# Not by man\u0026rsquo;s might but by God\u0026rsquo;s power! The shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba imply that the people will understand it is God\u0026rsquo;s doing, not man\u0026rsquo;s.# a. God\u0026rsquo;s power, God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit glorifies God, not our strength (might, prowess, ability, wisdom) but the shouts of Grace, grace, demonstrates that a simple trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth\u0026hellip;God did it! This is God using Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s hands as instruments to bring glory to himself.# 12. Zechariah 4:8-9a Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Haggai 2:23# This is not Zerubbabel standing on the podium, receiving all the applause saying \u0026ldquo;glory to God\u0026rdquo;.# 13. Zechariah 4:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.# This is the people rejoicing in response to and giving credence to God\u0026rsquo;s provision.# 14. Zechariah 4:10 \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things?# a. The second temple wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite as glorious as the first. The older generation that had seen Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple might want to be dissapointed.# i) When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with raw materials. He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world.# 15. Zechariah 4:10 But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel— a plumb line is used for building. God would be pleased to see the reconstruction back in full swing.# 16. Zechariah 4:10 these are the eyes of the LORD the seven eyes Revelation 5:6# Zechariah 4:10 which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;# 17. Zechariah 4:10 But these seven\u0026hellip;will see and be glad\u0026hellip; Don’t despise things that appear small! What matters is how the Lord sees it!# 17. Zechariah 4:11 Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; The lamp doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to draw Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s attention like the olive trees on each side.# 18. Zechariah 4:12a And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,# 19. Zechariah 4:12b which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;# 20. Zechariah 4:13 So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# 21. Zechariah 4:14 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; The Olive trees serve to provide an unending stream of oil for the lamp to stay lit.# This is a lamp that needs no human intervention like the lamp in the temple that constantly needed to be refilled with oil.# Zechariah 4:14b Lord of the whole earth\u0026hellip; Is clearly a reference to Christ. Revelation 11:4# F. Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll# 1. Zechariah 5:1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,# 2. Zechariah 5:2 \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; This could be the scroll that Christ opens in Revelation 5. Isaiah 30:8# The scroll happens to have the same dimensions as the holy place in the tabernacle and Solomon\u0026rsquo;s porch.# 3. Zechariah 5:3a Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; Not earth but the land of Israel.# 4. Zechariah 5:3b surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, Malachi 3:6-9# 5. Zechariah 5:3c and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.# 6. Zechariah 5:4a \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts,# 7. Zechariah 5:4b \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name;# The religious leaders were responsible for the spiritual wellbeing. Psalm 78:70-72; Isaiah 44:28; 63:11; Jeremiah 23:1-4; 25:34-38# The house of the thief and theone who swears falsely in my name could be a reference to the temple.# Matthew 21:13 And He said to them, \u0026ldquo;It is written, \u0026lsquo;MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER\u0026rsquo;; but you are making it a ROBBERS\u0026rsquo; DEN.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 23:38, John 10:1# 8. Zechariah 5:4c and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo; Leviticus 14:45# G. Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket# 1. Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;# 2. Zechariah 5:6a I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo;# 3. Zechariah 5:6b-7 Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; It is possible that the lead cover symbolizes ministery of the Holy Spirit in restraining evil.# 4. Zechariah 5:8 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; The identity of the woman in the basket is given as the representation of wickedness.# 5. Zechariah 5:8 And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.# 6. Zechariah 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings;# 7. Zechariah 5:9 and they had wings like the wings of a stork,# 8. Zechariah 5:9 and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.# 9. Zechariah 5:10 I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; The destination of the woman in the basket is asked. Wickedness is being removed from the land of Israel, but where?# 10. Zechariah 5:11 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; Wickedness will be carried away from the land of Israel to Shinar.# Very early on, Shinar is seen as the crib of an organized, centralized commerce system and religion.# Genesis 11:2, 4 It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there..They said, \u0026ldquo;Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;# 11. Zechariah 5:11 and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo; Once the temple is prepared, wickedness will be set up as an object of worship.# H. Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots# 1. Zechariah 6:1-3 The Vision# a. Zechariah 6:1a Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth\u0026hellip; Zechariah looks and he sees four chariots coming.# 1) Chariots were used in battle. These chariots are going out in a war-like fashion to execute judgment. Psalm 46:9# 2) Chariots often symbolize power and authority. Psalm 20:7, Isaiah 66:15, Habakuk 3:8, Haggai 2:22# b. Zechariah 6:1b from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. The chariots came from between two mountains.# 1) We are not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. There is no reason to think these mountains are not physical locations since the destination of the chariots are geographical locations, therefore the place of origin must be as well. Zechariah 6:8# 2) Which two mountains could these be referring to? We are not told. It may be that the place of origin of the chariots are mount zion and mount olives divided by the valley of Jehoshafat. Zechariah 14:4# i) The bronze in Scripture is often where God’s judgement deals with sin. Numbers 21:9, John 3, Revelation 1:15# ii) The valley of Jehoshaphat is related in Scripture to the judgment of the nations.# c. Zechariah 6:2-3 With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses...# d. earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three colours of horses. The meaning of the horse colors are not explained to us.# i) red - symbolizes war and bloodshed# ii) Black - symbolizes death and famine# iii) White - symbolizes triumph and victory# iv) Strong dappled or grizzled - possibly plagues# There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does equate to identity.# 2. Zechariah 6:4-8 The Interpretation# a. This vision clearly shows how the Lord almighty is in control over sovereigns. It regards divine judgment on Gentile nations rin relation to their poor treatment to Israel. Isaiah 66:15# b. Zechariah 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wishes to know the identity of the horse pulled chariots.# c. Zechariah 6:5 The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, The angel\u0026rsquo;s answer refers to the question Zechariah makes.# The word spirits (RUACH) can be translated breath, wind, or spirit# These are four spirits sent out before the Lord. Four spirits (winds) many times refers to divine judicial judgment. Jeremiah 49:8, Daniel 7:2, Revelation 7:1# d. Zechariah 6:6a with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, One group of horses goes north. The other goes south.# 1) Directions in Scripture are usually in relation to Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem is the center (naval) of the earth according to God. Ezekiel 38:12, Ezekiel 5:5# i) Jewish tradition teaches that the center of Israel is Jerusalem. The center of Jerusalem is the Temple which has the holy place as its center which contains the ark in its center and in the center of the ark.# 2) West of Jerusalem is the Mediteranean sea. East is an impassable desert. Because of the geography of Israel, all of their attackers came from the north or south.# 3) Therefore, the black horse goes north of Jerusalem. Typically invadors attacked Israel from the north or from the south. Babylon would have invaded Israel from the north. South of Israel is Egypt. Ezekiel 39:2# e. Zechariah 6:6b-7a while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; All the chariot teams seem eager to execute the command.# f. Zechariah 6:7b And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth.# 1) The reality is that God will execute judgment on all of Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemies.# g. Zechariah 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The Lord now responds to Zechariah.# 1) It is probable that verse 6 and verse 8 refer to Babylon. If this is the case, this is merely a temporary appeasement of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath against Babylon since Babylon will be reserved for judgment. Zechariah 5:5-11# h. Zechariah 6:8 have appeased My wrath in the land of the north. - God\u0026rsquo;s wrath was already appeased since Babylon had fallen to Cyrus. Daniel 5# i. The black horses followed by the white horses brought judgment upon the land of the north and appeased God\u0026rsquo;s anger.# 1) We conclude these must be angelic envoys sent by the Lord of all the earth.# j. The message of this vision is clear. God will have vengeance on those nations who have mistreated Israel.# I. Zechariah 6:9-15 The conclusion: a crown fit for The King# The following section is not a vision but wonderfully culminates the 8 visions and sets forth a clear message of the ultimate purpose in God\u0026rsquo;s program. Perhaps this is the greatest section in Zechariah regarding the Messiah\u0026rsquo;s work.# 10. Zechariah 6:9-10a The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; Zechariah was instructed to receive an offering (not demand it) from these exiles. These exiles were gracious givers who wanted to contribute towards the temple building. Ezra 1:4, 6# While it is not Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s job to receive offerings for the building project, God sends Zechariah to collect this special offering and will give it a singular purpose.# 11. Zechariah 6:10b and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. God specifically tells Zechariah to go to a specific person\u0026rsquo;s house and meet those men there.# 12. Zechariah 6:11 \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. This calls the attention of the listener. Crown for a priest? This is strange, as you don\u0026rsquo;t crown a priest.# Crown - The Hebrew shows it should be plural. Revelation 19:12# Kings were to be from the tribe of Judah while priests could only be from the tribe of Levi. Gen 49:10,# No king could be serve in the office of priest and no priest could serve in the office as king.# Saul - 1 Samuel 13 relates how king Saul tries to take on priestly duties to help. Though he was told he did it anyway and the consequence for doing it was that his kingdom was taken from him that very day.# Uzziah - 2 Chronicles 26# Jeroboam - as king took on the prerogative to add two other places of worship, at Dan and Bethel. Two things come into play here. He got involved in the office as priest but primarily he played with the lineage of kings, specifically the line of David. 1 Kings 12:26-31, 1 Kings 14:9, 1 Kings 11:32, 1 Kings 11:28-29# Anybody that mixed the two offices of priest and king suffered terrible consequences.# Joshua here serves as a type of a priest that will be crowned as king. To be warranted by God and the two offices joined in one person meant only one thing, this was referring to the Messiah. God\u0026rsquo;s annointed priest-king.# Christ is still a priest but is seated behind the veil on the Father\u0026rsquo;s throne. Today, Christ is not reigning as king. He has not been crowned yet. He will one day return to earth and will be crowned as king and function as priest and king in the Millenial age. Revelation 3:20# 13. Zechariah 6:12a \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, The branch is a referrence to Messiah. Zechariah 3:8, Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, Jeremiah 33:15# 14. Zechariah 6:12b for He will branch out from where He is; After the identity of this Man is established to be Messiah, we now are told what He will do.# This speaks of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s very humble beginning when He comes. Isaiah 53:2, John 19:5,# Zechariah 6:12c and He will build the temple of the LORD. This speaks of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s second coming to build the fourth temple which will be during the Millenium. Ezekiel 40-46# Ezekiel 8-11 The Shekinah glory departs from the first temple.# Ezekiel 40-46 - The Shekinah glory returns to the fourth temple.# Since the first temple was literal, we can assume the fourth temple will also be literal.# The dimensions given for the fourth temple are literal and cannot be understood unless one takes it to be a physical temple with physical measurements.# This temple will not be built until the Millenium and will only be erected during the Millenium since there is no physical temple in the Eternal State. Revelation 21:22# Prior to Jesus, the Jews always believed this verse was Messianic.# 15. Zechariah 6:13a \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor\u0026hellip;He will build the temple and he will bear the honor\u0026hellip;While Zerubbabel was instrumental in building the second temple, he was did not receive honor, God did.# The temple Jesus will build will be the millenial temple and He will receive all the honor for the building of it.# 16. Zechariah 6:13b and sit and rule on His throne. He will build the temple and set up His throne in it.# This speaks of two different roles. He sits and He rules. He sits as priest because of His finished redemptive work and rules as king from His throne. Revelation 3:20# 17. Zechariah 6:13c Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; The Priest will not only reign on a throne but His rule will be categorized by peace between the office of priest and office of king. The king will rule from His throne. This is the Davidic throne promised beforehand. 2 Samuel 7:12-16# Upon the merging of the two offices, Jesus will usher in world peace (shalom).# He brings peace with God# He bring peace of God in the heart# He brings physical, world peace# 18. Zechariah 6:14 \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. The crown(s) serves as a reminder and that Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s temple will be built. This will serve as a reminder for those generous exiles (that generation) who returned and took part building the second temple.# However it also points to a greater fulfillment in the very Man who the crown is made for, the Priest-King, Messiah who will come and build the fourth temple and reign from it.# 19. Zechariah 6:15a \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 31:10# Those who are far off is referring to the scattered people of Israel who will come to build the millenial temple.# 20. Zechariah 6:15b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. Acts 2:39# Complete obedience is referring to that which is only accessed to by faith in Jesus Christ and his finished (complete) obedience and payment for sin on the cross. This will take place when Israel as a nation recognizes Jesus Messiah.# a. the fulfillment of the covenant promises will come to pass when they as a nation are right with God. Not merely practicing the rituals but with a right heart before God. This is what will take place when Israel puts their faith in Yahweh, specifically Jesus, Yahweh.# IV. Zechariah 7-8 - The Third Message: a poor theological understanding for what it means to \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo;# A. Zechariah 7:1-14 Seeking the Lord\u0026rsquo;s favour# After the 8 visions, Zechariah now continues the theme of the book, returning to the Lord. Some 14 months have passed since Zechariah preached his first message from the Lord to return to Him. Haggai 2:12-16# As it happens, the people decided to take up national fasts to remember the temple, the destruction of Jerusalem and other important events. This has been going on for 70 years now and the people of Bethel send a group of people to ask the priests if they should continue or not.# The people, especially the older generation, missed Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple, the glory days of Jerusalem and the way things used to me. Their trust was focused on returning to those \u0026ldquo;glory\u0026rdquo; days. Jeremiah 7:4# Their theological understanding of returning is about returning to when things were better. They were mistaken to focus on the historical blessings instead of the giver of the blessings.# Their reason for seeking God was that His blessings would return, not because they were desirous to return to Him.# The next two chapters deals with clarifying this misunderstanding.# First, God will show them the error of their thinking. Then, He will show them where (or who) their faith should be placed on.# 2. Zechariah 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. 14 months had passed between Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s first last message and this third one.# 3. Zechariah 7:2 Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,# Bethel means house of God, probably about 12 miles north of Jerusalem. At the time of the writing of Zechariah, Bethel was part of Judah, not Samaria. Ezra 2:28# we don\u0026rsquo;t see Regemmelech mentioned any other place. However there is a Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father, the Assyrian king Sennacherib, and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38# a. Esarhaddon began to reign in place of his father, Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37# b. It is of some interest to note that Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, \u0026ldquo;Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.\u0026rdquo; Ezra 4:2# c. Were these two men Regemmelech and Sharezer trying to merely \u0026ldquo;appease\u0026rdquo; God?# Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king\u0026rsquo;s spokesman. If this is the same man, perhaps he had some governmental authority.# d. Bethel has a history of idolatry. It was at Bethel that Jeconiah set up a calf to be worshipped so that the people would not go down to Jerusalem to worship.# 4. Zechariah 7:3 speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain,# Zechariah 7:3 as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; This was something they had practiced over and over every year, every time the date come up.# Perhaps they might have taken note of the prophet Jeremiah\u0026rsquo;s conclusion as he lamented the destruction of Jerusalem. Though he was increadibly sad, his hope was in the Lord not on better days. Lamentations 5:21, 3:21-23# The second temple was destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus the Roman. It was destroyed on exactly the same day, (the 9th day of the 5th month) as Nebuchadnezzar burned down the first temple in 586b.C.# Today the Jews commemorate this day with fasting and morning. Instead of returning to the Lord, the religious Jews seek the temple to be returned soy they \u0026ldquo;return to God\u0026rdquo;.# Message #1 - Addressing a wrong concept of repentance# 5. Zechariah 7:4-5 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; Zechariah as priest and prophet receives the word of the Lord telling him communicate it to the people, including the priests.# Zechariah 7:4-5 When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years\u0026hellip; these fasts had been held for over 7 decades.# a. The fast of the fifth month was remembering when Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple was burned by Nebuchadnezzar in 586b.C. 2 Kings 25:8# a. The fast of the seventh month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to flee to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25# b. Fasts were also held in the fourth and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2# c. These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They were self-imposed by the people and held throughout the years of Babylonian captivity.# d. On the surface, the question being brought before the priests seems sincere. God\u0026rsquo;s answer through Zechariah will reveal a problem.# e. Perhaps many grew up practicing them and presumed they should just continue, not necessarily ever question why they got started in the first place.# Their theological understanding of what repentance meant needed to be challenged. They were more upset about the effects than the cause. To them, a return meant mourning over the evil that resulted in order to make the good return.# Their concept of returning to God was an issue of how they were affected not what God said. The very reason they were taken out of the land was not a series of mishaps but because God had said their total disregard for Him would lead to their demise.# Through this series of 4 messages, God will show them the crisis in their thinking in order to pleade with this generation of post-exile jews to change their thinking and return to Him by faith.# 5. Zechariah 7:5b \u0026hellip;was it actually for Me that you fasted? perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting to commemorate the loss of the temple among others.# In the minds of the people, especially the younger generation, it was a practice they had always done. They grew up doing it. It was normal to do it. Perhaps if the question had been, \u0026ldquo;why do you fast?\u0026rdquo;, the answer would have been, \u0026ldquo;because we\u0026rsquo;ve always done so\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.# God goes beyond the initial why question and moves to a deeper level to make them question their level of sincerity, did you consider Me when doing it? Was it me you were after? Was I the intent of your heart?# They were missing the point by asking if they should continue or not. They seem to have the presumption that what they did was right. Somehow they appear to have believed that their fasting caused their return to the land.# So God makes them questions, why had they done it in the first place? Isaiah 58:3-8# motivation for these particular fastings were not for God. Neither did God ever tell them they should be done.# Certainly the ritualistic weeping had an appearance of spirituality. Surely God would be impressed and be moved to show mercy? Isaiah 39:13# To ask if they should continue the fasts when the temple is rebuilt is a little like staring at a photograph of a person, trying to remember you, while the real person sits next to you.# Today, Christians do things out of habit in the name of God, thinking they must be done because they have been practiced for decades. Perhaps we should ask ourselves why we do what we do. Is it really for a deeper fellowship with God that we do it?# forgetting the reality behind the ritual is hanging on to an empty ritual. There is a mighty power in tradition to blind people from reality. Mark 7:13\nOne day in the future, all of Israel will weep, not for loosing out on some blessings or as a means to commemorate better days, but the day they realize it was them that had pierced their Deliverer and Messiah. Zechariah 12:10-14# 1) This is the day the nation of Israel will repent, they will change their minds and turn to God in faith to receive the forgiveness of sins through the finished work of Jesus the Messiah on the cross. Oh what a blessed day that will be! A glad reunion between a nation and their God.# One of the greatest misunderstandings of the Bible today centers around the understanding of what repentance is. In order to inspire what they consider to be repentance, many are teaching a Gospel of works. \u0026ldquo;Clean up your life and you will be saved\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;have you truly mourned for your sin?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;turn from your sin and be saved\u0026rdquo;.# What was needed for Israel to be restored? To return to God. A simple turning from what they were trusting in (idolatry) to once again trust God.# God is richly revealing His goodness, forbearance and long-suffering to lead people turn to Him. That is, to change their minds from what they are believing to believing in Him. Romans 2:4# Some teachings of \u0026ldquo;grace\u0026rdquo; essentially promote a sense of rebellion against the law of God. Grace is not contrary to the law, it is contrary to legalism. These false understandings end up promoting the believer with a license to sin.# Legalism seeks to find God\u0026rsquo;s favour either for justification or sanctification by means of law keeping. It is possible to see the Christian life as keeping with external morality, however God would question us, did you do it for Me?# Grace teaches us Christ as the means to walk with God. Grace gives us the correct motivation of a thankful heart.# In Christ the believer upholds and agrees with the law in, never rebelling against it.# On the contrary, God is never in favour of legalism. Legalism springs from self-righteousness and a complete misunderstanding of God\u0026rsquo;s perfect righteousness and man\u0026rsquo;s depravity.# The Christian is never encouraged to walk independent of God. Quite the opposite, God works all things together towards his/her utlimate good, for a life in total dependancy upon God. Isaiah 66:2, John 15:5, 19, Romans 8:32-33, Psalm 40:16-17# 6. Zechariah 7:6 \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? In a similar fashion to their fasting (ceasing from any food), eating and drinking is done without considering God but for mere physical supplement. We do it for self preservation.# Whether we eat or don\u0026rsquo;t eat makes little difference before God if our relationship with Him is estranged.# 6. Zechariah 7:7 \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# God says through Zechariah, I\u0026quot;m saying now what I said through prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos spoke to the previous generation. This generation was on their way to repeating exactly same thing. The circumstances might be different but the message is exactly the same.# The reason they were sent into exile in the first place, the reason the glorious days were over, was their own fault for not trusting the Lord. God had said through the prophets that it would happen if they did not listen.# a. Amos 4:6 \u0026ldquo;But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# b. Amos 4:7 \u0026ldquo;Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up.# c. Amos 4:8 \u0026ldquo;So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# d. Amos 4:9 \u0026ldquo;I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# e. Amos 4:10 \u0026ldquo;I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# f. Amos 4:11 \u0026ldquo;I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# This question demonstrates the way the people thought. They lamented over the consequences but had not learned why they lost it in the first place.# It did not seem to enter their minds that they were actually estranged with God. This really didn\u0026rsquo;t bother them. What bothered them is \u0026lsquo;keeping a good testimony\u0026rsquo;.\nTheir thinking dictated that if they would felt sorry enough, sad enough, if they truly lamented their condition, God would see them in their lamentable state and feel pity.# This is an example of a self-righteous approach and comes from a faulty understanding of God\u0026rsquo;s absolute righteousness. The only way to approach God is God\u0026rsquo;s way through God\u0026rsquo;s provision.# just like the fasting in those days was not for God, today\u0026rsquo;s Christian activities can be godless while having a certain spiritual look appeal to them. Colossians 2:20-23# Message 2 - Showing the cause; failure to walk by faith# 7. Zechariah 7:8-9 Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; God takes the nation back to a right perspective under the Mosaic law. They had willingly entered into this covenant with God.# If Israel kept the law, God would bless them. However, when Israel did not follow their part of the covenant, God was obligated to curse them.# The key thing to note is that failure to keep the Mosaic law was a given. God was not exiling them for failure to keep the law but rather for their failure to walk with Him in order to keep the law.\nFailure to listen means they were so intent on keeping the law they failed to be instructed on how God meant them to carry it out. The law was really meant to show them inadequacy so they would look to Him as they failed, as they learned and grew closer and closer to God as a result.\nThis verse is not teaching in favour of modern day \u0026ldquo;social justice\u0026rdquo;. The law was in place to protect the oppressed, not to force \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; on everyone.# God shows the people they failed. They were not dispensing fairness, brotherly kindness and compassion. Failure to keep their agreement should have been cause to seek to restore it with the other party - in this case God.# Commandments 1-4 related to God, commandments 6-10 related to man.\na. Zechariah 7:10a and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; James, the epistle written to scattered Jews says, these are the marks of true religion. James 1:27# Empty rituals, morning lost benefits caused by ones own sin is just lamentable.# They were not only neglecting but oppressing the most vulnerable in the nation.# A stranger (GER) was a legal, non-jew living in the land. Ruth the Moabite, was an example of a stranger in the land.# b. Zechariah 7:10b and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; Their hearts were against one another therefore they devised evil. Proverbs 4:23# 8. Zechariah 7:11 \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. This served as an instruction to this generation. Refusing to listen to God comes at inevitable consequences.# Their indifference to God\u0026rsquo;s word is what caused the 70 year exile.# 9. Zechariah 7:12a \u0026ldquo;*They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts# Flint is a very hard stone used for cutting and piercing things. A heart like flint is one that is hard, calloused and cannot hear God\u0026rsquo;s word.# Notice these people hardened their hearts and as a result they came to a point of being deaf. They were deaf because they chose not to not because God never gave them the ability to hear.# This perhaps seems impossible but given time and a constant indifference to the conscience and to the hearing of God\u0026rsquo;s voice, one becomes cold, indifferent and far. To the extent that one becomes deaf. Jeremiah 22:21# Zechariah 7:12a had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; Acts 6:8-15# Zechariah is the first to record this doctrine of the Spirit. It was the Spirit that prompted the prophets to speak.\nThey refused to listen to the prophets, they refused to see their failure to keep the law and need to turn to God in faith. Acts 7:51-53# When Stephen reminded the first century Jews about this and they stoned him. Acts 7:54-60# Matt# 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. They did not keep the covenant, so in keeping with the agreement, the wrath of God came. Did they return to God when they realized this? Unfortunately no.# For over 1000 the Scriptures were warning them of this. Deuteronomy 28:49-50# It is easy to misunderstand God\u0026rsquo;s wrath is brought on due to His relationship being cut off with His people. It is a faith issue, not perfection issue.# When God\u0026rsquo;s people don\u0026rsquo;t walk as they should, that is, trusting in Him, in His ways, listening to what He has to say, then God will turn to other methods to capture the attention of His people.# 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; God reverses the situation. For countless times God has been calling to them, now they get to see what it\u0026rsquo;s like when God doesn\u0026rsquo;t listen.# A relationship implies communication between each other. God had been speaking to the people but the people did not want to listen to Him. The communication was broken and the relationship suffered.# While the people seemed to be fine without God, they ignored him. When troubles came however, they called out to God for help and in turn, God did not listen to them.# Would they miss the point of God\u0026rsquo;s not answering their call?# Was God playing \u0026ldquo;the silent game\u0026rdquo; with them because He was being querulous?# Did they call out to God because they realized they needed God or because they wanted to be freed of the situation?# If God had helped them get what they desired, would it have helped the relationship?# 11. Zechariah 7:14a \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. God\u0026rsquo;s ways are perfect. He was wanted their ultimate good, since they were not in a condition to listen, He sent them into different directions where they were no longer together in the land.# Since they wanted to be like the rest of the nations, God does exactly that. He scatters them to the nations. 1 Samuel 8:5# So much of Israel\u0026rsquo;s custom revolved around the land, Jerusalem and the temple. These were given to them by God and could serve them as reminders of who He was. Yet now, in a strange land they had nothing except God. Would they turn to God to trust Him?# Storm Wind Ezekiel 1:4# Zechariah 7:14b Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;# The land was made to rest. Rest from Israel\u0026rsquo;s abuse to it but mostly, God removed them away from the land so by being alone in a strange land they might turn to God in faith.# The point being made is clear. The reason they were exiled, the reason Jerusalem and the temple was destroyed was due to their incapacity to keep the covenant agreement, not because they had not kept a certain self-appointed fast.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good that the priests had to be receiving this message too. They were a major part of the problem and their teaching needed to encourage a return to the Lord.\nIn light of this, their question seems so very insignificant and it should encourage these men from Bethel and anyone else to repent, change their minds, return to the Lord.\nB. Zechariah 8:1-23 - 10 promises concerning Jerusalem# 1-8 future laid out\n9 -13 - get busy rebuilding\n14-15 - trust in God\u0026rsquo;s promises\n16-17 - go back to the mosaic covenant\n1. Message #3 - Promises 1-7# 1. Promise #1, The Lord will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem# a. Zechariah 8:1-2 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; Zechariah 1:14-16# Zion is used many times interechangeably with Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 5:7, Isaiah 40:9, Psalm 87:2-3# # Zion can also refer to the people of Israel. Isaiah 60:14, Isaiah 52:1# Hebrews used Zion in a figurative sense to speak of the New Jerusalem. Hebrews 12:22# God is exceedingly jealous for Zion.# It would appear in this context that Zion is used as the Holy Mountain. Zion here seems more specific than just Jerusalem, it is mount Zion where Jesus will reign and be worshipped.# Zechariah 1:14, Psalm 2:6, Psalm 132:13, Ezekiel 16\nb. Zechariah 8:3a \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the only city that God says He will make his holy habitation. This will come about during the Millenial Kingdom.# 2. Zechariah 8:3 Promise #2, Jerusalem will be called the city of truth# a. Zechariah 8:3b Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,# b. Zechariah 8:3c and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; The city of Jerusalem is not this way today.# Revelation 11:8 - \u0026ldquo;Sodom in Egypt\u0026rdquo; during the tribulation.# 3. Zechariah 8:4-6 Promise #3, Jerusalem will have complete peace and safety# a. Zechariah 8:4-5 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; The elderly and the young (the most vulnerable people groups) will be safe and will not be afraid.# Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem to the ground leaving the young and the old lying on the ground. This is what this generation had seen. God says he will turn it around. Lamentations 2:21# Restoration from the exile:4. Promise #4, God will gather the Jews from the east and the west and bring them back to Jerusalem\nb. Zechariah 8:6 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.# When God announces restoration it may seem improbable but that is what is going to happen. Genesis 18:14\na. Zechariah 8:7-8a \u0026ldquo;*Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; *# Obviously east and west implies more than just Babylon. This is a worldwide return.\nand I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; Physical restoration. This sets the stage for discipline during the Tribulation. 2 Peter 3:10# 5. Promise #5, The Jews will once again be those who reflect God unto the peoples of the earth (they will be God\u0026rsquo;s people). God will work with Israel once again.# a. Zechariah 8:8b and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; This is more than just a physical return, this is when Israel will return to the Lord! Isaiah 66:8, Zechariah 12:10# This sets the stage for the blessings of the Millenial Kingdom.# Under the Mosaic covenant, Israel would be God\u0026rsquo;s special people among the nations if they kept their part. That is, they would be a nation who reflected God and God would bless them before the Gentile nations.# This is why while the Jews are in exile they are not God\u0026rsquo;s nation. They do not reflect God as a nation nor do we see God blessing them in the land of promise.# This in no way affects the Abrahamic covenant given 600 years prior that declared them as a nation to be God\u0026rsquo;s posession. This was an unconditional covenant and promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants.# So even though the Jews are in exile, they are still his people and His promises to them still hold true.# Exodus 19:5 \u0026lsquo;Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;# We can conclude by this verse that though Israel had not walked with God, there will be a time when Israel will be the people of God among the nations. This will come about because God will give them a new heart and the Spirit of God will dwell in them to empower them to walk as they should.# b. Zechariah 8:9 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, God was offering them the strength yet they were to let Him.# Zechariah 8:9 you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. pay attention to the prophets who told you to get busy rebuilding the temple. Two of these were Zechariah and Haggai. Zechariah 2:12, Ezra 5:1, 6:14# a. Zechariah 8:10 \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. There were political, economical problems. Haggai 1:3-6# They worked hard and yet had no wages. God had caused the political and economical problems.\nb. Zechariah 8:11 \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.# God has changed his disposition. The current group would have a very different treatment if they returned to HIm.\n6. Promise #6, The land will be a blessing and yield fruit# a. Zechariah 8:12a \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; Deuteronomy 28:1-14 Quoting by way of blessing if they went back tothe Mosaic covenant. Matthew 6:33# Israel had experienced times of cursing in the land, times of discipline away from the land. This speaks of a time of great blessing in the land.# b. Zechariah 8:12b and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.# Notice how God is actively making this to come about. Believing Israel \u0026ldquo;the remnant\u0026rdquo; will have as an inheritance off these things. Not by their doing or by their obedience but because God causes it to come to pass for those who believe in Him.# In other words, God is saying that when they were focused on their homes, econbnomy, politics, etc God made it harder for them. HOwever, now as they focus on the temple, God would supply all their needs in abundance. Matthew 6:33\n7. Promise #7, Israel will become a blessing to the nations# a. Zechariah 8:13 \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing.# Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; Do not fear, trust me! This reminder is listed 365 times in the Bible. How do you stop being afraid? Trust God\u0026rsquo;s promises. Zechariah 8:14-15# Again he says, let you hand be strong. In other words, trust me, let me strengthen you!\nIn just the same way that Israel has been a stigma among the Gentile nations, God will turn it around. He will reunite the houses (people) of Judah and Israel. They will be one nation under God. He will deliver them and they will no longer be a curse but a blessing to the other nations.# God told them this so that they would take courage. They could find strength in this future promise.# trust in promises 14-15\nb. Zechariah 8:14-15 \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented,. God purposed to bring harm against His people. Why? Because God relentlessly held them to the covenant they had entered into with God. God never quit upholding His part.# God disciplines those He loves. He is relentless because he loves his people. Hebrews 12:5\nso I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! With that same relentless passion, God says he has purposed to do good to the city of Jerusalem and His people. Malachi 3:8-11, Jeremiah 29:11# Just like there were clauses regarding cursing in the covenant, there were clauses regarding obedience that resulted in blessings. Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 26# Once again, he reiterates, do not fear. God says, \u0026ldquo;when you trust me, you have nothing to fear!\u0026rdquo; Proverbs 28:1,# In a similar sense, for the church age, we have nothing to fear when we trust God! 2 Timothy 1:7# Heart sins = Zechariah 8:16-17 - based on what has been previously discussed, God says, rather than focussing on morning, go back to keeping the covenant.\na. Zechariah 8:16 \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment# Because of who they were, because of their association with God as a people, the natural course of action should be to reflect God in their dealings with one another.# They as a community should be truth tellers within the assembly of the believing.\nThey were to be people of judgment. They should make judgments according to truth. Deuteronomy 13:1-5,\nWe aren\u0026rsquo;t to judge regarding people\u0026rsquo;s motives. And we aren\u0026rsquo;t to judge hypocritically. Matthew 7:1-6\nfor peace in your gates. They were to be people who promote peace. Primarily with each other.# b. Zechariah 8:17 \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, Zechariah 7:10# Heart sins: These are sins committed in the heart.# beware! private thoughts will eventually lead to public actions. Proverbs 4:23# 500 years before Jesus, Zechariah was instructing against heart sins. Matthew 5-7# Zechariah 8:17 and do not love perjury;\u0026rdquo; Loving to lie is something the Lord detests. False weights are an example of what this is talking about. Jeremiah 5:30-31# The treatment they had for eachother was reflective of who they had as God. Love for one another and being honest were two key points in the Mosaic covenant.# Swearing by God\u0026rsquo;s name and lying were probably strategies of business learned from their time in Babylon. They went from farming to commerce. They learned to take advantange of their neighbour (telling them untruths) and used God (using God\u0026rsquo;s name in vain) to legitimize business. Matthew 5:33-37# These two sum up the two aspects of the law. 4 laws were regarding their relationship with God and 6 dealt with their interaction with fellow man.# This did not reflect God\u0026rsquo;s ways established for Israel.# In regards to false prophets, though they are more at fault, it does not mean the people were innocent. The people wanted to hear things they liked. If the people would judge according to truth, false teaching would dry up.# In a similar way today, there would be no business for false teachers if the people of God would judge according to truth.# for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD. God is a God who loves, but He says there are things He hates.# hauty eyes, lying tongue (perjury), hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness (perjury), one who spreads strife among the brothers (seek peace).# Jesus also is quoted saying he hates the sin of the nicolaitans. This was something that a group of people were teaching. Possibly a teaching that promoted laity-clergy distinction. Revelation 2:6# Message #4 - Fasting will become joy, gladness and cheerful feasts# 8. Promise #8, God will turn their mourning into gladness# a. Zechariah 8:18-19a *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months\u0026hellip;*Four fasts were held every year conmemorating the byproduct of their sin.# Religion thrives on ceremony. The greater the number of rituals, the higher the religion.# Religion must of needs highlight the problem but only the God of the Bible provides full and complete restitution by grace.# Zechariah 8:19b \u0026hellip;will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; The pharisees walked around with sad faces because that was the image of spirituality.# True spirituality is God\u0026rsquo;s complete provision in Christ. One response is characteristic to Him who experiences the spirituality that comes from Christ - turns mourning into joy, gladness and cheerful feasting! Psalm 30:11,# Israel will one day experience this with God, when by faith they return to Him. Zephaniah 3:14-20# a. Zechariah 8:19b so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; Rather than focusing on mourning their losses, they should focus on loving truth and peace.# The nations of the world seek peace. Yet it is at the cost of truth. Unless there is true justice, truth divides, therefore the nations of the world are willing to do away with truth to establish \u0026ldquo;world unity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;peace\u0026rdquo;*.# 9. Promise #9, Gentiles will pour into Jerusalem to seek God\u0026rsquo;s favor# a. Zechariah 8:20 Thus says the LORD of hosts,\u0026rsquo; It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities.# This prophesies a crowd coming from cities will come. Honor and popularity will be returned to Jerusalem as the capital. There will be unity among the people. Israel and Judah will be united as one nation. The cities speaks of the cities of Israel.# Reason of exaltation\na. Zechariah 8:21 \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; We see the urgency of going, \u0026ldquo;let us go at once\u0026rdquo; to seek the favour of the Lord.# This is how the conversation had began\u0026hellip;they were seeking the favour of the Lord.\nThe people don\u0026rsquo;t go to see a statue or buy an idol but to seek the favor of the Lord and seek Him.# Location of the exaltation\nb. Zechariah 8:22 \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; The people of many nations come to Jerusalem. The fulfilment of this will be when Jesus is reigning in the city of Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:16-18# Why do people come to go to Jerusalem? Because that is where Jesus is.\n10. Promise #10, The Jew will be seen as a blessing to the Gentiles# Preeminence of city of Jerusalem\na. Zechariah 8:23 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is Israel being God\u0026rsquo;s people and God being their God.# In the kingdom, 10 gentiles will grab the garment of one jew to ask him to take them to Jerusalem to seek the Lord.# The center of the world will be Jerusalem because Jesus will be there. Isaiah 49:22-23, Deuteronomy 28:13# God\u0026rsquo;s blessing upon the jews will be undeniable. People of all nations will recognize the God of the Jews and seek to find favor with Him through the access available to the Jew.# This was God\u0026rsquo;s purpose with the nation of Israel from the beginning. They were to be a light unto the Gentiles. They were to be a vessel of pointing the way to God.# Interestingly, after Satan is released from the abyss after 1000 years, he immediately attacks Jerusalem. Revelation 20:9# These future promises were to encourage the returnees in the present.# The church also has many wonderful promises for the future which are to impress on us in the present.# V. Zechariah 9:1-14:21 - The Fourth Message: God\u0026rsquo;s Way to \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo; is offered yet rejected. The \u0026ldquo;return\u0026rdquo; is remembered, God\u0026rsquo;s Way believed and the return is realized# B. Zechariah 9:1-11:17 The First Burden - The Kingdom of God is prepared and offered# A. The following 5 chapters were probably written at a later date of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s ministry.# Many skeptics have tried to discredit the authenticity of chapers 9-14 saying it is not the same author as the first 8 chapters. However these arguments are untenable and can be refuted.# Difference of style is not a conclusive argument for different authorship because style of writing can change with different circumstances.# # Chapters 9-11 have to do with foretelling how God will come to Israel in the person of Jesus Christ and offering them to return to Him and set up His kingdom. They will reject Messiah and his offer.# Chapters 9 and 10 prophetically explain the time period when Israel was subjugated under Greece.# Chapter 11 foretells when she is under Roman domination.# Chapters 12-14 have to do with foretelling how God will not postpone the promised blessings due to Israel\u0026rsquo;s return to the Lord.# Like the prodigal son returned back to his father, we are told so too Israel as a nation will one day return wholeheartedly to their God through faith in Jesus Christ as Messiah.# Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, \u0026ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rdquo;# Israel rejected this offer but out of that rejection God will create a new administration inclusive of the Gentiles.# During this time, God will not work around one nation but through a new assembly, an organism composed of Jews and Gentiles known as The Church of Jesus Christ. Romans 9:25-29# God temporarily changed his focus from buidling a nation to building a spiritual gathering because of Israel\u0026rsquo;s persistent unbelief. Romans 9:30-33# The Jews that believe during the timeframe of the Church are included in the Church. Sadly, by and large Jews continue rejecting to return to the Lord.# 1 Peter 2:25 For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.# Though Israel as a nation rejected their Messiah, Like a loving father, God continues working circumstances throughout history towards Israel\u0026rsquo;s future return.# God is a God who is tied to keep his Word.# Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!\u0026hellip;For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15\nBurden #1 contains three chapters.# Chapter 9 - hymn# Chapter 10 - Messiah rejected# Chaper 11 - False shepherd# Verses 1-8 judgment on oppresive nations surrounding Israel using Alexander the Great. Then comes Messiah unlike Alexander, he was a humble man.# 300 years before Jesus came, God will use a Macedonian king named Alexander the Great to judge surrounding nations. The Greek language and culture became popularized throughout the world. This will set the scene for Messiah\u0026rsquo;s arrival.# Zecharia 9:1-6 A Hymn of Divine Conquest and Protection# 1. Zechariah 9:1-8 Judgement of nations in the land, preparing the way for God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah.# a. After the battle of Issus in 333bC., Alexander the Great\u0026rsquo;s conquered from north to south beginning at Syria, Phoenicia and then Philistia.# i) Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of Syria.# ii) Tyrus and Sidon are principal cities of Phoenicia# iii) Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of Philistia.# 2. Zechariah 9:1a The burden of the word of the LORD# Generally speaking, a burden is something God puts on somebody\u0026rsquo;s heart. 1 Corinthians 9:16, Jeremiah 20:9# The word burden (MASSA) in conection to prophecy should be understood as a catastrophic judgment imposed on the prophet to be discharged with a sense of urgency. Zechariah 12:1, Malachi 1:1, Isaiah 13:1# Zechariah 9:1b is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place\u0026hellip; uncertain. Hadrach (Chadrak) is a syrian deity. This city no longer exists but has been identified as existing between Hamath and Aleppo.# a. Damascus means a well-watered land in Syriac.# 4. Zechariah 9:1 (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD).# This verse could also be translated \u0026ldquo;for the Lord has his eyes upon men and upon the tribes of Israel\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Zechariah 1:8,# a. The Lord sees all and takes into account everything and executes judgment and blessing accordingly. Zechariah 9:8, Proverbs 15:3# 5. Zechariah 9:2a And Hamath also, which borders on it; Amos 6:2, 2 Kings 25:18-21# 6. Zechariah 9:2b Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. Cities in the land of Lebanon. The king of Tyre serves as a type or an example of Satanic force behind a king. Ezekiel 28:12-17# Though Tyre and Sidon are wise, it will not save them.# These cities were wise in their own eyes. Ezekiel 28:3-5, Proverbs 3:7# 7. Zechariah 9:3 For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Their trust was in economic power. Their wealth was piled up. James 5:3# This fortress of wealth will not defend them. Her trust (build herself) is in piled up riches.# 8. Zechariah 9:4 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Behold, the Lord enters into action. The Lord will use Alexander the Great to plunder Tyre.# Tyre was an important commercial city with a great port that was thought to be impossible to conquer.# The Assyrians laid siege against Tyre for five years but never conquered the city.# Nebuchadnezzar tried to conquer Tyre for 13 years# Within 7 months, Alexander took the city and burned it to the ground.# The nations saw this and feared. Ezekiel 27# Zechariah 9- - Philistia es dealt with\n9. Zechariah 9:5a Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. One of five main Philistine cities. Joshua 13:3, 1 Samuel 6:17# It was Ashkelon that historically caused God\u0026rsquo;s people to be afraid.# “see it and be afraid” in Hebrew is a play on words, TERE and TIRA.# 10. Zechariah 9:5b Gaza too will writhe in great pain; She inflicted pain on Israel, now she will suffer pain.# 11. Zechariah 9:5c Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. We are uncertain what her expectation was but God takes it away.# 12. Zechariah 9:5d Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza,# Zechariah 9:5e and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.# Zechariah 9:6a And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, God destroyed the cities and people and mixed them with a hybrid people. It may have been Alexander’s policy to mix the conquered peoples with each other.# 13. Zechariah 9:6b And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. Jeremiah 25:20, Amos 1:6-8, Zephaniah 2:4-7# 1 Peter 5:5, Proverbs 16:18\nZechariah 9:7-\nZechariah 9:7 And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Philistine paganism involved drinking blood. It refers to idolatry.# 14. Zechariah 9:7b Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, This appears to be saying there will be a remnant of believers among the Philistines. Ezekiel 33:25# Zechariah 9:7c And Ekron like a Jebusite. When David conquered Jerusalem the Jebusites inhabited the city. David let them live and they were incorporated into Israel, Ekron will be same. 2 Samuel 24:16, 1 Chronicles 21:18# 15. Zechariah 9:8 But I will camp around My house because of an army, While God is judging the surrounding nations, He is also protecting Israel, Jerusalem and the temple.# This is probably referring more to the protection of his people, Israel though all are ultimately included.# Zechariah 9:8 My house By this time the temple had been standing for about 200 years.# Zechariah 9:8 Because of him who passes by and returns; This was fulfilled about 200 years later in 333b.C. when Alexander refrained from destroying Jerusalem.# a. According to the historian Josephus, after Alexander took Gaza he made his way quickly to Jerusalem. When the high-priest heard this he ordered that the people should cry out to God and ask for protection.1# At that time the high priest had a dream where he was told to take courage, adorn the city and open the gates and that the rest appear in white garments and that all the priests should wear their priestly garments.1# According to the dream the priest acted entirely, and waited for Alexander. When Alexander saw them, everybody was in white and the high priest in purple, he approached by himself and fell before him.# Later on, when asked why he had adored the priest, Alexander said, \u0026ldquo;I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit\u0026hellip;and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind.\u0026rdquo;1# 16. Zechariah 9:8 And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Zechariah 9:1, Jeremiah 16:17, Isaiah 60:18, Ezekiel 28:24# Zechariah 9:9 - Description of Messiah\n17. Zechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! This is perhaps the most known verse of Zechariah. It was fulfilled during Palm Sunday about 2000 years ago, 500 years after it was written.# 18. Zechariah 9:9a Behold, your king is coming to you; 500 years prior, Zechariah announced the coming of their melech Yisrael! For Israel to have a king meant political sovereignty and deliverance from the oppression of vassal nations.# Judah was overthrown by Babylon and taken into captivity. When they returned, they were subject to the whims of the Medo-Persians. Even though Zerubbabel was in the direct line of Davidic, he was not king. This confirms Coniah\u0026rsquo;s curse. Luke 3:27, Matthew 1:12, Jeremiah 22:30# God wanted a king for Israel. He just had a certain kind of king in mind, not the kind Israel desired.# The king the people wanted was like the other nations. 1 Samuel 8:4-6# God wanted a king that was unlike pagan nations. A king that was just, righteous, faithful and good. Deuteronomy 17:14-20# 19. Zechariah 9:9b He is just and endowed with salvation, a just king equipped with deliverance! Salvation is spiritual peace with God. Isaiah 45:21, 53:11, Jeremiah 23:5-6, Malachi 4:2# Why wasn\u0026rsquo;t the kingdom established upon His first visitation?# It was not because they did not enthrone the Messiah. No! John 6:15, Romans 9:33# In fact, He did not permit them to enthrone Him by force.# In order for Him to reign as their Messiah King, they needed to return to the Lord first! Jeremiah 24:7, Malachi 3:7, 2 Chronicles 7:14# It is not the people of Israel who enthone the Messiah but God will do so over his enemies. Psalm 110:1# 20. Zechariah 9:9c Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Unlike Alexander, God in human flesh came to earth and chose to be born in a manger and rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. Luke 2:7# Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding a horse like Alexander the Great?# There are over 188 mentions of horses in the Bible. It may surprise you to know that Israel did not have horses.# When the the decalog prohibits covetting, it does not mention horses yet it names oxen and donkeys. Surely horses are would be more desireable than donkeys\u0026hellip;# Exodus 20:17 \u0026ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u0026rdquo;# Archeological digs have found that all the nations in the area had horses but not Israel, that is, not until the time of Solomon in 970b.C. and that was out of disobedience. 1 Kings 10:26# The reason that Israel never had horses is expressly stated in the second giving of the law.# Deuteronomy 17:15-16a you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses\u0026hellip;“But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:# God had told the Israelites not to have horses so that they would not become dependent once again on Egypt, since Egypt was the primary provider of horses at the time.# The reason why they are not allowed to own horses goes back to something God had said when He delivered Israel from Egypt\u0026hellip;# Deuteronomy 17:16b forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, ‘Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.’”# When God delivered Israel from Egypt, he wanted them to make a clean break and that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any reason to ever want to return. If Israel was not to return to Egypt, they must not trade with Egypt in any form.# Years later when King Solomon disobeyed and aquired horses that is exactly what ocurred\u0026hellip;# 1Kings 10:28 Also Solomon\u0026rsquo;s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king\u0026rsquo;s merchants procured them from Kue for a price. 1 Kings 10:26-29# Knowing this fact that Israel was not to own horses, Psalm 20 verses 7 through 9 make a lot more sense.# Psalm 20:7 Some boast in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.# Psalm 20:8 They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright.# Psalm 20:9 Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.# God did not want the people of Israel to conquer the land trusting in horses and chariots but in God. Zechariah 10:5# David conquered the land on foot. Therefore David\u0026rsquo;s triumphs are really God conquering the land for them. Psalm 18:39-50# Proverbs 21:31, “The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but deliverance is of the Lord.”# Therefore, in humility, in keeping with the law and in trusting the Father, Jesus the king entered Jerusalem riding on what is possibly a fine-bread donkey. What a magnificent entrance in keeping with everything God is and does!# Jesus made no exceptions when dealing with Himself in His first coming. He came under the law not to rebel against it but to fulfill it.\nAll four gospels state this verse is fulfilled upon the triumphal entering into Jerusalem. Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19# Matthew 21:1 And when they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,# Matthew 21:2 saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them, and bring them to Me.# Matthew 21:3 \u0026ldquo;And if anyone says something to you, you shall say, \u0026lsquo;The Lord has need of them,\u0026rsquo; and immediately he will send them.\u0026rdquo;# Matthew 21:4 Now this took place that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,# Matthew 21:5 \u0026ldquo;SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, \u0026lsquo;BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# Matthew 21:6 And the disciples went and did just as Jesus had directed them,# Matthew 21:7 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them their garments, on which He sat.# Matthew 21:8 And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and spreading them in the road.# Matthew 21:9 And the multitudes going before Him, and those who followed after were crying out, saying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!\u0026rdquo;# While on the outskirts of town people followed Jesus crying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, yet many in the city of Jerusalem had no idea who He was.# Matthew 21:10 And when He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, \u0026ldquo;Who is this?\u0026rdquo;. Matthew 21:1-10# Matthew 21:15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David,\u0026rdquo; they became indignant, Clearly the religious leaders had no small part in keeping the people confused regarding the identity of the coming King.# The people wanted political peace. When the leaders of Israel realized that they had better chances of getting political peace with Rome then they yelled, \u0026ldquo;we have no king but Caesar\u0026rdquo;.\nThe people stumbled over Jesus. The kingdom of God is more than mere politics. Entrance to the Kingdom requires absolute righteousness. This was Jesus\u0026rsquo; offer to them. Matthew 5-7\nZechariah 9:10 Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. This prophecy is not unique to Zechariah. It is aluded to back in Genesis 49.# Genesis 49:10 \u0026ldquo;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler\u0026rsquo;s staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.# Genesis 49:11 \u0026ldquo;He ties his foal to the vine, And his donkey\u0026rsquo;s colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes.# reveals Christ\u0026rsquo;s lowliness in outward condition as well as His inward disposition. The donkey is seen as the animal of peace. Genesis 49:11# Zechariah 9:10 - kingdom established upon the acceptance of their king\nThe people of Israel had suffered for hundreds of years under the oppresive hands of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medo-Persians, under Greece and upon the Kings arrival, they were under Rome\u0026rsquo;s oppresive rule.# B. Zechariah 9:10-10:12 The Messiah\u0026rsquo;s offer\u0026hellip;Since Israel rejected their Messiah on his first visit, these promises were postponed until the second coming.# 1. Zechariah 9:10a I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim\u0026hellip; Ephraim here represents the land of the northern kingdom of Israel. Genesis 48:8-22# 2. Zechariah 9:10b And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; Jesus will return as a conquered going out to war then bring in peace. Psalm 72:8# This may be what the Horseman on the red horse in chapter one is ready to go and do. Just like the patrol returned saying there was peace on the earth while Israel suffered, now, the Angel of the Lord, The Messiah himself will bring true lasting peace upon the earth. Zechariah 1:8-17# Isaiah 2:4 And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.# The United Nations has tried to appropriate this verse taking on a Messianic role. Ironically, there have been more than 150 wars since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. This is far from bringing in peace.# It was through a series of battles that Jacob had acquired posession of the land and it has been battle after battle for Israel ever since.# This would bring great hope to a people who have experienced war since they arrived on the land. This will happen when God\u0026rsquo;s King, the Messiah will reign, He will speak peace to the nations.# Jesus will put down all warfare and strife. The chariot, the horse and the battle bow as representing weapons of warfare. he will remove all these and bring in world Shalom.\nJesus came in humility, for a time He stooped down lower than the angels, became a man, offered himself as God\u0026rsquo;s humble yet sufficient sacrificial provision for Israel\u0026rsquo;s true return, His offer was peace, true peace, eternal peace with God.# 3. Zechariah 9:10c And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.# Earth is the word (ERETS) which could be translated land, however since the definite article is not in the Hebrew we understand it is not referring to the land of Israel but rather a world wide kingdom. Psalm 72:8, Psalm 22:27-28# When Jesus comes to the earth, he will bring world peace in justice and truth. To be specific Jesus will reign from sea to sea.# John says that in the eternal state there is no sea, this therefore must be speaking of a future reign after Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time and before the eternal state.# We know this will be fulfilled during the 1000 Millenial Kingdom which is after the Tribulation and before the eternal state. Revelation 20:4-6# The entire time period between Zechariah 9:9 and 9:10 was previously unseen by Old Testament prophets.# Today, thanks to Paul\u0026rsquo;s teachings, we know it to be the church age. 1 Peter 1:10-11# This is why the Qumram arrived at the conclusion that there would be two Messiahs. Their names were Ben-Joseph and the second Messiah would be Ben-David. They believed there would be two different Messiahs. Why? Because they did not have Paul\u0026rsquo;s writings explaining the mysetery of the church.# Isaiah 9:6a For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; This portion was fulfilled on the first coming, but the second part of the verse has over 2000 years in between.# The second portion of the prophecy in this verse has yet to be fulfilled\u0026hellip;# Isaiah 9:6b And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.# Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# Today God is using the church to cause the Jews to be jealous of what they missed on Christ\u0026rsquo;s first coming. Romans 11:11, 14# The church will spend 7 years in Heaven. However, then they (the church) will reign upon the earth\u0026hellip;this is a literal 1000 year reign on the earth from Jerusalem.# Revelation 5:10 \u0026ldquo;And Thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.\u0026rdquo;# Verses 11-17 - The Maccabean victory -protection given from Antiochus IV\n4. Zechariah 9:11a As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you,\u0026hellip; In order for a covenant to be firm, it had to be ratified in blood. Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 26:28, Psalm 105:7-11# Previously we saw a covenant to the peoples which dealt with God\u0026rsquo;s holding the nations at bay so as to not allow them to completely anhilate the people of Israel.\nThis covenant however is far greater in its scope and fulfillment. It is referring to a covenant God made to Abraham. Genesis 15:9-12, 18-20,\nThis is a description of the wonderful things God will do for Israel because of his promise to her. Israel, like no other nation in the world has a covenant that God made with them. Genesis 5:9-10# When a covenant was made, customarily, both parties passed between the the parts of cut up animals. While they walked through the parties would declare that the same should happen to them if they break their covenant.# When God made a covenant to Abraham. It was a special ceremony because God did it with himself while Abraham slept. Therefore, the picture is that God made the unilateral covenant without any involvement or requirement on behalf of Israel, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants.# God made many covenants throughout Scripture. They all kept a similar pattern. God promised he would make it. Then he ratified it. Then he clarified it. Then he fulfilled it.# Ezekiel 36:22 end time regathering was undeservedly. God was being faithful to Himself. He always keeps his word. Specifically the promise he made to Abraham.# 5. Zechariah 9:11b \u0026hellip;I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit... Luke 16:24, restoration of those still in Babylon because of his covenant with them.# Cisterns without water were used as prisons. Genesis 37:24, Jeremiah 38:6# One cannot get out of a waterless pit unless someone rescues you. Genesis 37:23-28# waterless pit - Joseph, jeremiah, daniel, Psalm 40\n6. Zechariah 9:12a Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope;# God had made them rest the land. Every seven years the people were to trust God to provide while they rested the land. Since they did not trust the Lord, the kept farming the land even on the seventh year\u0026hellip;they did this for 70 seventh years. Therefore the Lord took them out of the land, one year for every seventh year the land wasn\u0026rsquo;t given rest.# 2Ch 36:21 to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until seventy years were complete.# Leviticus 26:34 \u0026lsquo;Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies\u0026rsquo; land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.# Leviticus 26:35 \u0026lsquo;All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it.# 7. Zechariah 9:12b This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. When God gets you out of the pit, he promises to make up double. Isaiah 61:7# Job was granted double after his trials. Job did not know what God was going to do. Job 42# Exodus 12:17 \u0026lsquo;You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.# Daniel 8:21-25, 11:23-35\nZechariah 9:13-17 Macabean War - feast of dedication/festival of lights. John 10:22-24\n8. Zechariah 9:13a For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. This image of a bow and arrow refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together as God\u0026rsquo;s bow and arrow in battle.# 9. Zechariah 9:13b And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece;# Times of the Gentiles:# Babylon 605-539 b.C.# Medo-Persia - (Daniel 5) 539-331b.C.# Greece - Alexander 331-64b.C.# If Zechariah lived in the 500\u0026rsquo;s bC. how could Zechariah have seen the Grecian era? Daniel 10:20# The reference of greece is no problem if you believe God knows the future.# 10. Zechariah 9:13c-14a And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them,# 11. Zechariah 9:14b *And His arrow will go forth like lightning; *# This is a type of How the Lord will come at the end of the tribulation. Matthew 24:27\nAnd the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, This is not the rapture at the last trump. God has more than one trumpet sound. THis is for Israel.# And will march in the storm winds of the south.# storm winds of the south - God has been known to create the whirlwinds. Job 1:19\nThe Jewish people threw off the bonds of Antiochus iV for about 100 years. Zechariah 9:11\n12. Zechariah 9:15a The LORD of hosts will defend them. God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord of Hosts, is he who is ready to go to battle for them. Psalm 27:10# a. Zechariah 9:15a And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; no weapon formed against God will prosper. Isaiah 54:17# rather these peoples will become stones in the crown of the King.\nb. Zechariah 9:15a And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine;# c. Zechariah 9:15a And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,# d. Zechariah 9:15a Drenched like the corners of the altar.# 13. Zechariah 9:16a And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; Save here is not referring to salvation from the penalty of sin but rather it is saying that The Lord of Hosts will deliver them from their oppressors.# That day here is not the Day of the Lord but this day, Hanukah serves as a type of the deliverance that will occur in the Tribulation.# This is the day of victory when the Jews will miraculously overthrow the diabolical reign of Antiochus Epiphanes 167b.C..# Zechariah 9:16b For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.# Zechariah 9:17a *For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs!# These are the covenant blessings that will come to Israel when she returns to the Lord. Deuteronomy 28:1-14# Israel will no longer be despised but will be an attractive nation. People will want what the Jews have.# Zechariah 9:17b Grain will make the young men flourish,# Zechariah 9:17c and new wine the virgins.# Zechariah 10:1-12 The True Shepherd# Zechariah 10:1a Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain - droughts on the land came about because of their wrong relationship with the Lord.# rain is simbolic of blessing or prosperity.\nSpring is when they sow their seed. This is important to planting season. Joel 2:23# Zechariah 10:1b The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. why ask God for rain? Because he is the one who makes the clouds to rain. Job 36:27-28# Why would there be no rain? Because God has devised that people still need to trust in the King for their daily provision. This is a means to impress upon the people to depend on God. Jeremiah 14:22, Joel 2:23-27# 17. Zechariah 10:2a For the teraphim speak iniquity,# The teraphim refers to many idols. They were household gods used for divination, probably shaped like human beings. Judges 17:4-5, 1 Samuel 19:13, 16# The idolatry in the land, the household idols came into their homes and people were looking to these idols for provision instead of God.# Zechariah 10:2a And the diviners see lying visions Deuteronomy 18:14, Jeremiah 27:9, Jeremiah 29:8, Micah 3:7# Zechariah 10:2a And tell false dreams; Jeremiah 23:32# Zechariah 10:2b They comfort in vain. Job 21:34, Jeremiah 6:13-14, Jeremiah 37:19# Zechariah 10:2b Therefore the people wander like sheep, Though they provide an immediate feeling of comfort, it is in vain because it was not based on reality. Acts 19:19# Zechariah 10:2c They are afflicted, As long as these people were clinging to this idolatry, they were wandering like sheep. Zechariah 11:7, Numbers 27:17, Ezekiel 34:5, Jeremiah 50:6,# Mattew 9:36 Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. Isaiah 61:1, Isaiah 49:13, Luke 19:10# Why consult God when I can get their palm read? It provided instant gratification.# Why consult God when I have a god for that? A god for every want.# The people were consulting demons or learning doctrines of demons and being \u0026lsquo;guided\u0026rsquo; by this. They were wandering aimlessly.# Saul lost his kingdom by consulting mediums.# Zechariah 10:2c because there is no shepherd. Sheep don\u0026rsquo;t do well without a shepherd.# Sheep aimlessly wander without a shepherd. A shepherd leads to water, leads to grass for food. A shepherd protects and keep the sheep safe.# Just like sheep without a shepherd are sheep lying in wait to be preyed on, so too the nation of Israel was open season for tragedy.# God\u0026rsquo;s intent to\nZechariah 10:3a \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; Ezekiel 34:17# The male goats are the civil leaders, who are worthy of blame for what has occurred.\nZechariah 10:3b For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah,# As sheep become restless and wander, now the Lord of Hosts has come.

Notice how we see contrasted Judah with the Gentile nations. The Gentiles are those with the horses.# Zechariah 10:6 \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back,# Judah is the southern kingdom. After solomon\u0026rsquo;s idolatry, the united kingdom of Israel between the 10 tribes to the north called Israel and two tribes to the south called Judah. 1 Kings 11\nThis verse is stating the reunion the political union of the tribes of the north with the tribes of the south.\nToday, nobody knows where the 10 tribes are specifically. They appear to be spread out around the earth. Yet when this occurs, God will save them, he will get them from where they are and rescue them.\nAnd God will bring them all back into the the land.\nZechariah 10:5d Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them,# God demonstrates his compassion with Israel even after their many rejections of Him.\nZechariah 10:5d For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.# Zechariah 10:5d \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad Though Assyria came and overtook and catthered the north, God will bring them back and make them mighty.

Israel will once again walk by faith, strengthened in the Lord.# Zechariah 11:1-3 Judgment on Israel\nZechariah 11:1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Jeremiah 22:23# Zechariah 11:2a Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed;# Zechariah 11:2b Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. God will go after the strong point of the nation. Exodus 27:6# Zechariah 11:3a There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; Jeremiah 25:34-38# God is upset with these leaders. Zechariah sees it 500 years earlier.\nZechariah 11:3b There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. everything they took pride in will be destroyed..# reasons for wailing\n4-7 doomed for slaughter\nZechariah 11:4 Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. Similar to before, Zechariah will take up mimes to explain what is going to ocurr.# Zechariah is standing in the place of the Shepherd.\nZechariah 11:5a \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, buying the sheep to slay.# The picture here is of Israel being delivered into the hand of their oppressors. Israel will be dispursed into the nations.\nZechariah 11:5b and each of those who sell them says,\u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo;# Israel is being taken to slaughter in the name of the Lord! Religious people are getting rich from this injustice.\nAnd their own shepherds have no pity on them.# Zechariah 11:6a \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD;# Zechariah 11:6b *\u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; A king is referenced here. A foreign entity they are being sold to.# This happened with Assyria, Babylon, Greece and Rome in 70AD.\nWE have no king but Caesar.\nZechariah 11:7a So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.# C. Zechariah 11:7-14: The True Shepherd\u0026rsquo;s offer is rejected\nZechariah 11:7b And I took for myself two staffs:# Two staffs. Eastern shepherds carried a rod to beat away beasts from the sheep and A crocked staff to retrieve sheep over cliff and from tangled places.\nZechariah 11:7c the one I called Favor God had chosen Israel. Deuteronomy 7:7# Zechariah 11:7d and the other I called Union; God\u0026rsquo;s desire was to take the divided nation and unite them. Ezekiel 37:15-28# Zechariah 11:7e so I pastured the flock.# Psalm 23,\nZechariah 11:8 Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month\u0026hellip;# \u0026ldquo;One writer has counted forty different interpretations of these words\u0026rdquo;.3# This verse is possibly the verse that has the most interpretations of any other verse in the Old Testament.# The context of this passage is during Christ\u0026rsquo;s first coming. The three shephers are removed within one month. Zechariah 10:3, Matthew 21:42-46# \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;These three shepherds are the Pharisees and Herodians, the Sadducees.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 22:15-16, Matthew 22:23, Matthew 22:34-354# The context referrs to the first visitation of the Messiah and these three groups were religious leaders at that time.# During His first coming, these three groups set aside their differences in order to get rid of Jesus Christ.# In order to get the death penalty, they became allies with Rome.# When Rome destroyed the temple in the 5th month 70a.D. this may have been a death blow for these groups for selling out to the Romans.# According to the Mishnah, both temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av. This could hardly be seen as a coincidence.5# Zechariah 11:8 for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. They mutually disagreed# Zechariah 11:9 Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you.# Zechariah 11:9 What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 11:10 I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. Not merely a covenant to a people Israel but to all the peoples.# \u0026ldquo;God has made a covenant with the peoples of the earth relative to His own people Israel. He has placed them under restraint lest they work Israel harm or ill.\u0026rdquo;6 Job 5:23, Ezekiel 34:25, Hosea 2:18\nRomans 15:8-9\nIn the Old Testament the church is a mystery. However, the promise has not been broken, only postponed. And postponement is not abandonment with God. That is what Zechariah 14 shows.4\nZechariah 11:11a So it was broken on that day,# Zechariah 11:11b and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me\u0026hellip;This refers to believing Israel.# Zechariah 11:11c realized that it was the word of the LORD. John 8:28# Zechariah 11:12a I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; Matthew 26:15, Mark 14:10-11# Zechariah 11:12b but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.# Zechariah 11:13a Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, The Lord told Zechariah to literally throw the 30 shekels of silver to the potter within the temple.# How could Zechariah do this? Evidently the temple was rebuilt by this time. Can you imagine this being his first sermon in the temple.# Zechariah 11:13b that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 11:13c So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. This action that Zerubbabel does in the temple sybolizes what actually occured when Jesus was betrayed by Judas.# This is the second temple (restored by Herod). This temple will be destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus on exactly the same day as Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the first temple in 586b.C.# Zechariah 11:14 Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.# D. Zechariah 11:15-17 The False Shepherd# Zechariah 11:15 \u0026ldquo;The LORD said to me, Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. Zechariah is asked to impersonate a foolish shepherd to illustrate what the people will accept as a shepherd.# Zechariah 11:16a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing,# Zechariah 11:16b seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing,# Zechariah 11:16c but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.# Zechariah 11:17a \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock!# Zechariah 11:17b A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;# E. Zechariah 12:1-14:21 The Second Burden - Messiah\u0026rsquo;s Second Coming, Israel\u0026rsquo;s return# Zechariah 12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. While the first burden was regarding the nations, this second burden is specific to Israel.# Zechariah 12:1 Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,# Zechariah 12:2 \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around;# Zechariah 12:2 and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.# Zechariah 12:3 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured.# Zechariah 12:3 And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.# Zechariah 12:4 \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment# Zechariah 12:4 and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah,# Zechariah 12:4 while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.# Zechariah 12:5 \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 12:6 \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves,# Zechariah 12:6 so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples,# Zechariah 12:6 while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:7 \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,# Zechariah 12:7 so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.# Zechariah 12:8 \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them# Zechariah 12:9 in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God,# Zechariah 12:9 like the angel of the LORD before them.# Zechariah 12:9 \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:10 \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication,# Zechariah 12:10 so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced;# Zechariah 12:10 and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, The loss of a son, an only son is among the greatest sorrows known to man. The Holy Spirit includes several instances of grieving parents over their only son.# Luke 7:12-15 Widow from Nain\nJeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10\nZechariah 12:10 and they will weep bitterly over Him# Zechariah 12:11 like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.# Zechariah 12:11 \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem,# Zechariah 12:11 like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.# Zechariah 12:12 \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself;# Zechariah 12:13 the family of the house of David\u0026hellip; Nathan\u0026hellip;Levi\u0026hellip;Shimeites by itself# Zechariah 12:13 and their wives by themselves;# Zechariah 12:14 all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.# Zechariah 13:1 \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened# Zechariah 13:7 for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.# Zechariah 132:7 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts,# Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered;# Zechariah 13:7 and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.# examples of practicing truth and justice\nZechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;;# Zechariah 13:7 and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.# Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies,# Zechariah 13:7 and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo;# 1. Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts.# 2. Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep.# a. Mark 14:27-28 And Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;You will all fall away, because it is written, \u0026lsquo;I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.\u0026rdquo;# Jesus quotes Zechariah where the Lord of Hosts declares he will Strike the Shepherd, then He continues what was written to say He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah in with the Gospel accounts.# b. Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound.# c. Isaiah 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.# i) Jesus was smitten of God. The next verse goes on to explain why\u0026hellip;# ii) Isaiah 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.# iii) The word scourging (singular) here is another word for blow or wound. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins.# d. Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do this. He would strike down the Shepherd, turn His hand against the little ones and raise the Shepherd back up. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.# The Gospel was God\u0026rsquo;s eternal plan for the redemption of man.# Zechariah 13:8 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish;# Zechariah 13:7 But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire,# Zechariah 13:9 Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested.# Zechariah 13:9 They will call on My name, And I will answer them;# Zechariah 13:9 I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 14:1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.# Zechariah 14:2 For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured,# Zechariah 14:2 the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled,# Zechariah 14:2 but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.# Second coming\nZechariah 14:3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.# Zechariah 14:4 In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; 2 Samuel 15:30, Acts 1:11-12, Matthew 24:3,# Zechariah 14:4 The last time God descended on a mountain in this way was in the giving of the law.

He therefore ordained that the people should make supplications, and should join with him in offering sacrifices to God, whom he besought to protect that nation, and to deliver them from the perils that were coming upon them; whereupon God warned him in a dream, which came upon him after he had offered sacrifice, that he should take courage, adorn the city, and open the gates; that the rest appear in white garments, but that he and the priests should meet the king in habits proper to their order, without the dread of any ill consequences, which the providence of God would prevent. Upon which, when he rose from his sleep, he greatly rejoiced; and declared to all the warning he had received from God. According to the dream he acted entirely, and so waited for the coming of the king.And when he understood that he was not far from the city, he went out in procession, with the priests and the multitude of the citizens. The procession was venerable, and the manner of it different from that of other nations. It reached to a place called Sapha; which name, translated in Greek, signifies a prospect, for you have thence a prospect both of Jerusalem and of the temple; and when the Phoenicians and the Chaldeans that followed him, thought they should have liberty to plunder the city, and torment the high-priest to death, which the king’s displeasure fairly promised them, the very reverse of it happened; for Alexander, when he saw the multitude at a distance, in white garments, while the priests stood clothed with fine linen, and the high-priest in purple and scarlet clothing, with his mitre on his head having the golden plate on which the name of God was engraved, he approached by himself, and adored that name, and first saluted the high-priest. The Jews also did all together, with one voice, salute Alexander, and encompass him about: whereupon the kings of Syria and the rest were surprised at what Alexander had done, and supposed him to be disordered in his mind. However, Parmenio [Alexander’s second-in-command] alone went up to him, and asked him how it came to pass, that when all others adored him, he should adore the high-priest of the Jews? To whom he replied, “I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit, when I was at Dios, in Macedonia, who, when I was considering with myself how I might obtain the dominion of Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but boldly to pass over the sea thither, for that he would conduct my army, and would give me dominion over the Persians; whence it is, that having seen no other in that habit, and now seeing this person in it, and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind.” And when he had said this to Parmenio, and had given the high-priest his right hand, the priests ran along by him, and he came into the city; and when he went up into the temple, he offered sacrifice to God, according to the high-priest’s direction, and magnificently treated both the high-priest and the priests. And when the book of Daniel was showed him, wherein Daniel declared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire of the Persians, he supposed that himself was the person intended; and as he was then glad, he dismissed the multitude for the present, but the next day he called them to him, and bade them ask what favors they pleased of him: whereupon the high-priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of their forefathers, and might pay no tribute on the seventh year. He granted all they desired: and when they entreated him that he would permit the Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also, he willingly promised to do hereafter what they desired: and when he said to the multitude, that if any of them would enlist themselves in his army on this condition, that they should continue under the laws of their forefathers, and live according to them, he was willing to take them with him, many were ready to accompany him in his wars.\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFeinberg, Charles L.

      "content":"Zechariah Return to Me!\nNow if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!\u0026hellip;For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15\nIn Ezekiel 23, God tells a story of two young sisters who He takes on as wives. The older sister, Oholah, desired what the Assyrians had to offer and she gave herself in harlotry to them. The younger sister, Oholibah was even worse and gave herself in like manner to the Babylonians. Both women committed abominable acts of harlotry and bare children to these nations. The two women serve as an allegory of Israel (to the north) and Judah (to the south) giving themselves in idolatry and being exiled to the nations.\nFollowing through with the story of the two women, we could continue saying Oholah and her children haven\u0026rsquo;t been heard from. Oholibah and her children have recently returned to the land after being away 70 years. God has asked them to rebuild His house.\nThis story serves as a background for the setting of the book of Zechariah. As soon as the people returned from Babylon, the returnees set up an altar to carry out the daily sacrifices and laid the foundation of the temple but soon afterwards faced opposition and the construction was stopped for about 16 years.\nThe illustrations Zechariah brings out in this book are enlightening and convicting! He has a list of appropriate examples among the people to help realize their true spiritual condition. Returnees who never returned, mourners who forgot why, a high priest in dirty duds before God, fleecing shepherds and sheep blindly following a foolish shepherd, are only some of the illustrations given in this little known book.\nThe book of Zechariah contains a powerful message. One\u0026rsquo;s view of God is profoundly impacted and challenged. It contains theologial correction, spiritual uplifting and eschotological orientation that present the historical interactions between a scruffy lot and a God who genuinely cares for them, constantly arranging and rearranging so they might return. It presents Messiah in a unique light as the eternal choice of God\u0026rsquo;s servant to bring about the return of the people, restoration to the land, national blessings and blessing to the nations and ultimate glory to God because His knowledge will fill the earth.\nYou are about to embark on the magnificent account of the ages of a prodigal nation who wanders endlessly and of a loving Father who waits tirelessly until his son, yes his dear son, comes home at last. This book is bound to encourage you as it was intended for the generation of Zechariah, to a real, intimate fellowship with God.\nZechariah is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out and some of the details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.\nZechariah clearly lays out God\u0026rsquo;s redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah.\nGod reveals His will, He calls people back to Himself and provides the way for their coming, and He promises that if they will return to Him, He will return to them.1\nThe book of Zechariah is arguably the most Messianic, apocalyptic and eschatological of all the Old Testament. Yet at the heart of it lies one single message throughout, \u0026ldquo;return to Me says the Lord\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. It is more than a command to hold them to the covenant, God reveals his heart in present and future plans for the nation to woo them back into a loving relationship with Him. He will show them the error of their thinking and prove to them of his undying devotion for her. Return to Me, is a heart felt invitation into fellowship with their maker.\nTable of Contents I.

Glossary of Terms Key Term: The Story of Israel\u0026rsquo;s Return The Background of Zechariah# Historical setting# Along with Haggai and Malachi, Zechariah is a post-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C.# The Jews returned back to the land in 538b.C. after being exiled for 70 years in Babylon. Psalm 126:1-6# Medo-Persia had overthrown the Babylonians and under Cyrus the Persian the command was given for the Jews to be allowed to go back. Ezra 2# Zerubbabel was placed in charge as governor and is given some finances for the rebuilding of the temple. Ezra 3:7-8# Upon first arriving, the Jews each went to their homes. On the first day of the seventh month, the priests and their brothers along with Zerubbabel and his brothers repaired the altar on its foundation and renewed the daily sacrifices.# Upon the second year of their coming, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple and upon completion, a great inaugural service was held praising God for his lovingkindness. Ezra 3:8-11# This caused a lot of interest on behalf of the Samaritans who wanted to help rebuild the temple. Their help was refused because though they feared God, they served other gods as well. Ezra 4:1-3, 2 Kings 17:33# When the builders refused their help, they proceeded to make all sorts of trouble. They discouraged and frightened the people of Judah from continuing to build. Ezra 4:4# The people of the land hired advisors to frustrate their efforts during the days of Cyrus and into the reign of Darius. Ezra 4:5-24# The leaders of the land and the rest of the nations that lived in Samaria and the neighbourinig area get behind these efforts, and together they issue a letter to king Artaxerxes.# The king responded their letter commanding the leaders issue a decree prohibiting the rebuilding of the city. They set up armed guards to stop any buidling activity.# The rebuilding of the temple was stopped. Instead of claiming their portion and right to Jerusalem under teh God of heaven, the people went home. Nehemiah 2:19-20# After about 16 years, Haggai and Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophetic ministries began. Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest along with the prophets, began to rebuild the temple. Ezra 5:1-2# Once again, the leaders of the land tried to oppose them. However God made it possible to continue until communication was made with king Darius. Ezra 5:3-17# after king Darius I finds Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s decree the rebuilding of the temple continues. Ezra 6:1-5# Somehow, in the change of power, the kings decree to go back and rebuild was lost and the current king, Darius I had to search through years of records and verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12# When Darius found the decree made by Cyrus with great detail, he told the governor of Samaria to leave the rebuilding of the temple alone. In fact, Darius demands the the full cost of the temple is to be paid out of the treasury of the taxes of Samaria without delay. Ezra 6:8-12# It would be four years before the Jews will successfully finish the building. Ezra 6:14-22# Two months prior to the prophecy of Zechariah, God had told the Jews through the prophet Haggai to begin work again on the temple. The Jews are discouraged and have lost hope.# The message of Zechariah is one that is intended to encourage Israel not only to return to the land and to rebuild the temple but more importantly, to a spiritual return to the Lord.# General Information# STRUCTURING of the book of Zechariah Zechariah 1:1-6 The first message: setting the theme of the book Zechariah 1:7-6 The second message: eight night visions 1.

The people return to God, He returns to them Key Term: Return Why study the book of Zechariah?# The book of Zechariah is written directly to the Jews who were returning back to the land from the 70 year exile in Babylon.# It is a message of encouragement, of hope and and restoration.# It is because of the prophecies of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the temple continued and after 4 years was completed. Ezra 6:14# Zechariah contains a forward pointing view of the Gospel that can easily be understood with past events (from our point of view) making the book a highly Evanglistic message for those with a Jewish mindset.# We would do well to learn from this book. The New Testament quotes or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.# Not only does it unfold details of prophecy, it reveals behind-the-scenes spiritual warfare# It shows how God is in control and never forgets his promises# Most importantly, it reveals to us the person of Christ Zechariah dwells on the Person and the work of Christ more fully than all the minor prophets put together. (Revelation 19:10).# It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father prior to his first coming.# It shows us his nature during his first coming and finally his galant entry and conquest on his second return as conquering king.# For the most part, apart from the visions, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s language is simple and direct.# While many will say there are difficulties in studying the book of Zechariah, the message that can be clearly understood far outweighs any difficulties. One thing that aids our understanding is the promises of the future have nothing to do with returning from Babylon.# It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological unfolding of the future but rather to present to us the very purpose of prophecy - the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God\u0026rsquo;s plan of restoration.# “The prophecy of Zechariah is to the Old Testament what the book of Revelation is to the New. It is the Apocalypse of the Old Testament which portrays God’s future dealings with His chosen people Israel . . . The book of Zechariah, especially chapter 14, stands as a continual corrective to all those theories which deny the literal, future restoration of Israel, after a period of chastening, in her own land, over whom the Messiah will reign in Zion” (334-335).2# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s immediate audience as well as the generations to follow, including the church age, would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He chose to make unconditional promises to Abraham and He will keep his word. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally. Genesis 12:1-3,# The book of Zechariah shows how God works when His people stray, always calling them back to Himself.# Zechariah will also teach how to return or turn to God and how not to.# Zechariah is a book that is seldom taught as it undoubtedly presents the interpreter with many challenges.# While Zechariah presents many future events and gives details regarding those events, the key to understanding Zechariah is not to reveal future historical narrative. Instead all the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah, Christ the Lord.# Zechariah 1:1-6 - The First Message - setting the theme of the book# Zechariah 1:1-2 Setting and Author# Zechariah 1:1a In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,… This is Darius I (Darius the Great) son of Darius Hystaspes who reigned from 29th of September 522 b.C. to October 486 b.C..# The dating given is according to a Gentile king. This is because no Jewish king is reigning and the \u0026ldquo;Times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo; is underway. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24, Mark 13:14# The first message of four of the book was written in the eighth month of 520 b.C. The second message was written three months later. The third message was written in 518 b.C.. Zechariah 1:1, 7, 7:1# No dating is given for the fourth message found in chapters 9 through 14 but it appears to have been written at a later date and under different circumstances.# The whole book is written from and is regarding the city of Jerusalem in the present and into the far future.# Chapters 1-8 Jerusalem under Medo-Persian rule (586-332 b.C.)# Chapters 9-10 Jerusalem governed by Greece (332-63 b.C.)# Chapter 11 Jerusalem under Roman domination (63 b.C.-70 A.D.f)# Chapters 12 to 14 Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s last days of national history# The future promises for Israel contained in this short book serve to provide a record throughout the ages as encouragement to Israel to return to Yahweh Shabaot. Every generation of Jew for over 2500 years has had, in the record of Zechariah, a faithful testimony of Yahweh interacting with her throughout the ages to bring about her yet future return.# One day, in the not so distant future, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s book will find it\u0026rsquo;s total fulfillment in a literal way so that \u0026ldquo;all will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo;.# Zechariah 1:1b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,… It was the word of the Lord, not Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s imagined word for the Lord.# Zechariah was a levite, born in Babylon. His name means \u0026ldquo;Yahweh remembers\u0026rdquo;. Nehemiah 12:1, 16# Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah was both prophet and priest.# Zechariah evidently survived Joshua the high priest and became a head of his own division of priests during the time of Joiakim, the son of Joshua. Nehemiah 12:12, 16# In the beginning of his ministry, Zechariah was probably a young man and was born in Babylon. Zechariah 2:4# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s contemporary, Haggai, began his ministry in September of 520 b.C..While Haggai\u0026rsquo;s focus was to return and rebuild the temple, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy complemented his ministry focusing on a spiritual return to the Lord.# While Haggai\u0026rsquo;s focus is more on things past and present, the message given to Zechariah will reach far into the future, relating to the returning generation of a wonderfully restored Jewish nation back in fellowship with Almighty God.# According to some ancient versions, Zechariah was also a poet. His name is in the titles of:# Psalm 137, 145— 50 in the LXX [Septuagint]# Psalm 111, 145 in the Vulgate;# Psalm 125, 145—48 in the Syriac.\u0026quot; 3# 515b.C. Note: This Psalm [145 in LXX / 146 in Massoretic], and the four following, which end the book, are supposed to have been sung at the dedication of the second temple\u0026hellip; 4# Chapters 9 and 10 are written in poetic form.# Zechariah 1:1c the son of Berechiah,… Berechiah was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s father. Not much is known about Berechiah except that his name means \u0026ldquo;Yahweh blesses\u0026rdquo;. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra among the returnees.# Jesus makes a statement about Zechariah, Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s son, being martyred. Matthew 23:35# Scholars disagree on this verse. There are differeing opinions regarding how it should be understood.# Option 1: Jehoiada means the same as Berechiah. There was another prophet Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was martyred. Since both father\u0026rsquo;s names essentially mean the same thing, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus. 2 Chronicles 24:20-22# Option 2: A copyist error. Some suggest it could be a copyists\u0026rsquo;s error in the transcription of the Greek text.# Option 3: Though this tragedy was done in secret, Jesus confesses having witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder, just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s, which was also done in secret. This seems the most plausible option of the three.# If this is true, and we believe it is, it is not recorded anywhere in Scripture. That however, does not make it false.# Matthew seemed familiar with the book of Zechariah since he quotes it at least three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus mention this event so he quotes Jesus precisely where the other Gospel writers do not.# In the context of Matthew, Jesus seems to be aluding to the first and last of the righteous prophets of the Old Testament. To say that Zechariah son of Jehoiada was the last would excluse many prophets (including Zechariah) as righteous.# God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He sees all that is done in public as well as in secret. Ultimately he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20# The Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also states that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. These rabbis would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus.# Zechariah 1:1d the son of Iddo… Iddo is Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. His name means \u0026ldquo;appointed time\u0026rdquo;.# Iddo was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 12:4, 12:16# Zechariah is also referred to as the son of Iddo. This is common practice to say his forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14# Ezra mentiones the prophet Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo together. Perhaps the role of priest is what Ezra is bringing out.# Together, the names Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time\u0026rdquo;. The harmonizes wonderfully with the message of the book. When the appointed time comes, God will fulfill all His promises and they will be carried out with overflowing blessing.# Zechariah 1:2-3 The great appeal, \u0026ldquo;return to Me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 1:2a \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers.… the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36# The pre-exilic fathers are used as an example of what not to do. It was their refusing to respond that send the nation into exile for 70 years.# Zechariah 1:2b \u0026hellip;Very angry the Text literally says angry with anger.# Zechariah 1:3b \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them Thus says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s primary audience are the people who have returned from exile in Babylon. Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo; word to the people.# This would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua.# What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God\u0026rsquo;s word. Hebrews 1:1, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:20-21# When God speaks something, He is tied to His Word to fulfill it. Ezra 1:1, Proverbs 30:5, Hebrews 6:17-18,# Who is The LORD OF HOSTS (Yahweh Saboath)?# In Hebrew it is Yahweh Sabaoth or Almighty of armies. It appears 235 times in the Bible# The first time this name of God appears in the Bible is in 1 Samuel when the people of Israel were concerned about armies, particularly the Philistine armies. The name appears often in prophetical books.# The Lord of Hosts is mentioned no less than 53 times in Zechariah. Therefore, in order to better understand the book of Zechariah we should get better acquainted with this name of God. Luke 2:13, Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53# The Lord of Hosts is the Commander of Armies# Isaiah 13:4 \u0026hellip;is mustering the army for battle. Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3, 1 Kings 22:19# Isaiah 19:16 \u0026hellip;Awake to punish all the nations\u0026hellip; Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7# Nahum 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am against you,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.\u0026rdquo; Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matthew 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20# David was familiar with the meaning of the Lord of hosts. He invoked the Lord of Hosts when going to battle with Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10# Though David took off Saul\u0026rsquo;s armor, he put on the Lord of Hosts. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27# The Lord of Hosts is the King:# Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19, 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14# Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# The Lord of Hosts is The Redeemer:# Isaiah 47:4 Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS\u0026hellip;# Isaiah 44:6 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5# The Lord of Hosts is Holy:# Isaiah 6:3 \u0026ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16# The Lord of Hosts is Almighty:# Daniel 4:35 \u0026ldquo;All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN \u0026amp; among the inhabitants of earth \u0026amp; no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, \u0026lsquo;What have You done?\u0026rdquo;# The Lord of Hosts and the Davidic Covenant\u0026hellip;# 2 Samuel 7:27 \u0026ldquo;For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to Your servant, saying, \u0026lsquo;I will build you a house\u0026rsquo;;\u0026hellip;# It is the Lord of Hosts who will ultimately will never allow injustice to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8# When Christ is seated on His throne , He will be called the Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16-17# As the prophets used this title, they stressed Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty in action, not just in its abstract meaning. That is, they saw Yahweh Sabaoth as leading all armies—armies of stars, angels, and people.# Zechariah lived when Israel had lost its army, had no military power, had little political organization, and no political power. Thus, by referring to Yahweh as \u0026ldquo;the LORD of armies,\u0026rdquo; Zechariah was reminding his hearers of their God\u0026rsquo;s abiding and active sovereignty.1# God is the Lord of the stars, the powers of heaven, and all the forces of the universe - a most inclusive and comprehensive name for God. 5# The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in the aspect of God that God stressed in revealing Himself to His people through its writer. Zechariah used the name Yahweh Sabaoth more than any other book of the Bible.# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message comes directly from the Lord of hosts himself\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;thus says the Lord of hosts\u0026rdquo; Psalm 84:1-12# Zechariah 1:3c \u0026ldquo;Thus says the Lord of hosts\u0026hellip;Return to Me,\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The Lord of hosts\u0026hellip;the Lord Almighty, Lord of the armies, says this\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;come back to Me\u0026rdquo;.# While Haggai is more focused on the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message is to encourage the people to return into right relationship with God.# They had come back from exile, but they needed to turn fully and trustingly to the Lord. 5# Some are offended at the idea that God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty would be affected if man had any say in the matter. Yet clearly in this circumstance we have the Lord of Hosts Himself inviting His nation to willingly \u0026ldquo;return to Me\u0026rdquo;. It would be hypocritical of God to call to a return and force them to do so.# God sovereignly chooses to limit Himself sovereignly allows man to respond to His invitation at will. God is looking for free responses, not forced gestures.# God makes the invitation and leaves it up to man to respond. He does not invite until man responds, but he makes it a point to draw all to Himself. John 12:32, 48# Zechariah tells us is that God is faithful to His word. He will hold back the wonderful promises made to Israel until she returns in belief. Romans 11:23, Zechariah 12:10# All of God\u0026rsquo;s promises to withhold blessings will be kept.# All of God\u0026rsquo;s promises to return to them when they return to Him will also be kept.# In the meantime, God protects Israel from annihilation (you can\u0026rsquo;t keep a promise to a nation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist), keeping the gentiel nations at bay until that wondrous day when she returns to Him with all her heart.# Romans 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!# The returning Jews needed to understand that merely returning to the land, reinhabitting Jerusalem, rebuilding the temple is not synonymous with placing their confidence in the Lord of Hosts. 1 John 3:3# Zephaniah 3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!# Zephaniah 3:2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.# The opposite of returning is to forsake. When they didn\u0026rsquo;t trust the Lord, they were completely forsaking the Lord of hosts. They kept the law in part and placed their trust in idolatry, wealth and even their religious form. Not trusting the Lord and serving other gods is called \u0026ldquo;doing evil\u0026rdquo;. Deuteronomy 4:25, 17:2-5# Zechariah 1:3d declares the LORD of hosts,… This is a declaration from the Lord. It is probable Zechariah preached this message to all the people.# One might think this exhortation is really uncalled for at a time like this. The people had just gone through a time of discipline where God took them away from the land into a strange land to live among a strange, pagan people who did not have the same practices and customs as they did.# Surely they didn\u0026rsquo;t need exhorting to return to the Lord? The Lord seemed to think they did. That was enough for Zechariah and it should be enough for us when we are exhorted by the Lord.# A new generation was now coming back to the land, They had left their exilic homes, and reistablished the daily sacrifices. The foundation for the temple was even laid. Things were seemingly going well, Did the prophet not understand how much they had already sacrificed? Wasn\u0026rsquo;t God pleased with them?# God is more interested for their hearts to be tuned to Him, instead of all their hard efforts for Him. The Jews needed first of all to return to Him spiritually. This vital aspect of their return was totally overlooked and taken for granted due to the circumstances.# When the trials of the building project come their way, they were quickly discouraged and frustrated. They had not been trusting the Lord of hosts for His daily spiritual provision in their lives, how could they trust God for the rebuilding of the temple? Haggai 1:9-11# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side but even greater, is to have him with you.# The tabernacle in the middle of the nation was to serve as a reminder of God\u0026rsquo;s presence among the people.# The Lord is not just saying \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to bless you\u0026rdquo;, He\u0026rsquo;s essentially saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to dwell with you\u0026rdquo;. I will cohabit with you. I will share my heart with you. Exodus 25:8, Exodus 29:46, 2 Corinthians 6:6# In the Church age, God enters (indwells) the believer through the Person of the Holy Spirit. Yet it is only as we turn to Him or rather, in New Testament vernacular, walk with Him by faith that He richly dwells in us. Acts 17:24, Ephesians 3:17, Colossians 3:16# In the Millenial age, all of Israel will be given hearts that love God and God dwells in the midst of His people. 2 Corinthians 6:16, Ezekiel 36:26# Zechariah 1:4-6 Their fathers returned but never returned to the Lord# In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will clarify what \u0026ldquo;return to Me\u0026rdquo; does not not mean.# Zechariah 1:4a \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers,… Look to your fathers\u0026rsquo; example, don\u0026rsquo;t follow in their footsteps, do not follow their example. 2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8# Zechariah 1:4b to whom the former prophets proclaimed,… God had spoken to them through the prophets. In fact, they had been warned countless times and in countless ways.# The former prophets include; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10# Zechariah 1:4c saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now\u0026hellip;(to Me) Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10# It was not the Lord that needed to return to them first, it was the people that had departed from the Lord and needed to realize their state, change their minds and return to Him.# This is not simply to a formal obedience to His law and covenant. Zechariah was to warn the Israelites not to be like their (pre-exilic) forefathers who refused to respond to the preaching of earlier (pre-exilic) prophets.# This is not saying if Israel would have ceased from sinning, God would have returned. A return to God is not synonymous with sinning less as some teach.# A return meant coming to God without delay on the basis of who He is and His promised Provision for sin\u0026rsquo;s atonement in the coming Messiah.# Zechariah 1:4c \u0026hellip;from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026quot;\u0026rsquo;… The fathers, just like Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation, needed to change their minds away from what they trusted in, towards God. Acts 20:21# Zechariah 1:4d *..evil ways and from evil deeds\u0026hellip;*The evidence is conclusive. Their ways and deeds demonstrated the condition of their wayward hearts. Ezekiel 14:5,# This may sound like the Lord is saying to stop their evil ways and evil deeds. They should, but that is not the point here.# The point is to convince the people their ways and deeds were a result of a bad relationship with God. Jeremiah 2:13# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s admonishment to his generation is that they learn from the bad example of their forefathers and listen to what the Lord had to say and return to Him. Jeremiah 29:13, Proverbs 3:5, 1 Samuel 12:24# The message contained in this book is intended to do exactly that to the returnees. This is true of subsequent generations as well.# Zechariah 1:4d But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.… The real issue resided in the hearts. They did not listen\u0026hellip;Isaiah 6:10# They were unable to hear God speaking because they didn\u0026rsquo;t listen. They were rebellious and refused to heed the many warnings. Jeremiah 17:23, 29:19, 35:17, 44:5# Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place. A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil things but a return to fellowship.# A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 2 Chronicles 12:14# God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27, Colossians 2:23# God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4# It is counted as violence to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4# In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. Jeremiah 10:2, Acts 28:3-4, Acts 17:23# This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. They arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be rebuilt . Haggai 1:2# Once again, God disciplined them, this time with a drought yet they still did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17# Zechariah 1:5a \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they?… While a small group of them returned, the fathers for the most part had been killed by the Babylonians and died off or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10# Zechariah 1:5b And the prophets, do they live forever?… The prophets were human too and eventually died. Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to.# God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today,# God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvation is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2# Zechariah 1:6a \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,… God raised up prophets to speak His words and His statutes were written down so there would be no mistaking what God said.# *My words\u0026hellip;*The prophet who spoke presumptuously without the Lord commanding Him should not be feared. Deuteronomy 18:18-22, Jeremiah 28:15-17, Deuteronomy 13:5# *My statues\u0026hellip;*These were taught and written down. Israel was not to add or take away from them. Deuteronomy 4:1-2, 8# Zechariah 1:6b overtake your fathers?… The words spoken through His servants and the established statutes came to pass as God had said they would. Deuteronomy 28:45# Zechariah 1:6c \u0026hellip;and they returned and said\u0026hellip; (KJV) the word returned (SHUB) is correctly translated \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; in the King James version, and not as the New American Standard Version. It\u0026rsquo;s referring to a physical return from Babylon to the land. Compare the use of SHUB in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6# Zechariah 1:6d As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.… The forefathers served to testify of the veracity of God\u0026rsquo;s word. Their witness is clear, God did as He said He would do. Lamentations 1:18, 2:7# The first temple was destroyed in 586b.C. and the second temple was finished in 516b.C., a gap of 70 years.# The first deportation was in 605b.C. while the first return occured in 536b.C., a 70 year gap.# The returnees were now hearing the word of the Lord through the Prophets Haggai and Zechariah. The statutes continued to speak the same and now the forefathers testimony as well, gave credence to the importance of heeding the message.# 42,360 people returned to Judah on this first wave, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers. Included in this group were members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2, Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70# Though a group returned physically, their focus was on the land, the temple and on material blessings. Blessings removed and curses received. Yet they never repented, they never changed their minds from trusting themselves to trusting God.# Jeremiah 7:4 \u0026ldquo;Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, \u0026lsquo;This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; Jeremiah 7:8# This has been referred to as “walking at a guilty distance.” This is not what it means to walk with God. Genesis 6:9# A note about biblical repentance# The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel.# In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe based his translation on Jerome\u0026rsquo;s Latin Bible as his sole source. The Latin vulgate unfortunately had several grave mistranslations, including the Greek word METANOIA (to change one\u0026rsquo;s thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent.# The doctrine of penance was what was being taught by the Roman Church, which required the sinner paying a certain penance in order to be forgiven.# The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel profound sorrow, be penitent) replaced the original Greek word metanoia (change your mind).# We can understand then why sometimes the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, \u0026lsquo;return\u0026rsquo;. Physically they returned. Spiritually they did not.# In this case, the fathers recognized being wrong and that God was punishing them for disobedience. They readily accepted the consequences of their sin (punishment).# Yet they never looked to God. They recognized God as sovereign and the punishment they deserved but their trust was never placed in the Lord. They trusted in fate. Their hope was that God somehow might show mercy on them despite their wrong doings.# This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized.# As the believer fellowships with God, God brings certain things (sin) to light which the believer should confess it to (agree with) God. Yet the basis for fellowship is not confession.# Confession does not access or maintain fellowship, faith does. Confession is what results of repentance (a change of mind) while walking by faith in fellowship with God. He who says he has no sin\u0026hellip;lies and is not fellowshipping with God. 1 John 1# If one has to confess to get back into fellowship with God, the waters of grace are muddied. It is displaced suficiency of Christ onto the actions of the believer.# More to the point, the people who came to John the Baptist confessing their sin, were believers who were responding to the preaching of repentance. John\u0026rsquo;s baptism was an appropriate response of what God was doing in the hearts of the people through John\u0026rsquo;s message. Mark 1:1-4, Matthew 3:7-8# In like manner, the believer is to confess his sins because his sins have been forgiven. It is not for forgiveness that he confesses, but because he accepts by faith he already has forgiveness. This is aligning, saying the same, to what God says in His word.# Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for all sin not merely for sins that are confessed. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has fully paid for his sin debt (past, present, future) and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God.# If a believer sins, a return to God (a believer who repents) is one who comes to God on the basis of who Christ is and his standing in Christ by faith and thereby providing acceptance before the Father. No amount of confession of sin makes the sinner more or less acceptable before the Father. That was Christ\u0026rsquo;s work. Colossians 2:6# The Jewish forefathers needed approach God by faith. Merely admitting sin and accepting the consequences as from God, is not the same as approaching God by faith which requires resting in God\u0026rsquo;s provision. Ezekiel 20:43# We find a stark contrast between the fathers and Daniel\u0026rsquo;s response when he read the prophecy of Jeremiah regarding the 70 year exile. Daniel 9:15-19# Biblical repentance is not merely admiting you\u0026rsquo;re guilty, it\u0026rsquo;s trusting God\u0026rsquo;s solution. Matthew 27:3-5# Biblical repentace is not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. In fact, the Bible used two very different words for repent and sorrow.# It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow can lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing, one leads to the other. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9# Biblical repentance is not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found anywhere in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven is a promised result of repentance.# Biblical repentance not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic. This is a common misconception that still plagues Christianity today.# The root is a change of mind which is internal. The results may or may not be outward and could be evidenced differently in each case but are not a requirement by God for the internal to be considered authentic. Luke 3:8-18# Salvation is by faith in the Gospel. Salvation is not by works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9# Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God. You change your thinking from what you were trusting in to trust God alone. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1# In the case of an unbeliever, he or she must change their mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5# Or a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16# The purpose of this message was that God was warning the returning Jews that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not trust Him.# They would be prone to imagine the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and return to Him by faith. Yet the fathers did not.# Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, \u0026ldquo;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote# Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.\u0026rdquo;# Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, \u0026ldquo;Who sees us?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Who knows us?\u0026rdquo; You turn things around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, \u0026ldquo;He did not make me\u0026rdquo;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, \u0026ldquo;He has no understanding\u0026rdquo;?# James 4:8 “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”. NKJV# Following are some examples from the people that Zechariah brings out throughout the book to demonstrate bad believing and their need to change their minds\u0026hellip;# The busy returnees - for about 16 years the people stood by and concluded \u0026ldquo;it was not God\u0026rsquo;s will\u0026rdquo; to rebuild the temple. They each went to building their elaborate homes. Haggai 1:2, 4, 8# The unlistening fathers - This lot persisted playing deaf with God and got deported. Zechariah 1:4-6# The unmoved exiles - The jews who remained in comfort, remaining dispersed in foreign nations. Zechariah 2# The soiled high priest - The priestly garments (ie Joshua\u0026rsquo;s) was soiled. Satan didn\u0026rsquo;t need any other incriminated evidence to bring a charge against God\u0026rsquo;s elect. Clearly, they were guilty. Zechariah 3# The temple whiners - Since the second temple was not as grand as the first, they scorned the building of the second temple. Large or small, when God asks you to get involved it\u0026rsquo;s a grand thing! Zechariah 4# Wickedness in the land - wickedness will have to be removed, why would God have to remove wickedness from the land of a people that \u0026ldquo;deserved\u0026rdquo; God\u0026rsquo;s blessings? Zechariah 5# The redundant mourners - This lot mourned about their losses, only to forget the reason why they lost them in the first place. Zechariah 7-8# The Good Shepherd rejectors - God provided a Shepherd for Israel. He was caring, compassionate and protective of the flock, yet they rejected Him. Zechariah 9# The fleecing shepherds - The people tolerated shepherds who used them for financial gain. Zechariah 11:1-5# Dishonest merchants - These returnees learned Babylonian ways. They used lying and swearing to secure business.# The foolish shepherd followers - The people readily embraced a foolish Shepherd who didn\u0026rsquo;t care about them and didn\u0026rsquo;t protect them. Instead they were slaughtered. Zechariah 11:15-17# Those who pierced the Deliverer - The infamous nation who killed their liberator.# These illustrations serve to cause reflective consideration regarding the people\u0026rsquo;s true spiritual condition. Would they see their utter need and return to Yahweh or continue on the same path as their fathers?# Zechariah 1:7-6:8 - The Second Message: Eight Visions# Three months later, Zechariah received 8 visions in one night. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some parts were fulfilled within the near future but most of the prophecies contained in the visions have yet to be fulfilled even today.# These night visions serve the primary purpose of revealing to the people, God\u0026rsquo;s involvement behind the scenes to make Israel and Judah\u0026rsquo;s return to Him a reality. All of these visions deal with God\u0026rsquo;s nation, Israel and not generally speaking of God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo;.# These visions serve to encourage the people of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time to finish building the temple. The temple is important for so many reasons within the existence of the Jews but a key reason is so that prophecy regarding Messiah might be fulfilled.# They also serve to give hope to future generations as the visions unveil how God is compassionately and faithfully fighting for Israel and of His plans to make Israel the epicenter of the world.# We will try not to discifer every detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know.# Each of the visions follow a similar pattern.# Zechariah describes what he saw# Zechariah enquires what it means# Zechariah is given the significance# Passage Vision Meaning 1 Zechariah 1:7-17 The horseman God is jealous for Israel. God is prepared to fight the nations for Israel\u0026rsquo;s restoration and bring justice and through it, world peace. 2 Zechariah 1:18-21 4 horns and 4 craftsmen The nations who have scattered Israel will be thrown down. 3 Zechariah 2:1-13 Measuring Jerusalem Jerusalem will be restored 4 Zechariah 3:1-10 Joshua high priest Though Israel (particularly the priesthood) has not walked as they should, God will one day restore Israel. 5 Zechariah 4:1-14 The lampstand God empowers his people through His Spirit. 6 Zechariah 5:1-4 The flying scroll Righteous judgement; first on God\u0026rsquo;s people, then on the nations of the world. 7 Zechariah 5:5-11 The ephah Wickedness removed. 8 Zechariah 6:1-15 Four chariots God\u0026rsquo;s kingdom is established with Messiah as King of the earth. A Crown fit for The King Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the horseman# Zechariah 1:7-8 The Vision# Zechariah 1:7a On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, Three months after receiving the first message, Zechariah receives a second communication from the Lord.# Zechariah 1:7b which is the month Shebat, Since Zechariah lives in a Persian/Babylonian/Hebrew culture, he gives the Aramaic month name as well. Shebat is the adapted Babylonian name for the eleventh month.# This is January-February, the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel.# Zechariah 1:7c in the second year of Darius, Though Medo-Persia had years of trouble after Cyrus died, by his second year, Darius managed to bring the empire to stability and peace.# \u0026ldquo;Darius boasted that in nineteen battles he had defeated nine rebel leaders and had subdued all his enemies. So the empire was again virtually quiet by 520 B.C.\u0026rdquo;6# Zechariah 1:7d the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah,the son of Iddo, again, Zechariah gives his credentials. This may have been because these were separate messages that were later compiled into one book of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecies.# This day (24 Shebat) marked 5 months since the rebuilding of the temple had begun. Haggai 1:14-15, 2:10, 18, 20# Zechariah 1:7-8a \u0026hellip;as follows: I saw at night, This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of visions in the night.# This was not a dream. Zechariah was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was how God many times communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6# Zechariah 1:8b and behold, a man was riding\u0026hellip;This man is the only rider mentioned and appears to take a more prominent role.# Who is this rider? We are later told he is the angel of the Lord. We will discuss this later in verse 11.# Zechariah 1:8c \u0026hellip;on a red horse, we cannot be dogmatic since the the angel does not say, but generally speaking red symbolizes bloodshed, many times as a result of war.# Horses then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in the context of war. Cavalry was highly regarded by many civilizations during this time.# In Revelation 6:4 we also see a red horse who comes to take peace and cause war and bloodshed.# Zechariah 1:8d and he was standing among the myrtle trees It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees.# Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther\u0026rsquo;s Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7# Myrtle branches are used during the celebration of the Feast of Booths. Nehemiah 8:15, Isaiah 41:19, 55:13# In the Millenial age, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19# Zechariah 1:8e which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Red, sorrel and white horses behind him.# These horses probably symbolize angelic beings as they were God\u0026rsquo;s representatives sent to \u0026ldquo;patrol the earth\u0026rdquo;.# Persian monarchs used messengers on swift steeds to keep them informed on all matters concerning their empire. 7# Zechariah 1:9a The Question# Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know the what it was that he saw.# Zechariah 1:9b-17 The Interpretation# Zechariah 1:9b And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor\u0026rsquo;s task to guess what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1# Zechariah 1:10a And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, The man standing enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 1:10b \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; The horses here most likely represent angelic beings sent by the Lord.# This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7# We know from Job 1:6-7 that angelic beings are roaming the earth.# Zechariah 1:11a So they answered the angel of the LORD This is the first mention of \u0026ldquo;the angel of the Lord\u0026rdquo; in Zechariah.# The angel of the LORD can be seen about 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article the helps identify He is a singular being.# The only adequate interpretation for this being as seen here as well as other portions of Scripture, is that it is referring to the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus Christ.# The angel of the Lord was the Lord Himself, the second person of the Trinity.# This “man among the myrtle trees” appears to be the same as the angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13).# The Angel of the Lord shows up six times in Zechariah. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8# The angel of the Lord had an intercessory role throughout the Old Testament. Zechariah 1:12, 12:8, Exodus 14:19; 33:14; Isaiah 13:9; 1 Corinthians 10:4# The angel of the Lord removed Joshua the priest\u0026rsquo;s filthy garments and gave him new clothes symbolizing the preparation for temple service before the Lord.# The angel of the Lord is Yahweh but shown distinct from Yahweh in other passages. The following Scriptures illustrate how the writers showed the angel of the Lord to be Yahweh but yet distinct from Yahweh. 2 Samuel 24:16; Zechariah 1:12# He gives comfort to Hagar. Genesis 16:7, 11# He calls Moses. The angel of the Lord is Yahweh. Exodus 3:1-6# He stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. Genesis 22:11-12, 15-16# To talk sense to Balaam. Numbers 22:31, 35, 38# To prepare Gideon for battle. Judges 6:12-13, 22# David was terrified by His sword. 1 Chronicles 21:18, 27, 30# Geneis 3:15 tells us that God will raise up a deliverer, who is to be a man, born of the woman who will crush Satan.# Zechariah reveals to us something more about the angel of the Lord.# He mentions twice in this passage that He is a man. Zechariah 1:8, 10# He removes iniquity. Zechariah 3:1, 4# Did Zechariah see Jesus in the future? Or perhaps he actually saw the angel of the Lord before he put on humanity but was identifying# Zechariah states twice that the angel of the Lord is a standing. Zechariah 1:8, 10# Stephen saw Jesus standing when he was being stoned. Acts 7:55-56# Jesus is seen standing when he receives the scroll in Heaven. Revelation 5:6# Jesus will be seen standing on mount Zion when He returns. Revelation 14:1# We therefore conclude that according to Zechariah and supportive Scriptures that the identity of the Angel of the Lord (capitalized from now on) is God the son, the second person of the Trinity.# The book of Zechariah presents Christ as:# The Angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:11# The man. Zechariah 1:10, 1:11, 13:7# The Branch. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12# God\u0026rsquo;s Associate. Zechariah 13:7# The Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7# Priest. Zechariah 6:13# The King. Zechariah 9:9, 14:16, Isaiah 6:5, John 12:41# The Redeemer. Zechariah# God\u0026rsquo;s Servant. Zechariah 3:8# The Stone. Zechariah 3:7# Lord of the whole earth.

Zechariah 13:7# Genesis 3:15 - A male seed of the woman, Matthew 1:23, Galatians 4:4# John 1:14 - The eternal God put on humanity. He was fully God and fully human. Revelation 22:13, 16# Christ was interceding on behalf of Israel before he became a man. He didn\u0026rsquo;t need to put on humanity to intercede. He had to put on humanity to pay man\u0026rsquo;s sin debt and become a substitute.\nThe Angel of the Lord who will one day destroy the nations that go up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8# Zechariah 1:11b They answered the man \u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, These horses went to gather intel regarding the current political climate of the earth.# Obviously the horses symbolize something. We are not told if they have riders, nor what their colours mean.\nZechariah 1:11c and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; In the second year of Darius there prevailed universal peace; all the nations of the earlier Chaldaean empire were at rest, and lived in undisturbed prosperity. 8# Peaceful (YASHAB) is to dwell or settle at ease. Genesis 20:15, Genesis 25:27# Quiet (SHAQAT) describes a state of undisturbed tranquility. It is a condition during the absence of war. Judges 3:30# To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026ldquo;Peace at last, All is well!\u0026rdquo;. However this report is not received well by the Angel of the Lord.# Zechariah 1:12a Then the Angel of the LORD said, Instead of the interpreting angel answering Zechariah, the angel of the Lord asks a question to the Lord of hosts.# Zechariah 1:12b \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, The Angel of the Lord addresses the Lord of hosts, asking the duration of the discipline on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. Jeremiah 25:11-12# We are reminded of Habakuk\u0026rsquo;s cry to the Lord before Judah was taken into exile\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;How long, Lord, have I called for help, And You do not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save.\u0026rdquo;# The Gentile nations were at peace at the expense of violence done to God\u0026rsquo;s nation Israel.# There is sense of total indifference on behalf of the nations towards Israel\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty. Nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to posess their land within the quiet peace at the time.# Even today, Israel is treated with contempt.# The only reason the Lord allows it to play out is because God desires Israel to return to Him. So as long as Israel is in a state of unbelief, we can expect the absence of peace for the land of Israel.# There is a difference between the kind of peaceful silence the world was experiencing at that time and the peace (SHALOM) which Messiah will bring in.# SHALOM comes from the rood word SHALAM.# In the translation of Exodus 21-22, SHALAM is translated as “make it good”, “shall surely pay”, “make full restitution” or to “restore”. The ancient Hebrew meaning of SHALAM was “to make something whole”. Not just regarding practical restoration of things that were lost or stolen. But with an overall sense of fulness and completeness in mind, body and estate. 9# Genesis 43:27-28 “Then he asked them about their well-being [SHALOM], and said, “Is your father well [SHALOM], the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” And they answered, “Your servant our father is in good health [SHALOM]; he is still alive.” NKJV# Messiah will bring in shalom between the offices of priest and king. Zechariah 6:13# Messiah will bring shalom to the land. Zechariah 8:12# Messiah will speak shalom to the nations. Zechariah 9:10# Messiah\u0026rsquo;s name will be prince of shalom. Isaiah 9:6-7# True, world shalom will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne in Jerusalem. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4# World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deaded her, Babylon is utterly destroyed and the Prince of Peace is reigning on His throne in Jerusalem. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5# Zechariah 1:12b \u0026hellip;with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; God is shown to be in control of Israel\u0026rsquo;s time, not the Gentile nations. God had said the time would be 70 years.# The Angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s words reflect his compassion for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026ldquo;at peace\u0026rdquo;.# The Angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s part here perfectly anticipates Jesus\u0026rsquo; role as Intercessor for His people.# Zechariah 1:13 The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. We are told the sovereign Lord of the universe responds with kind, comforting words, but we\u0026rsquo;re not told what those words were. Colossians 4:6# Psalm 94:19 When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations delight my soul.# Isaias 35:4 Say to those with anxious heart, \u0026ldquo;Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 1:14a So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, Just like the first message, this message was not to be kept hidden, it was to be proclaimed to the people.# As a prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2# So, this is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12# Zechariah 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous\u0026hellip; The Lord reminds his people \u0026ldquo;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!\u0026rdquo; God has a strong devotion towards his posession, Israel. Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7# His disposition goes beyond what we hear when it is said, \u0026ldquo;God has a plan for you, he wants to bless you\u0026rdquo;. We must realize that God is jealously seeking his posession unto himself to not share with anyone or anything else. God is willing to go to great lengths, even to war against the nations because he desires a people unto himself.# This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seemed God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel.# Zechariah 1:14c for Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture we see Zion used synonimously with Jerusalem. Here Zion should be understood as even more specific.# The earth is at the center of creation. Israel is the central nation of the world. Jerusalem is the central city in Israel. Zion is the mountain in Jerusalem where the temple will be built. Micah 3:12# The term, Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Micah 4:1# Zion is the mountain on which Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6# Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Micah 4:2# Zion can also refer to God\u0026rsquo;s people. Zechariah 2:7, 2:10# Zechariah 1:15a \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; The nations were at ease with the current circumstances of Israel.# The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not posess her land. They have done nothing but oppress Israel.# Zechariah 1:15b for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; God was angry with the fathers but now the nations have angered God even more. Zechariah 1:2# Israel\u0026rsquo;s exile a disaster because it was unnecessary. Yet the response of the nations made the calamity even worse.# The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent peace and requests to know how much longer the status quo would be permitted to go on.# The Lord had warned the nations (especially in the case the Chaldeans) they would be judged for the way they treated of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34-35, Amos 6:1# Zechariah 1:16a \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; Because of the injustice by the Gentile nations, God will symbolically return his presence to Jerusalem with compassion.# Zechariah 1:16b My house will be built in it\u0026hellip; the rebuilding of the temple is foretold here. The temple will be completed.# Temples in the Bible# Temple Timeframe 1 1st - Solomon\u0026rsquo;s 958b.C. - 586b.C. 2 2nd - Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s 515b.C.-70a.D. 3 Mount Gerizim (Samaritans) 450b.C.-110b.C. 4 3rd - Tribulation temple Near end of tribulation 5 4th - The Messiah\u0026rsquo;s Temple Millenium - New Jerusalem House or temple (BAYITH) appears 31 times in Zechariah.# It can refer to a physical building.# God\u0026rsquo;s Temple. Zechariah 1:16, 3:7, 4:9, 7:3, 8:9, 11:13, 14:20, 14:21# The temple in Shinar. Zechariah 5:11# A dwelling for a person. Zechariah 6:10, 14:2# It can refer to a family or people. For instance, the house of Judah or the house of Israel. Zechariah 8:13, 8:15, 8:19, 10:3, 10:6, 12:4, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:12, 12:13, 13:1# It can refer to a religious system. Zechariah 7:3, 13:6, 5:4# Zechariah 1:16c declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; the rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been astounding to hear especially while the city lied ruins.# About 200 years earlier, God had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would raise up someone to deliver them from Babylon and Jerusalem would be built.# Isaiah 44:28 It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; .# Zechariah adds to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be finished. Zechariah 4:9-10# Zechariah 1:17a \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion. Psalm 132:13# The Lord of hosts promises overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15# While the prophecy of verse 16 finds its fulfilment in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.# Overflowing prosperity in the land and the Lord comforting Zion will come about after Israel returns to the Lord. Zechariah 13:9# Zechariah 1:17 and again choose Jerusalem\u0026hellip; God will once again place his attention on Jerusalem. Zechariah 2:12, 8:8, 13:9# What does it mean to once again choose Jerusalem?# 70 years prior, God removed the people from the land. They were exiled to a foreign land. There was no mention of Jerusalem as God had intended her.# Though the priests garments soil their garments, though Israel was unfaithful, the nation continued to be God\u0026rsquo;s chosen vessel. Zechariah 3:2# God sovereignly chose the nation of Israel for the purpose of carrying out his redemptive plan for humanity and earthly restoration. 2 Chronicles 6:6# Zechariah 1:18-21 A Vision of four horns \u0026amp; four craftsmen# Zechariah 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Zechariah became suddenly aware of four horns.# Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. In verse 21 we see it was nations lifted up their horns against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17# Zechariah 1:19a So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah did not readily understand what the meaning of what he saw.# He saw horns but he realized they simbolize something. He asks the interpreting angel what they are.# Zechariah 1:19b And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; These horns (typically powers or empires) are identified as having scattered the people.# Differing opinion exist as to the identity of the horns.# Option 1: Nations in the past. Assyria, Egypt, Babylonia, and Medo-Persia—are in view here.# Option 2: The 4 empires of the Times of the Gentiles mentioned in Daniel. Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that oppress Israel. Ezekiel 34:11-31# The second option seems best although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s prophecy would probably associate these 4 horns with Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome.# The identity of the horns is not stated\u0026hellip;yet they clearly portray total domination of the people of Israel by the powers that attacked and conquered them. 10# Zechariah 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah needed to know what the 4 horns were. When he sees the craftsmen coming, he asks what they would do.# A craftsman is a skillful artisan. He is known by what he does with his hands. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31# Zechariah 1:21b And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head; through oppression, sorrow, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15# This was Judah\u0026rsquo;s current condition even though they were allowed back into the land. They still lived under the domination of Medo-Persia at the time.# Jersusalem will be trampled underfoot until the end of the \u0026ldquo;Times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo;.# Zechariah 1:21c but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, The artisans come to cause these nations to shudder.# Zechariah 1:21d to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; The enemy nations will be dealt with accordinly. Jeremiah 50:45-46# to throw down - is one word in Hebrew (YADAW) meaning to cast out. Just like these nations caused Judah to be sent away, so too these craftmen come to cast these nations away.# Even though the horns had scattered Judah, God told Zechariah the four craftsmen who would come to throw them down.# Some suggest these craftsmen are the very successors to the horns. For instance, the first crafsman would be Medo-Persia casting out Babylon.# The final craftsman in this case would be none other than Messiah himself who comes and casts out the last of the four horns.# This vision served to encourage Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord ultimately had the stronger hand over the nations.# Zechariah 2:1-13 A vision of measuring Jerusalem# Zechariah 2:1a Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold\u0026hellip; No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a man who had an# Zechariah 2:1b \u0026hellip;there was a man with a a measuring line in his hand. Though not the angel of the Lord, there is a similar angel with the form of a man in Ezekiel 40:3; 41; 42; in another connection it is seen in Revelation 11:1-2# Zechariah 2:2a So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Interestingly, the vision is such that Zechariah interacts with the person in the vision.# Zechariah was puzzled as to where he was going.# Zechariah 2:2b And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to measure Jerusalem.# Zechariah was in Jerusalem that had been abandonded for 70 years. Zechariah 7:14, Ezekiel 33:28# Nehemiah mentions the conditions the city was in\u0026hellip;The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.\u0026rdquo; Nehemiah 1:3, 2:17# Zechariah 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him\u0026hellip;, While Zechariah is still considering where the man (angel) is going to measure, another angel heads out to meet him.# Zechariah 2:4a and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting angel to run!# Zechariah 2:4b \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. The urgent message was that one day Jerusalem would be filled with multitudes of men and cattle.# Though the date of fulfillment is not stated, it would have been of great encouragement that day!# Knowing of Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s future prosperity would promote the rebuilding of the temple.# Such an increase in population as here predicted could not come from the return of a large number of Jews from Babylon; it looks on to a far future day, indicated in verse 5. 5# Zechariah 2:5a \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for walls.# Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy attacks. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3# Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it\u0026rsquo;s even harder to see her not needing walls.# Just like God would be the walls around a prosperous Jerusalem in the future, so could God be the walls of protection around a tattered one. By faith, trusting in God\u0026rsquo;s protection, Judah was safe because the Lord of hosts was for them to rebuild the temple.# Zechariah 2:5b and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem herself but God in her midst. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11# What a delightful future hope Judah is given. In the very spot where Zechariah was standing, would one day be filled with people and animals. God would be the protecting wall around her and the glory in her midst. Psalm 46:5# Zechariah 2:7-9 The unmoved exiles# Zechariah 2:6 \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# The land of the north is probably referring to Babylon. Jeremiah 6:22; 16:16# Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem but you had to go north out of Israel to get there.# This was directed to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not warning them flee and return to the land.# This began then but continues today due to the lethargic response of the people who got decided to remain in their foreign lands.# Zechariah 2:7 \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; Two religious systems are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.# The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the children of the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17# This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Revelation 17:5# The command is for God\u0026rsquo;s people to flee the idolatrous of Babylon which has covered the four winds of earth.# Zechariah 2:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10, Psalm 105:15# blessings and curses fall on nations based on their treatment of Israel. Nobody touches her and gets away with it. He is her defender. Jeremiah 2:3, Revelation 17:14# Since the nations had plundered them, God would manifest glory by plundering them.# The Lord does not visit judgment on Israel’s plunderers after He is dwelling in Zion, but before it. Zechariah 12-14; Revelation 16-20# Zechariah 2:9a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately shatter them like earthenware and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2# In a show of power, God will make these nations (them) to serve Israel (their slaves). One day Israel will be the greatest nation on earth. Isaiah 14:2, Zephaniah 2:9# Zechariah 2:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. A most important aspect of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled.# Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;you will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo; Exodus 6:7# The phrase \u0026ldquo;you will know\u0026rdquo; occurs 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know it was God because God had told them. Zechariah 2:9, 11, 4:9, 6:15# Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no doubt of its fulfillment. Ezekiel 12:20, Zechariah 4:9, John 8:28# Zechariah 2:10-11 - The discouraged returnees# Zechariah 2:10a \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; The daughter of Zion (God\u0026rsquo;s people) needed to rejoice instead of bemoning their current circumstances with their heads hung low.# Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9# Zechariah 2:10b for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. This is a Messianic prophecy. One day, Messia Zechariah 1:16,# Dwell (SHAKAN) conveys the idea of residing or permanently staying.# Zechariah 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.# Zechariah uses a term \u0026lsquo;in that day\u0026rsquo; 19 times throughout the book. It can refer to the period of time defined by the context but also it can refer to a speciic period known as The Day of the Lord.# This is a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel\u0026rsquo;s rule.# The Day of the Lord - a brief explanation# The Day of the Lord is a major eschatological theme. It is a common topic in both New and Old Testaments.# Of the 19 uses of \u0026lsquo;in that day\u0026rsquo; in the book of Zechariah, 16 of those times are in chapters 12-14. We\u0026rsquo;ve listed those we believe refer to The Day of the Lord in the order of their appearance.# The nations will be united to the Lord# Zechariah 2:11 \u0026ldquo;*Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people\u0026hellip;*Zechariah 13:9# There will be prosperity and safety# Zechariah 3:10 *\u0026hellip;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree\u0026hellip;*Micah 4:4, Jeremiah 31:5, 32:15,# Zechariah 9:16-17 *\u0026hellip;God will save them in that day As the flock of His people\u0026hellip;*Zechariah 12:8,# The Lord of hosts goes to battle against the nations, protecting Jerusalem# Zechariah 12:3 *\u0026hellip;I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples\u0026hellip;*Joel 3:2, 9-15, Revelation 19, Obadiah 1:15# Zechariah 12:4 \u0026hellip;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness.

From here He will dwell with Israel and reign over the whole earth.# God dwelling in their midst is what the tabernacle and temple symbolized. Exodus 25:8# Zechariah 2:11c and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Messiah, God himself, in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day dwell in their midst forever.# In the person of Christ, God will literally dwell among His people in Jerusalem. Zechariah 8:3, Ezekiel 48:8,# Zechariah 2:12 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.# Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God\u0026rsquo;s people.# They did not walk with God as a nation in keeping the covenant, and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25# Zechariah 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4# Zechariah 3:1-10 A vision of Joshua the high priest# Zechariah 3:1a Then he showed me Joshua the high priest as a priest, Zechariah would have known Joshua well.# Zechariah 3:1b standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. This setting reminds us of Job. Job was blameless before people and the Lord brings him up.# This time, Satan brings up Joshua the High priest and accuse him before the angel of the LORD Job 1:6-12; 2:1- 7; 1 Chronicles 21:1; Revelation 12:10# Zechariah 3:2a The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! This preincarnate altercation between Christ and Satan shows the ongoing battle that wages on throughout history.# Zechariah 3:2b the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusation is directed against Joshua who symbolizes Jerusalem.# Zechariah 3:2c Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Israel was plucked out the fire. Not once, not twice, but many times.# In context perhaps this is referring to being delivered from Babylon.# Zechariah 3:3a Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments This was Joshua\u0026rsquo;s condition representing the priesthood and all of Israel. There was not need for Satan to try to find something, the situation was obvious. The stench of the soiled garments alone gives him away.# Zechariah saw Joshua standing before the angel of the LORD dressed in excrement bespattered garments. Isaiah 4:41# Filthy garments did not symbolize the criminal in Israel, but one in the pollution of sin. 5# Isa 64:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.# Zechariah 3:3b-4a and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him,# Zechariah 3:4b saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Joshua represents the current state of Israel.# What a delightful scene to see the Angel of the Lord defending Joshua and exchanging his filthy clothes for clean ones.# Zechariah 3:4c Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; If dirty clothes symbolized iniquity then festal robes must mean righteousness as a result of being fully forgiven.# Isaiah 61:10 I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.# This is a spiritual transformation by divine interaction. From being in a state of feeling shame to feeling accepted. Micah 7:18-19, Isaiah 51:2,\nZechariah (being a priest himself) can\u0026rsquo;t contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on and exclaims\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 3:5a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; The priestly garment included a turban. Leviticus 8:9# clean (TAHOR) - implies the sense of purity.# The mitre or turban of the high priest had fastened to it the plate of gold engraved with the words “Holiness to the Lord.” Exodus 28:36-385# Zechariah 3:5b So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. Zechariah as priest is seen intervening on behalf of Joshua.# This is so essential to the message of grace then and now.# It was the Lord who removed unrighteousness. Joshua the priest, even the high priest, took no part whatsoever.# It was God who clothed Him with festal robes. The dress goes beyond being acceptable, they are appropriate for service to the Lord. These were the robes for festal worship!# The same is true today for the Church age saint. We have been clothed in the righteousness of Christ. His righteouness has been imputed to our account. This is justification.# We can fall prey to Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusations and enter a downward spiral of self-condemnation. Doubt and discouragement are sure to follow. Jude 1:20-23# There is no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus. Jude 1:24-25# Christian, wear your festal robes with rejoicing!# Zechariah 3:6-7a And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, The admonishment comes after the Lord has defended him and taken away His iniquity.# Joshua will now be reinstated\nZechariah 3:7b \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, having been cleansed, having had their sins taken away by the Lord, now Joshua is told to walk in God\u0026rsquo;s ways and in His service.# As Joshua stands before the Lord in festal robes, he is admonished by the Lord to walk in His ways as a representative of who He is.# Here we that twice the condition \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; is given. This is a reponsability given to Joshua. He is to walk in God\u0026rsquo;s ways and perform His service.# Unfortunately, we so often hear that cleansing only comes after we remove our sin or if we try hard enough not to sin.# Acceptance before God is not earned through service. Service to God is the outworking of the acceptance one already has before the Lord.# *If\u0026hellip;you will walk\u0026hellip;*the first condition was of a personal nature. Joshua was to have regard for his personal walk with the Lord first and foremost.# *If\u0026hellip;you will perform\u0026hellip;*the second condition was then to perform ministerial service of the temple.# Joshua is being charged to walk with God in fellowship in order for ministerial service to take place. God is reestablishing the priestly duties under the Mosaic covenant.# Zechariah 3:7c then you will also govern My house\u0026hellip; The Lord of Hosts gave the priests the responsibility to govern the temple so long as they walked in His ways. Ezekiel 44:15-16# govern (DIN) - this carries with it the idea of to judge.# If\u0026hellip;then you will govern My house \u0026hellip;refers to the Temple then in building. The duties of the priests included deciding and judging between clean and unclean. Leviticus 10:8,10, Deuteronomy 17:9, Ezekiel 44:23, and Malachi 2:7 5# Ironically, when the Lord Jesus came, He confronted the hypocrisy of the chief priests and removed all doubt that they had lost this privilege for their failure to keep the first clause, \u0026ldquo;if you will walk in my ways\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. Matthew 21:23-27# Zechariah 3:7d and also have charge of My courts\u0026hellip; the courts must refer to that which took place in the event of quarrels. The religious leaders were to act as judges and deal with fairness and justice.# The courts, too, had to be guarded from profanation; care had to be exercised as to the kind of persons who were to be allowed to enter.5# Zechariah 3:7e and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest.# This was possible only to priests who were ritually and morally pure. Exodus 40:30-33# The conditions were put as to the condition of experience and service, not acceptance.# Governing things regarding the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in His ways first and foremost.# In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5# Prior to ministry service, the church age saint is first to be walking in fellowship, abiding in Christ. John 15:4-5, Romans 8:12-13# It is the spiritual believer,learning from the Word through the teaching of the Spirit, that is equipped for the ministry of service. Ephesians 4:11-12# Zechariah 3:8a \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.# Zechariah 3:8b you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends refers to the priesthood.# They set apart to be a type or symbolize what God will one day provide in a perfect Priest from a higher order.# While Joshua and his collegues would serve in the earthly temple, Christ who entered the Holy of Holies in heaven, who is seated at the right hand of the father, will one day serve in the Millenial temple as the Priest and King.# Zechariah 3:8a for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. What this is saying that the temple service of the priests was prophet and to be fulfilled by God\u0026rsquo;s Servant, the Branch.# My servant. Clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5, Luke 11:37-54, Isaiah 42:1, 49:3, 50:10, 52:13, 53:11, Ezekiel 34:23-24, Philippians 2:6-8# The Branch (sprout) is a man, who will build the Temple of the Lord. Zechariah 3:8, Isaiah 11:1, Isaiah 60:21, Jeremiah 23:5, Jeremiah 33:15, Revelation 22:16, Isaiah 4:2, 11:1; 53:2, Jeremiah 23:5; 33:15# It will be the Branch will build the Millenial temple, which is unlike any other temple. Zechariah 6:12-13# Zechariah 3:9a \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. This addition is very interesting\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;before Joshua\u0026rdquo; the stone.# Here we see a third name for Messiah, the stone. While we know Christ is the prophesied cornerstone. Genesis 49:24, Psalm 118:22; Isaiah 28:16; Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11; and 1 Peter 2:6# Zechariah adds descriptive information to the stone. It has seven eyes, probably referring to the attribute of omniscience the Messiah will possess.# These may be the same seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.# Daniel, when describing the characteristics of Antichrist states he has eyes like a man\u0026rsquo;s. Daniel 7:8, 11:21, Zechariah 11:17# Zechariah 3:9b Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.# While the work of the cross is implied here and certainly the iniquity of the land being removed is on the basis of the victory acquired by Messiah on the cross, it is not referring to that here. Hebrews 10:10, 12, 14# This is the day, the very day iniquity is removed of the land\u0026hellip;that is\u0026hellip;the day of her forgiveness when all of Israel will place their faith in Jesus Messiah.# This is a once for all event. There will be no need for a repetition or renewal; His work will be once for all.# Zechariah 3:10a \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor\u0026hellip;# When Israel is found in such a spiritual condition-so reads the united testimony of the Old Testament, material prosperity is always promised her. 5# Thus we read of the peace and prosperity of the time in verse 10. 1 Kings 4:25, Micah 4:4# Zechariah 3:10b to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is an image of peace and blessing will be like in the kingdom age due to their iniquity being absolved.# Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakuk 3:17# This vision is regarding Joshua the high priest as he stands accused before the Angel of the Lord. Joshua represents the priesthood and It appears to be the reaffirming of the priests for typical service until the Messiah would come to build His temple.# If the spiritual leadership of Judah needed encouraging, no doubt the civil leadership did as well. The next vision will deal with that.# Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold# The following vision is directed for Zerubbabel.# Who is Zerubbabel?# The civil governor of Judah# Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ. Matthew 1:6, 12# His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge.# Zechariah 4:1 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. The word then shows this vision came afterward. Since the vision was at night, the interpreting angel roused Zechariah so he was wide awake when receiving the vision.# Zechariah 4:2a He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks\u0026hellip;# Many who make no distinction between the Church and Israel (a demarcation which is one of the clearest in the Bible), think the figure stands for the Church. 5# It is true that lampstands are used as a figure of the Church in Revelation 1:12, 20, and that the Church is compared to lights in Philippians 2:15, but the Church is not a matter of prophecy in the Old Testament. 5# The Church is first foretold in the New Testament in Matthew 16:18.5# Zechariah 4:2b and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Exodus 25:37# Zechariah 4:3 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:4 Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said,\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:6a Then he said to me,\u0026hellip;we note the particular build-up and suspence for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained.# Zechariah 4:6b \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,\u0026hellip; this is a specific message to Zerubbabel.# We know from the prophet Ezra that Zerubbabel listened and followed what God commanded. Ezra 5:2# Therefore this message is of a different tone than it was to the people in general. Zechariah is of a sincere nature but evidently is trying to bring about results in his own strength.# Zechariah 4:6c \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,\u0026hellip;\u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip;# As a chosen leader, Zerubbabel must have had natural talents and abilities. Yet God is saying not civil, political, physical, natural or any kind of human power but God says the temple building will be brought about by His Spirit.# God is offering Zerubbabel an option that perhaps Zerubbabel had been too busy to even consider. God says this, what about trusting My power to be your strength?# The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they began rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14# This is a wonderful illustration to show how God wants us to live as Christians. The teaching of God\u0026rsquo;s grace is what instructs us how to really live; to trust, to depent on God for His strength (My Spirit) not our own (power). Titus 2:11-12# All believers get their enabling strenghtening by grace (Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2)# The grace of God teaches God\u0026rsquo;s full provision for salvation from sin\u0026rsquo;s penalty and for the provision of daily living being delivered from sin\u0026rsquo;s power, while pointing to the amazing hope of our final redemption.# This is certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026ldquo;ease does not produce strength\u0026rdquo;. They teach that one must find strength through spiritual disciplines.# God\u0026rsquo;s power certainly does not lack man\u0026rsquo;s strength and He freely bestows it to those believers who take Him up on the option to trust Him. 1 Samuel 14:6, Hosea 1:7, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, Hebrews 11:34, 2 Corinthians 4:7# The lampstand symbolizes Israel when she is fully restored as the means of light fueled by the Holy Spirit (the unending supply of oil), unto the world. Exodus 19:6# They were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. This summarizes chapters 3 and 4.# Zechariah 4:7a \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; Mountains can symbolize different things in Scripture.# In this case the mountain is how Zerubbabel sees his current situation. The obstacles are a great mountain.# Yet nothing is too great for the man who has the Lord of Hosts battling for him. A weak man who is God\u0026rsquo;s instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable by the impossible!# The task Zerubbabel is given is from first to last a spiritual work, it must be by the om- nipotent and unfailing and unerring Spirit of God.# Zechariah 4:7b and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is the what is placed at the end of a building to complete it.# Zerubbabel will see the temple finished, but not the way he might have thought.# The shouting of grace to the Messiah would be meaningless. The idea is that the grace of God in the power of the Holy Spirit will make this work to be realized. Not by God\u0026rsquo;s intervention, not man\u0026rsquo;s might but by God\u0026rsquo;s power enabling the human vessel who trusts Him!# The shouts at the end are grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba! The people will credit the completion to be God\u0026rsquo;s working. To God is the glory when God motivates and strengthens His laborours unto His work! Ezra 6:14# God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit glorifies God, not our strength (might, prowess, ability, wisdom). The shouts of grace, grace, demonstrates trust in God for the results.# Our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work when we trust Him. The evidence\u0026hellip;God brought it about! This is God using Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s hands as instruments to bring glory to himself. To God is the glory!# One day all of Israel will recognize the high cost that needed to be paid for their redemption and they will see their Savior as the one they pierced. The value of grace is understood only upon the realization of the payment Christ made. Zechariah 12:10, John 19:34, Acts 2:32, 36-37# Zechariah 4:8-9a Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Haggai 2:23# Once the rebuilding started back up, it took 4 years and 3 months for this promise to be literally fulfilled. Ezra 6:15# The second temple was finished 70 years after the first one was destroyed.# Zechariah 4:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Me is not Zechariah but Messiah.# This is the people rejoicing in response, giving credence to God\u0026rsquo;s provision.# Zechariah 4:10a \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things?# The second temple wasn\u0026rsquo;t as glorious as the first. The older generation that had seen Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple were sorely disappointed.# When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with raw materials. He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world.# On the other hand, Zurabbabel had God instructing Him and the His Spirit as the power.# Zechariah 4:10b But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel a plumb line is an instrument for building.# Zechariah 4:10c these are the eyes of the LORD the seven eyes Revelation 5:6# The running of God’s eyes throughout the whole earth speaks of God’s providential care put forth for the finishing of the Temple. (For the same figure see 2 Ch 16:9.)# Zechariah 4:10d which range to and for throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; God sees everything\u0026hellip;nothing is hidden from Him. Isaiah 40:27, Matthew 6:6, 8, 18# Zechariah 4:10 But these seven\u0026hellip;will see and be glad\u0026hellip; Don’t despise things that appear small! What matters is how the Lord sees it!# The omniscient Lord would be pleased when He saw the building project restarted.# The second temple serves as a type of the humble aspect of Messiah. The second temple was despised for it\u0026rsquo;s humble size, so too the Messiah would appear as a humble servant.# God rejoices in the day when the second temple was completed just like He will be delighted when the restoration of Israel is complete through the work of Messiah. Isaiah 53# Zechariah 4:11 Then I answered and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; The lamp doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to draw Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s attention like the olive trees on each side.# Zechariah 4:12a And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,# Zechariah 4:12b which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:13 So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:14a Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; The answer is given as to the significance of the two trees beside the lampstand.# Anointed ones literally means sons of oil.# Man is often compared to a tree in the Old Testament. Psalm 1:3, 52:8, Jeremiah 17:8, Daniel 4:10# There are many differing opinions as to the identity of these two annointed ones.# Chapters three and four are connected and complementary. The priestly office (Joshua) and the civil office (Zerubbabel) have been dealt with accordingly.# An interesting consideration for the identity of these two annointed ones are the very two men the context refers to; Joshua and Zerubbabel.# Someone has suggested the two witnesses are the two offices (priesthood and civic) expressed in \u0026ldquo;sons of oil\u0026rdquo; to carry out the role.# Can we see this sort of thing anywhere else?# The book of Revelation mentions two witnesses. The identity of these two witnesses also remains a mystery, however applying the same reasoning, Moses (civil power) and Elijah (religious power). Revelation 11:3-4# If these two in Revelation are Moses and Elijah, there are the civil and religious powers represented as with Zerubbabel and Joshua. 5# The beast (civil power) and the false prophet (religious power) would be an interesting falsification of this union. Revelation 13# The ultimate fulfillment of verse 14 is the Messiah, who is both King and Priest. Zechariah 6:11-13 5# Zechariah 4:14b Lord of the whole earth\u0026hellip; Is clearly a reference to Christ. Revelation 11:4# The fulfillment of this is when Messiah will be Lord of the whole earth.# Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll# Chapter 5 deals with God\u0026rsquo;s judgment on Israel while the nations will be judged in chapter 6.# Individual judgment on Israel# Zechariah 5:1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, Zechariah looked up again and saw a two sided scroll swooping down.# It had writing on the one side and writing on the other. Zechariah 5:3# Zechariah 5:2 \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; The scroll was very large and twice as long as it was wide.# The porch in front of the nave of the first temple was twenty cubits by ten cubits. 1 Kings 6:3# The dimensions of the two cherubim were ten cubits high and together totalled 20 cubits wide with their wings spread out. 1 Kings 6:23-27# The vision would teach us that the holiness of the sanctuary of the Lord is the measure of sin and that judgment must begin at the house of God. 1 Peter 4:17-185# Zechariah 5:3a Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; This time the angel interprets the meaning right away. The flying scroll represents a curse. Ezekiel 2:9-3:27, Jeremiah 36, Revelation 5, Isaiah 30:8# Under the Mosaic covenant agreement, the people experienced blessings when they kept it but cursings when they didn\u0026rsquo;t. Deuteronomy 27:15-26, 28:15-68# This curse is not intended for the whole earth but for the whole land of Israel. This is a curse directed specifically at individual people of Israel for not keeping the covenant.# Zechariah 5:3b surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, Malachi 3:6-9, Zechariah 8:17# Just like the law was given to Moses on two tablets, the scroll had two sides. The writing on one side dealt with sins committed against God, while the writing on the other side was regarding sins committed against man. Exodus 32:15-16# The first tablet were commandments dealing with God, while the second tablet was how to treat man.# Stealing would be breaking the middle command on the second tablet.# Zechariah 5:3c and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. Jeremiah 5:2# Swearing falsely by God\u0026rsquo;s name is breaking the middle commandment on one first tablet.# Zechariah 5:4a \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, Malachi 3:5# God himself says he will make the curse go forth. The curse will be totally successful in it\u0026rsquo;s purpose of cutting out the violators of the law.# Zechariah 5:4b \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; The curse will hit the house of those judged by the flying scroll. Proverbs 11:1# The people had turned to dishonest means (lying and swearing) so that they could build their elaborate homes. Haggai 1:3-4, 6, 9# Haggai 2:9 \u0026ldquo;Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high To be delivered from the hand of calamity!# Haggai 2:10 \u0026ldquo;You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself.# Haggai 2:11 \u0026ldquo;Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework.# Zechariah 5:4c *and it will spend the night\u0026hellip;*this phrase could also be translated it shall remain. Some suggest this to be the better interpretation. Psalm 49:12, Exodus 20:5, Proverbs 3:33# Zechariah 5:4d within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo; The curse will go into the house of the ones found guilty by the scroll. Their house would be consumed. Amos 3:15# Those who built their home sanctuaries using dishonest means while ignoring God\u0026rsquo;s house will have no place to hide, the curse will enter their home and consume it. Habakkuk 2:9-11, James 5:2-3# Nothing will be left of their own house for which they have worked so hard, for which they had neglected God’s house. Haggai 1:4# Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket# Verses 5-11 deal with national judgment on Israel in a future time. While the previous sin deals with sinful deeds, this vision deals with sin as a whole or system.# Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; Following the vision of the scroll, Zechariah was encouraged to look up again.# Zechariah 5:6a I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; the ephah was a standard unit of measuring volume. It was associated with a certain container.# The ephah was a dry measure used for measuring barley or wheat. Therefore it is a symbol of commerce or trade. Ezekiel 45:9-11, Amos 8:5, Isaiah 5:10# Zechariah 5:6b-7a Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land# The Berean study Bible renders this verse as their iniquity through all the land.# The ephah as a whole symbolized their iniquity or appearance in the land as a whole.# The implication is that it had become a national problem. This was not just an issue on an individual level. They had become nationally known for using dishonest measures.# Zechariah 5:7b (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; This must be connected to the people who were using dishonest gain but it does not need to be specific since the next verse we are told the ephah represents all the wickedness in the land.# On top of the ephah was placed a heavy cover.# Inside the small barrel was a woman.# It is possible that the lead cover symbolizes ministry of the Holy Spirit in restraining evil. 11# Zechariah 5:8 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; The identity of the woman in the basket is given as the representation of wickedness.# Wickedness includes Idolatry and all other forms of evil. Ezra 9, Isaiah 57, 65:1-7, 66:17# The woman (wickedness), is contained within the ephah (commerce) with a lead weight (perhaps the restraining of the Holy Spirit).# In Hebrew, the feminime is used to present abstract concepts. Proverbs 2:16 and 5:3-4# Zechariah 5:8 And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. Even with the lid opened for a brief moment, wickedness wanted to get out but she was thrown in by the angel and contained by the lid.# During the church age, the Holy Spirit plays the important role of restraining the man of lawlessness. 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8# After the church age, during the Tribulation period, wickedness will not be held back. She will do as she pleases, wherever she pleases. However a time will come when God will remove wickedness from Israel.# Zechariah 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; two women were needed because of the weight.# Zechariah 5:9 and they had wings like the wings of a stork, A stork is a large bird and common to describe the appearance of the women.# Zechariah 5:9 and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. The ephah was lifted up.# Zechariah 5:10 I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; This time, Zechariah didn\u0026rsquo;t ask who these were or what the ephah was but where they were taking it.# The ephah will be removed from the land of Israel, but where?# Zechariah 5:11 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; Wickedness will be carried away from the land of Israel to Shinar.# The reference in the land of Shinar is to Babylonia. This was the land where man had first united in a universal rebellion against God. Genesis 10:10, 11:2, 11# Genesis 11:2, 4 It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there..They said, \u0026ldquo;Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:11 and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo; Once the temple is prepared, wickedness will have a fixed resting place as an object of worship.# Babylon stands throughout Scripture for confusion in spiritual matters, for idolatry, for spiritual uncleanness. Revelation 17:3-5# Just like in the days of Nimrod, the people will once again unite under a common purpose to make a name for themselves and instead of scattering, they will flock together and build wickedness a house. 12# The Lord is allowing evil to play its course. Wickedness will have her own temple and be set up to be worshipped. Her power will be great over the people to bring unity in two main areas:# One common, forced religion. Revelation 13:12-15# One governmental, forced commerce. Revelation 13:16-17# The fulfillment of this vision must be future. It cannot be interpreted as referring to the exile to Babylon since they had already returned.# The city of Babylon will be made a perpetual desolation with nothing dwelling in it. This can never be said to have happened to Babylon.# The city of Babylon was never been destroyed in the way God said it would be. 13# Jeremiah foretold of Babylon\u0026rsquo;s literal future destruction. Jeremiah 50-51 14# Jeremiah 51:62 and say, \u0026lsquo;You, O LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.\u0026rsquo;# When Medo-Persia overthrew Babylon, the city was never affected.# Hundreds of years later, Alexander the Great stayed in Babylon. In fact, It is said that Alexander wanted to rebuild the Tower of Babel.# Wickedness will become centralized as she sits on her pedestal in her house in Babylon (Shinar). She will continue her influence on the nations until Babylon is destroyed at the end of the Tribulation. Revelation 17-18# We will see the fulfillment of this in greater detail in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s second burden.# Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots# Zechariah 6:1-8 Judgment on the nations# Zechariah 6:1-3 The vision# Zechariah 6:1a Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth\u0026hellip; Zechariah looks and he sees four chariots coming.# Chariots typically were used in battle. These chariots are going out in a war-like fashion to execute judgment. Psalm 46:9# Chariots often symbolize power and authority. Psalm 20:7, Isaiah 66:15, Habakuk 3:8, Haggai 2:22# Some suggest the 4 chariots symbolize the 4 empires in Daniel. This seems unlikely.# Zechariah 6:1b from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. The chariots came from between two mountains. Psalm 36:6# We are not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. There is no reason to think these mountains are not physical locations since the destination of the chariots are geographical locations, therefore the place of origin must be as well. Zechariah 6:8# It may be that the place of origin of the chariots are mount zion and mount olives divided by the valley of Jehoshafat. Zechariah 14:4# The bronze in Scripture is often where God’s judgement deals with sin. Numbers 21:9, John 3, Revelation 1:15# The prophet Joel mentions the valley of Jehoshaphat in relation the judgment of the nations. Joel 3:2, 12# Zechariah 6:2-3 With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses...# earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three colours of horses. The meaning of the horse colors are not explained to us.# Revelation 6 mentions horses of the same colours although they proceed in a different order.# Red - takes peace, men slay one another. Symbolizes war and bloodshed# Black - often symbolizes death and famine# Strong dappled or grizzled - possibly plagues# White - often symbolizes triumph and victory. In Revelation 6 it refers to the Antichrist while in Zechariah it refers to God\u0026rsquo;s agents claiming victory.# There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does equate to identity.# Zechariah 6:4-8 The Interpretation# This vision clearly shows how the Lord almighty is in control over sovereigns. It regards divine judgment on Gentile nations rin relation to their poor treatment to Israel. Isaiah 66:15# Zechariah 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wishes to know the identity of the horse pulled chariots.# what are these - this was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s question regarding the vision with the horseman, the 4 horns, and the two olive trees.# One day the same question will be asked regarding the Messiah\u0026rsquo;s wounds between His arms. Zechariah 13:6# Zechariah 6:5 The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, The angel\u0026rsquo;s answer refers to the question Zechariah makes.# The Lord of all the earth - is a term used to describe the Lord as the sovereign of the earth.# When Joshua crosses the Jordan to posess the land. Joshua 3:11, 13# When Israel is made strong and plunders the nations before the Millennium. Micah 4:13# The word spirits (RUACH) can be translated breath, wind, or spirit . There are some who say these are spirits and others who say they are angels.# Do people carry these judgments out or are they angels? Arguments exist for both sides.# Having been in the presence of the Lord (Sovereign) of all the earth, these four winds were His messengers, the executors of His will. Psalm 104:4, Hebrews 1:7# These are four spirits sent out before the Lord. Four spirits (winds) many times refers to divine judicial judgment. Daniel 7:2, Revelation 7:1# Zechariah 6:6a with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, One group of horses goes north. The other group goes south.# Directions in Scripture are in relation to Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem is at the center (naval) of the earth according to God. Ezekiel 38:12, Ezekiel 5:5# Jewish tradition teaches that the center of Israel is Jerusalem. The center of Jerusalem is the Temple which has the holy place as its center which contains the ark in its center and in the center of the ark. 15# Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemies always attacked from the north or from the south. To the west of Jerusalem is the Mediteranean sea. To the east is an impassable desert.# The black horses go north, the direction from which most of Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemy invaders descended on the Promised Land. Jeremiah 1:14; 4:6; 6:22; Ezekiel 1:4# Babylon would have invaded Israel from the north. South of Israel is Egypt. Ezekiel 39:2# Zechariah 6:6b-7a while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; All the chariot teams seem eager to execute the command.# Egypt lay to Israel\u0026rsquo;s south, and it was another implacable enemy.# Zechariah 6:7b And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth. The context calls for a broader scope than the land of Israel. This is a patrol sent to the whole earth.# The reality is that the Lord of all the earth will execute judgment on all of Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemies.# Zechariah 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The Lord now responds to Zechariah as the vision plays out.# It is probable that verse 6 and verse 8 refer to Babylon. If this is the case, this is merely a temporary appeasement of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath against Babylon since Babylon will be reserved for judgment. Zechariah 5:5-11, Revelation 17-18# Zechariah 6:8 have appeased My wrath in the land of the north. The black horses and white horses brought judgment upon the land of the north and appeased God\u0026rsquo;s anger.# Since the chariots went in compass directions, we should probably understand their judgment to be universal. Zechariah 2:6; Jeremiah 49:36; Ezekiel 37:9; Revelation 7:11# This vision presents several difficulties in its details, however the message is clear. God will have vengeance on those nations who have mistreated Israel.# Zechariah’s vision assures us that God is in control of the future and will judge the Gentile nations during “the day of the Lord.” God is longsuffering. 2 Peter 3:916# However, there comes a time when nations “fill up the measure of their sins” and then God’s judgment must fall. Genesis 15:16, Matthew 23:32# Following the destruction of Babylon we will see Messiah usher in the 1000 year Kingdom.# Zechariah 6:9-15 A crown fit for The King# In the vision in chapter three we saw the priestly line being reinstated and in chapter four we saw the royal line represented by Zerubbabel. Zechariah is told to have a crown made and hold a ceremony crowning the priest, which symbolically points ahead to Messiah who will serve in the capacity of priest and king, a union of the two offices.# The eight night visions have ended, but the coronation of Joshua is closely connected with these revelations which extend in scope from Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s day to the full establishment of Israel in blessing.17# Zechariah 6:9-10a The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, Zechariah was to receive a gift from a group of exiles who had arrived from Babylon.# Zechariah 6:10b from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; Zechariah was instructed to receive an offering (not demand it) from these exiles. These exiles were gracious givers who wanted to contribute towards the temple building. Ezra 1:4, 6# While it is not Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s job to receive offerings for the building project, God sends Zechariah to collect this special offering and will give it a singular purpose.# Zechariah 6:10b and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. God specifically tells Zechariah to go to a specific person\u0026rsquo;s house and meet those men there.# Zechariah 6:11 \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. This calls the attention of the listener. Crown for a priest? This is strange, as you don\u0026rsquo;t crown a priest.# Crown - The Hebrew shows it should be plural, except in verse 14 it is singular. Revelation 19:12# Kings were to be from the tribe of Judah while priests could only be from the tribe of Levi. Gen 49:10,# No king could be serve in the office of priest and no priest could serve in the office as king.# Anybody that mixed the two offices of priest and king suffered terrible consequences.# Saul - 1 Samuel 13 relates how king Saul tries to take on priestly duties to help. Though he was told he did it anyway and the consequence for doing it was that his kingdom was taken from him that very day.# Uzziah - 2 Chronicles 26# Jeroboam - as king took on the prerogative to add two other places of worship, at Dan and Bethel. Two things come into play here. He got involved in the office as priest but primarily he played with the lineage of kings, specifically the line of David. 1 Kings 12:26-31, 1 Kings 14:9, 1 Kings 11:32, 1 Kings 11:28-29# Joshua here serves as a type of a priest that will be crowned as king. To be warranted by God and the two offices joined in one person meant only one thing, this was referring to the Messiah. God\u0026rsquo;s annointed priest-king.# Christ is still a priest but is seated behind the veil on the Father\u0026rsquo;s throne. Today, Christ is not reigning as king. He has not been crowned yet. He will one day return to earth and will be crowned as king and function as priest and king in the Millenial age. Revelation 3:20# Zechariah 6:12a \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, The branch is a referrence to Messiah. Zechariah 3:8, Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, Jeremiah 33:14-18# Zechariah 6:12b for He will branch out from where He is; After the identity of this Man is established to be Messiah, we now are told what He will do.# This speaks of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s very humble beginning when He comes. Isaiah 53:2, John 19:5,# Zechariah 6:12c and He will build the temple of the LORD. This speaks of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s second coming to build the fourth temple which will be during the Millenium. Ezekiel 40-46# Instead of using the more common word for temple BAYIT, the word temple here is HEYKAL (translated temple or palace).# Verses 12, 13, 14, 15 and 8:9 use the word HEYKAL to describe the temple (or palaceb) of the Lord. Haggai 2:18# Ezekiel 8-11 The Shekinah glory departs from the first temple.# Ezekiel 40-46 - The Shekinah glory returns to the fourth temple.# Since the first temple was literal, we can assume the fourth temple will also be literal.# The dimensions given for the fourth temple are literal and cannot be understood unless one takes it to be a physical temple with physical measurements.# This temple will not be built until the Millenium and will only be erected during the Millenium since there is no physical temple in the Eternal State. Revelation 21:22# Prior to Jesus, the Jews always believed this verse was Messianic.# Zechariah 6:13a \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor\u0026hellip;He will build the temple and he will bear the honor\u0026hellip;While Zerubbabel was instrumental in building the second temple, he was did not receive honor, God did.# The temple Jesus will build will be the millenial temple and He will receive all the honor for the building of it.# Zechariah 6:13b and sit and rule on His throne. He will build the temple and set up His throne in it.# This speaks of two different roles. He sits and He rules. He sits as priest because of His finished redemptive work and rules as king from His throne. Revelation 3:20# The Branch\u0026rsquo;s kingdom would be widespread. Furthermore, He would build the temple of Yahweh. Zerubbabel, not Joshua, was God\u0026rsquo;s choice to build the restoration temple (4:9-10), but Messiah, whom Joshua prefigured, would build the future temple for Yahweh. Isaiah 2:2-4; 56:6-7; Ezekiel 40—43; Micah 4:1-7; Haggai 2:6-9).18# Zechariah 6:13c Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; The Priest will not only reign on a throne but His rule will be categorized by peace between the office of priest and office of king. The king will rule from His throne. This is the Davidic throne promised beforehand. 2 Samuel 7:12-16# Upon the merging of the two offices, Jesus will usher in world peace (shalom).# He brings peace with God judicially# He brings peace of God in the heart# He brings physical, world peace# Zechariah 6:14 \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. The crown(s) serves as a reminder and that Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s temple will be built. This will serve as a reminder for those generous exiles (that generation) who returned and took part building the second temple.# However it also points to a greater fulfillment in the very Man who the crown is made for, the Priest-King, Messiah who will come and build the fourth temple and reign from it.# Zechariah 6:15a \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 31:10# Those who are far off is referring to the scattered people of Israel who will come to build the millenial temple.# Zechariah 6:15b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. Acts 2:39# Complete obedience is referring to that which is only accessed by faith in Jesus Christ and his finished (complete) obedience and payment for sin on the cross. This will take place when Israel as a nation recognizes Jesus Messiah.# the fulfillment of the covenant promises will come to pass when they as a nation are right with God. Not merely practicing the rituals but with a right heart before God. This is what will take place when Israel puts their faith in Yahweh, specifically Jesus, Yahweh.# Zechariah 7-8 - The Third Message: Four Messages# Zechariah 7:1-14 The mourners who forget why# After the 8 visions, Zechariah now continues the theme of the book, returning to the Lord. Some 14 months have passed since Zechariah preached his first message from the Lord to return to Him. Haggai 2:12-16# As it happens, the people decided to take up national fasts to remember the temple, the destruction of Jerusalem and other important events. This has been going on for 70 years now and the people of Bethel send a group of people to ask the priests if they should continue or not.# The people, especially the older generation, missed Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple, the glory days of Jerusalem and the way things used to me. Their trust was focused on returning to those \u0026ldquo;glory\u0026rdquo; days. Jeremiah 7:4# Their theological understanding of returning is about returning to when things were better. They were mistaken to focus on the historical blessings instead of the giver of the blessings.# Their reason for seeking God was that His blessings would return, not because they were desirous to return to Him.# The next two chapters deals with clarifying this misunderstanding.# First, God will show them the error of their thinking. Then, He will show them where (or who) their faith should be placed on.# Zechariah 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. 14 months had passed between Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s first last message and this third one.# Zechariah 7:2 Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,# Bethel means house of God, probably about 12 miles north of Jerusalem. At the time of the writing of Zechariah, Bethel was part of Judah, not Samaria. Ezra 2:28# we don\u0026rsquo;t see Regemmelech mentioned any other place. However there is a Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father, the Assyrian king Sennacherib, and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38# Esarhaddon began to reign in place of his father, Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37# It is of some interest to note that Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, \u0026ldquo;Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.\u0026rdquo; Ezra 4:2# Were these two men Regemmelech and Sharezer trying to merely \u0026ldquo;appease\u0026rdquo; God?# Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king\u0026rsquo;s spokesman. If this is the same man, perhaps he had some governmental authority.# Bethel has a history of idolatry. It was at Bethel that Jeconiah set up a calf to be worshipped so that the people would not go down to Jerusalem to worship.# Zechariah 7:3a speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain,# Zechariah 7:3b as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; This was something they had practiced over and over every year, every time the date come up.# Perhaps they might have taken note of the prophet Jeremiah\u0026rsquo;s conclusion as he lamented the destruction of Jerusalem. Though he was increadibly sad, his hope was in the Lord not on better days. Lamentations 5:21, 3:21-23# The second temple was destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus the Roman. It was destroyed on the 9th day of the 5th month which is the same day Nebuchadnezzar burned down the first temple in 586b.C.# Today the Jews commemorate this day with fasting and morning. Instead of returning to the Lord, the religious Jews want God to give them a temple so as to return their religious activities. No wonder God does not answer this prayer.# Message #1 - Addressing a wrong concept of repentance# Zechariah 7:4-5 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; Zechariah as priest and prophet receives the word of the Lord telling him communicate it to the people, including the priests.# Zechariah 7:4-5 When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years\u0026hellip; these fasts had been held for over 7 decades.# The fast of the fifth month was remembering when Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple was burned by Nebuchadnezzar in 586b.C. 2 Kings 25:8# The fast of the seventh month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to flee to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25# Fasts were also held in the fourth and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2# These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They were self-imposed by the people and held throughout the years of Babylonian captivity.# On the surface, the question being brought before the priests seems sincere. God\u0026rsquo;s answer through Zechariah will reveal a problem.# Perhaps many grew up practicing them and presumed they should just continue, not necessarily ever question why they got started in the first place.# Matthew 6:16 \u0026ldquo;Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.# Matthew 6:17 \u0026ldquo;But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face# Matthew 6:18 so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.# Their theological understanding of what repentance meant needed to be challenged. They were more upset about the effects than the cause. To them, a return meant mourning over the evil that resulted in order to make the good return.# Their concept of returning to God was an issue of how they were affected not what God said. The very reason they were taken out of the land was not a series of mishaps but because God had said their total disregard for Him would lead to their demise.# Isaiah 30:15 For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said, \u0026ldquo;In repentance and rest you shall be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength.\u0026rdquo; But you were not willing,# Through this series of 4 messages, God will show them the crisis in their thinking in order to pleade with this generation of post-exile jews to change their thinking and return to Him by faith.# 5. Zechariah 7:5b \u0026hellip;was it actually for Me that you fasted? perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting to commemorate the loss of the temple among others.# In the minds of the people, especially the younger generation, it was a practice they had always done. They grew up doing it. It was normal to do it. Perhaps if the question had been, \u0026ldquo;why do you fast?\u0026rdquo;, the answer would have been, \u0026ldquo;because we\u0026rsquo;ve always done so\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.# God goes beyond the initial why question and moves to a deeper level to make them question their level of sincerity, did you consider Me when doing it? Was it me you were after? Was I the intent of your heart?# They were missing the point by asking if they should continue or not. They seem to have the presumption that what they did was right. Somehow they appear to have believed that their fasting caused their return to the land.# So God makes them questions, why had they done it in the first place? Isaiah 58:3-8# motivation for these particular fastings were not for God. Neither did God ever tell them they should be done.# Certainly the ritualistic weeping had an appearance of spirituality. Surely God would be impressed and be moved to show mercy? Isaiah 39:13# To ask if they should continue the fasts when the temple is rebuilt is a little like staring at a photograph of a person, trying to remember you, while the real person sits next to you.# Today, Christians do things out of habit or even worse, because of habit in the name of God, thinking they must be done because they have been practiced for decades. Perhaps we should ask ourselves why we do what we do. Is it really for a deeper fellowship with God that we do it?# forgetting the reality behind the ritual is hanging on to an empty ritual. There is a mighty power in tradition to blind people from reality. Mark 7:13# One day in the future, all of Israel will weep, not for loosing out on some blessings or as a means to commemorate better days, but the day they realize it was them that had pierced their Deliverer and Messiah. Zechariah 12:10-14# 1) This is the day the nation of Israel will repent, they will change their minds and turn to God in faith to receive the forgiveness of sins through the finished work of Jesus the Messiah on the cross. Oh what a blessed day that will be! A glad reunion between a nation and their God.# One of the greatest misunderstandings of the Bible today centers around the understanding of what repentance is. In order to inspire what they consider to be repentance, many are teaching a Gospel of works. \u0026ldquo;Clean up your life and you will be saved\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;have you truly mourned for your sin?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;turn from your sin and be saved\u0026rdquo;.# What was needed for Israel to be restored? To return to God. A simple turning from what they were trusting in (idolatry) to once again trust God.# God is richly revealing His goodness, forbearance and long-suffering to lead people turn to Him. That is, to change their minds from what they are believing to believing in Him. Romans 2:4# Some teachings of \u0026ldquo;grace\u0026rdquo; essentially promote a sense of rebellion against the law of God. Grace is not contrary to the law, it is contrary to legalism. These false understandings end up promoting the believer with a license to sin.# Legalism seeks to find God\u0026rsquo;s favour either for justification or sanctification by means of law keeping. It is possible to see the Christian life as keeping with external morality, however God would question us, did you do it for Me?# Grace teaches us Christ as the means to walk with God. Grace gives us the correct motivation of a thankful heart.# In Christ the believer upholds and agrees with the law in, never rebelling against it.# On the contrary, God is never in favour of legalism. Legalism springs from self-righteousness and a complete misunderstanding of God\u0026rsquo;s perfect righteousness and man\u0026rsquo;s depravity.# The Christian is never encouraged to walk independent of God. Quite the opposite, God works all things together towards his/her utlimate good, for a life in total dependancy upon God. Isaiah 66:2, John 15:5, 19, Romans 8:32-33, Psalm 40:16-17# 6. Zechariah 7:6 \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? In a similar fashion to their fasting (ceasing from any food), eating and drinking is done without considering God but for mere physical supplement. We do it for self preservation.# Whether we eat or don\u0026rsquo;t eat makes little difference before God if our relationship with Him is estranged.# 6. Zechariah 7:7 \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# God says through Zechariah, I\u0026quot;m saying now what I said through prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos spoke to the previous generation. This generation was on their way to repeating exactly same thing. The circumstances might be different but the message is exactly the same.# The reason they were sent into exile in the first place, the reason the glorious days were over, was their own fault for not trusting the Lord. God had said through the prophets that it would happen if they did not listen.# a. Amos 4:6 \u0026ldquo;But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# b. Amos 4:7 \u0026ldquo;Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up.# c. Amos 4:8 \u0026ldquo;So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# d. Amos 4:9 \u0026ldquo;I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# e. Amos 4:10 \u0026ldquo;I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# f. Amos 4:11 \u0026ldquo;I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# This question demonstrates the way the people thought. They lamented over the consequences but had not learned why they lost it in the first place.# It did not seem to enter their minds that they were actually estranged with God. This really didn\u0026rsquo;t bother them. What bothered them is \u0026lsquo;keeping a good testimony\u0026rsquo;.# Their thinking dictated that if they would felt sorry enough, sad enough, if they truly lamented their condition, God would see them in their lamentable state and feel pity.# This is an example of a self-righteous approach and comes from a faulty understanding of God\u0026rsquo;s absolute righteousness. The only way to approach God is God\u0026rsquo;s way through God\u0026rsquo;s provision.# just like the fasting in those days was not for God, today\u0026rsquo;s Christian activities can be godless while having a certain spiritual look appeal to them. Colossians 2:20-23# Sermon 2 - Showing the cause; failure to walk by faith# 7. Zechariah 7:8-9 Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; God takes the nation back to a right perspective under the Mosaic law. They had willingly entered into this covenant with God.# If Israel kept the law, God would bless them. However, when Israel did not follow their part of the covenant, God was obligated to curse them.# The key thing to note is that failure to keep the Mosaic law was a given. God was not exiling them for failure to keep the law but rather for their failure to walk with Him in order to keep the law.# Failure to listen means they were so intent on keeping the law they failed to be instructed on how God meant them to carry it out. The law was really meant to show them inadequacy so they would look to Him as they failed, as they learned and grew closer and closer to God as a result.# This verse is not teaching in favour of modern day \u0026ldquo;social justice\u0026rdquo;. The law was in place to protect the oppressed, not to force \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; on everyone.# God shows the people they failed. They were not dispensing fairness, brotherly kindness and compassion. Failure to keep their agreement should have been cause to seek to restore it with the other party - in this case God.# Commandments 1-4 related to God, commandments 6-10 related to man.\na. Zechariah 7:10a and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; James, the epistle written to scattered Jews says, these are the marks of true religion. James 1:27# Empty rituals, morning lost benefits caused by ones own sin is just lamentable.# They were not only neglecting but oppressing the most vulnerable in the nation.# A stranger (GER) was a legal, non-jew living in the land. Ruth the Moabite, was an example of a stranger in the land.# b. Zechariah 7:10b and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; Their hearts were against one another therefore they devised evil. Proverbs 4:23# 8. Zechariah 7:11 \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. This served as an instruction to this generation. Refusing to listen to God comes at inevitable consequences.# Their indifference to God\u0026rsquo;s word is what caused the 70 year exile.# 9. Zechariah 7:12a \u0026ldquo;*They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts# Flint is a very hard stone used for cutting and piercing things. A heart like flint is one that is hard, calloused and cannot hear God\u0026rsquo;s word.# Notice these people hardened their hearts and as a result they came to a point of being deaf. They were deaf because they chose not to not because God never gave them the ability to hear.# This perhaps seems impossible but given time and a constant indifference to the conscience and to the hearing of God\u0026rsquo;s voice, one becomes cold, indifferent and far. To the extent that one becomes deaf. Jeremiah 22:21# Zechariah 7:12a had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; Acts 6:8-15# Zechariah is the first to record this doctrine of the Spirit. It was the Spirit that prompted the prophets to speak.# They refused to listen to the prophets, they refused to see their failure to keep the law and need to turn to God in faith. Acts 7:51-53# When Stephen reminded the first century Jews about this and they stoned him. Acts 7:54-60# Matt# 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. They did not keep the covenant, so in keeping with the agreement, the wrath of God came. Did they return to God when they realized this? Unfortunately no.# For over 1000 the Scriptures were warning them of this. Deuteronomy 28:49-50# It is easy to misunderstand God\u0026rsquo;s wrath is brought on due to His relationship being cut off with His people. It is a faith issue, not perfection issue.# When God\u0026rsquo;s people don\u0026rsquo;t walk as they should, that is, trusting in Him, in His ways, listening to what He has to say, then God will turn to other methods to capture the attention of His people.# 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; God reverses the situation. For countless times God has been calling to them, now they get to see what it\u0026rsquo;s like when God doesn\u0026rsquo;t listen.# A relationship implies communication between each other. God had been speaking to the people but the people did not want to listen to Him. The communication was broken and the relationship suffered.# While the people seemed to be fine without God, they ignored him. When troubles came however, they called out to God for help and in turn, God did not listen to them.# Would they miss the point of God\u0026rsquo;s not answering their call?# Was God playing \u0026ldquo;the silent game\u0026rdquo; with them because He was being querulous?# Did they call out to God because they realized they needed God or because they wanted to be freed of the situation?# If God had helped them get what they desired, would it have helped the relationship?# 11. Zechariah 7:14a \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. God\u0026rsquo;s ways are perfect. He was wanted their ultimate good, since they were not in a condition to listen, He sent them into different directions where they were no longer together in the land.# Since they wanted to be like the rest of the nations, God does exactly that. He scatters them to the nations. 1 Samuel 8:5# So much of Israel\u0026rsquo;s custom revolved around the land, Jerusalem and the temple. These were given to them by God and could serve them as reminders of who He was. Yet now, in a strange land they had nothing except God. Would they turn to God to trust Him?# Storm Wind Ezekiel 1:4# Zechariah 7:14b Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;# The land was made to rest. Rest from Israel\u0026rsquo;s abuse to it but mostly, God removed them away from the land so by being alone in a strange land they might turn to God in faith.# The point being made is clear. The reason they were exiled, the reason Jerusalem and the temple was destroyed was due to their incapacity to keep the covenant agreement, not because they had not kept a certain self-appointed fast.# It\u0026rsquo;s good that the priests had to be receiving this message too. They were a major part of the problem and their teaching needed to encourage a return to the Lord.# In light of this, their question seems so very insignificant and it should encourage these men from Bethel and anyone else to repent, change their minds, return to the Lord.# B. Zechariah 8:1-23 - 10 promises concerning Jerusalem# 1-8 future laid out\n9 -13 - get busy rebuilding\n14-15 - trust in God\u0026rsquo;s promises\n16-17 - go back to the mosaic covenant\n1. Message #3 - Promises 1-7# 1. Promise #1, The Lord will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem# a. Zechariah 8:1-2 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; Zechariah 1:14-16# Zion is used many times interechangeably with Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 5:7, Isaiah 40:9, Psalm 87:2-3# Zion can also refer to the people of Israel. Isaiah 60:14, Isaiah 52:1# Hebrews used Zion in a figurative sense to speak of the New Jerusalem. Hebrews 12:22# God is exceedingly jealous for Zion.# It would appear in this context that Zion is used as the Holy Mountain. Zion here seems more specific than just Jerusalem, it is mount Zion where Jesus will reign and be worshipped.# Zechariah 1:14, Psalm 2:6, Psalm 132:13, Ezekiel 16\nb. Zechariah 8:3a \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the only city that God says He will make his holy habitation. This will come about during the Millenial Kingdom.# 2. Zechariah 8:3 Promise #2, Jerusalem will be called the city of truth# a. Zechariah 8:3b Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,# b. Zechariah 8:3c and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; The city of Jerusalem is not this way today.# Revelation 11:8 - \u0026ldquo;Sodom in Egypt\u0026rdquo; during the tribulation.# 3. Zechariah 8:4-6 Promise #3, Jerusalem will have complete peace and safety# a. Zechariah 8:4-5 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; The elderly and the young (the most vulnerable people groups) will be safe and will not be afraid.# Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem to the ground leaving the young and the old lying on the ground. This is what this generation had seen. God says he will turn it around. Lamentations 2:21# Restoration from the exile:4. Promise #4, God will gather the Jews from the east and the west and bring them back to Jerusalem\nb. Zechariah 8:6 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.# When God announces restoration it may seem improbable but that is what is going to happen. Genesis 18:14\na. Zechariah 8:7-8a \u0026ldquo;*Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; *# Obviously east and west implies more than just Babylon. This is a worldwide return.\nand I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; Physical restoration. This sets the stage for discipline during the Tribulation. 2 Peter 3:10# 5. Promise #5, The Jews will once again be those who reflect God unto the peoples of the earth (they will be God\u0026rsquo;s people). God will work with Israel once again.# a. Zechariah 8:8b and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; This is more than just a physical return, this is when Israel will return to the Lord! Isaiah 66:8, Zechariah 12:10# This sets the stage for the blessings of the Millenial Kingdom.# Under the Mosaic covenant, Israel would be God\u0026rsquo;s special people among the nations if they kept their part. That is, they would be a nation who reflected God and God would bless them before the Gentile nations.# This is why while the Jews are in exile they are not God\u0026rsquo;s nation. They do not reflect God as a nation nor do we see God blessing them in the land of promise.# This in no way affects the Abrahamic covenant given 600 years prior that declared them as a nation to be God\u0026rsquo;s posession. This was an unconditional covenant and promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants.# So even though the Jews are in exile, they are still his people and His promises to them still hold true.# Exodus 19:5 \u0026lsquo;Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;# Though Israel had not walked with God, there would be a time when Israel could be counted as the people of God among the nations if they kept the covenant conditions. This will come about because God will give them a new heart and the Spirit of God will dwell in them to empower them to walk as they should.# b. Zechariah 8:9 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, God was offering them the strength yet they were to let Him.# Zechariah 8:9 you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. pay attention to the prophets who told you to get busy rebuilding the temple. Two of these were Zechariah and Haggai. Zechariah 2:12, Ezra 5:1, 6:14# a. Zechariah 8:10 \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. There were political, economical problems. Haggai 1:3-6# They worked hard and yet had no wages. God had caused the political and economical problems.# b. Zechariah 8:11 \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.# God has changed his disposition. The current group would have a very different treatment if they returned to HIm.# 6. Promise #6, The land will be a blessing and yield fruit# a. Zechariah 8:12a \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; Deuteronomy 28:1-14 Quoting by way of blessing if they went back tothe Mosaic covenant. Matthew 6:33# Israel had experienced times of cursing in the land, times of discipline away from the land. This speaks of a time of great blessing in the land.# b. Zechariah 8:12b and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.# Notice how God is actively making this to come about. Believing Israel \u0026ldquo;the remnant\u0026rdquo; will have as an inheritance off these things. Not by their doing or by their obedience but because God causes it to come to pass for those who believe in Him.# In other words, God is saying that when they were focused on their homes, econbnomy, politics, etc God made it harder for them. HOwever, now as they focus on the temple, God would supply all their needs in abundance. Matthew 6:33# 7. Promise #7, Israel will become a blessing to the nations# a. Zechariah 8:13 \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing.# Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; Do not fear, trust me! This reminder is listed 365 times in the Bible. How do you stop being afraid? Trust God\u0026rsquo;s promises. Zechariah 8:14-15# Again he says, let you hand be strong. In other words, trust me, let me strengthen you!# In just the same way that Israel has been a stigma among the Gentile nations, God will turn it around. He will reunite the houses (people) of Judah and Israel. They will be one nation under God. He will deliver them and they will no longer be a curse but a blessing to the other nations.# God told them this so that they would take courage. They could find strength in this future promise.# trust in promises 14-15# b. Zechariah 8:14-15 \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented,. God purposed to bring harm against His people. Why? Because God relentlessly held them to the covenant they had entered into with God. God never quit upholding His part.# God disciplines those He loves. He is relentless because he loves his people. Hebrews 12:5# so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! With that same relentless passion, God says he has purposed to do good to the city of Jerusalem and His people. Malachi 3:8-11, Jeremiah 29:11# Just like there were clauses regarding cursing in the covenant, there were clauses regarding obedience that resulted in blessings. Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 26# Once again, he reiterates, do not fear. God says, \u0026ldquo;when you trust me, you have nothing to fear!\u0026rdquo; Proverbs 28:1,# In a similar sense, for the church age, we have nothing to fear when we trust God! 2 Timothy 1:7# Heart sins = Zechariah 8:16-17 - based on what has been previously discussed, God says, rather than focussing on morning, they should go back to keeping the covenant.# a. Zechariah 8:16 \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment# Because of who they were, because of their association with God as a people, the natural course of action should be to reflect God in their dealings with one another.# They as a community should be truth tellers within the assembly of the believing.# They were to be people of judgment. They should make judgments according to truth. Deuteronomy 13:1-5,# We aren\u0026rsquo;t to judge regarding people\u0026rsquo;s motives. And we aren\u0026rsquo;t to judge hypocritically. Matthew 7:1-6# for peace in your gates. They were to be people who promote peace. Primarily with each other.# b. Zechariah 8:17 \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, Zechariah 7:10# Heart sins: These are sins committed in the heart.# beware! private thoughts will eventually lead to public actions. Proverbs 4:23# 500 years before Jesus, Zechariah was instructing against heart sins. Matthew 5-7# Zechariah 8:17 and do not love perjury;\u0026rdquo; Loving to lie is something the Lord detests. False weights are an example of what this is talking about. Jeremiah 5:30-31# The treatment they had for eachother was reflective of who they had as God. Love for one another and being honest were two key points in the Mosaic covenant.# Swearing by God\u0026rsquo;s name and lying were probably strategies of business learned from their time in Babylon. They went from farming to commerce. They learned to take advantange of their neighbour (telling them untruths) and used God (using God\u0026rsquo;s name in vain) to legitimize business. Matthew 5:33-37# These two sum up the two aspects of the law. 4 laws were regarding their relationship with God and 6 dealt with their interaction with fellow man.# This did not reflect God\u0026rsquo;s ways established for Israel.# In regards to false prophets, though they are more at fault, it does not mean the people were innocent. The people wanted to hear things they liked. If the people would judge according to truth, false teaching would dry up.# In a similar way today, there would be no business for false teachers if the people of God would judge according to truth.# for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD. God is a God who loves, but He says there are things He hates.# hauty eyes, lying tongue (perjury), hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness (perjury), one who spreads strife among the brothers (seek peace).# Jesus also is quoted saying he hates the sin of the nicolaitans. This was something that a group of people were teaching. Possibly a teaching that promoted laity-clergy distinction. Revelation 2:6# Message #4 - Fasting will become joy, gladness and cheerful feasts# 8. Promise #8, God will turn their mourning into gladness# a. Zechariah 8:18-19a *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months\u0026hellip;*Four fasts were held every year conmemorating the byproduct of their sin.# Religion thrives on ceremony. The greater the number of rituals, the higher the religion.# Religion must of needs highlight the problem but only the God of the Bible provides full and complete restitution by grace.# Zechariah 8:19b \u0026hellip;will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; The pharisees walked around with sad faces because that was the image of spirituality.# True spirituality is God\u0026rsquo;s complete provision in Christ. One response is characteristic to Him who experiences the spirituality that comes from Christ - turns mourning into joy, gladness and cheerful feasting! Psalm 30:11,# Israel will one day experience this with God, when by faith they return to Him. Zephaniah 3:14-20# a. Zechariah 8:19b so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; Rather than focusing on mourning their losses, they should focus on loving truth and peace.# The nations of the world seek peace. Yet it is at the cost of truth. Unless there is true justice, truth divides, therefore the nations of the world are willing to do away with truth to establish \u0026ldquo;world unity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;peace\u0026rdquo;*.# 9. Promise #9, Gentiles will pour into Jerusalem to seek God\u0026rsquo;s favor# a. Zechariah 8:20 Thus says the LORD of hosts,\u0026rsquo; It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities.# This prophesies a crowd coming from cities will come. Honor and popularity will be returned to Jerusalem as the capital. There will be unity among the people. Israel and Judah will be united as one nation. The cities speaks of the cities of Israel.# Reason of exaltation# a. Zechariah 8:21 \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; We see the urgency of going, \u0026ldquo;let us go at once\u0026rdquo; to seek the favour of the Lord.# This is how the conversation had began\u0026hellip;they were seeking the favour of the Lord.# The people don\u0026rsquo;t go to see a statue or buy an idol but to seek the favor of the Lord and seek Him.# Location of the exaltation# b. Zechariah 8:22 \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; The people of many nations come to Jerusalem. The fulfilment of this will be when Jesus is reigning in the city of Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:16-18# Why do people come to go to Jerusalem? Because that is where Jesus is.# 10. Promise #10, The Jew will be seen as a blessing to the Gentiles# Preeminence of city of Jerusalem# a. Zechariah 8:23 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is Israel being God\u0026rsquo;s people and God being their God.# In the kingdom, 10 gentiles will grab the garment of one jew to ask him to take them to Jerusalem to seek the Lord.# The center of the world will be Jerusalem because Jesus will be there. Isaiah 49:22-23, Deuteronomy 28:13# God\u0026rsquo;s blessing upon the jews will be undeniable. People of all nations will recognize the God of the Jews and seek to find favor with Him through the access available to the Jew.# This was God\u0026rsquo;s purpose with the nation of Israel from the beginning. They were to be a light unto the Gentiles. They were to be a vessel of pointing the way to God.# Interestingly, after Satan is released from the abyss after 1000 years, he immediately attacks Jerusalem. Revelation 20:9# These future promises were to encourage the returnees in the present.# The church also has many wonderful promises for the future which are to impress on us in the present.# Zechariah 9:1-14:21 - The Fourth Message: The Two Burdens# Zechariah 9:1-11:17 The Burden concerning the Gentiles nations and offering up the Kingdom of God# The following 5 chapters were probably written at a later date of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s ministry.# Many skeptics have tried to discredit the authenticity of chapers 9-14 saying it is not the same author as the first 8 chapters. However these arguments are untenable and can be refuted.# Difference of style is not a conclusive argument for different authorship because style of writing can change with different circumstances.# Chapters 9-11 have to do with foretelling how God will come to Israel in the person of Jesus Christ and offering them to return to Him and set up His kingdom. They will reject Messiah and his offer.# Chapters 9 and 10 prophetically explain the time period when Israel was subjugated under Greece.# Chapter 11 foretells when she is under Roman domination.# Chapters 12-14 have to do with foretelling how God will not postpone the promised blessings due to Israel\u0026rsquo;s return to the Lord.# Like the prodigal son returned back to his father, we are told so too Israel as a nation will one day return wholeheartedly to their God through faith in Jesus Christ as Messiah.# Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, \u0026ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rdquo;# Israel rejected this offer but out of that rejection God will create a new administration inclusive of the Gentiles.# During this time, God will not work around one nation but through a new assembly, an organism composed of Jews and Gentiles known as The Church of Jesus Christ. Romans 9:25-29# God temporarily changed his focus from buidling a nation to building a spiritual gathering because of Israel\u0026rsquo;s persistent unbelief. Romans 9:30-33# The Jews that believe during the timeframe of the Church are included in the Church. Sadly, by and large Jews continue rejecting to return to the Lord.# 1 Peter 2:25 For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.# Though Israel as a nation rejected their Messiah, Like a loving father, God continues working circumstances throughout history towards Israel\u0026rsquo;s future return.# God is a God who is tied to keep his Word.# Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!\u0026hellip;For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15\nBurden #1 contains three chapters.# Chapter 9 - hymn# Chapter 10 - Messiah rejected# Chaper 11 - False shepherd# Verses 1-8 judgment on oppresive nations surrounding Israel using Alexander the Great. Then comes Messiah unlike Alexander, he was a humble man.# 300 years before Jesus came, God will use a Macedonian king named Alexander the Great to judge surrounding nations. The Greek language and culture became popularized throughout the world. This will set the scene for Messiah\u0026rsquo;s arrival.# Zecharia 9:1-6 A Hymn of Divine Conquest and Protection# Zechariah 9:1-8 Judgement of nations in the land, preparing the way for God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah.# After the battle of Issus in 333bC., Alexander the Great\u0026rsquo;s conquered from north to south beginning at Syria, Phoenicia and then Philistia.# Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of Syria.# Tyrus and Sidon are principal cities of Phoenicia# Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of Philistia.# Zechariah 9:1a The burden of the word of the LORD# Generally speaking, a burden is something God puts on somebody\u0026rsquo;s heart. 1 Corinthians 9:16, Jeremiah 20:9# The word burden (MASSA) in conection to prophecy should be understood as a catastrophic judgment imposed on the prophet to be discharged with a sense of urgency. Zechariah 12:1, Malachi 1:1, Isaiah 13:1# Zechariah 9:1b is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place\u0026hellip; uncertain. Hadrach (Chadrak) is a syrian deity. This city no longer exists but has been identified as existing between Hamath and Aleppo.# a. Damascus means a well-watered land in Syriac.# Zechariah 9:1 (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD).# This verse could also be translated \u0026ldquo;for the Lord has his eyes upon men and upon the tribes of Israel\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Zechariah 1:8,# The Lord sees all and takes into account everything and executes judgment and blessing accordingly. Zechariah 9:8, Proverbs 15:3# Zechariah 9:2a And Hamath also, which borders on it; Amos 6:2, 2 Kings 25:18-21# Zechariah 9:2b Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. Cities in the land of Lebanon. The king of Tyre serves as a type or an example of Satanic force behind a king. Ezekiel 28:12-17# Though Tyre and Sidon are wise, it will not save them.# These cities were wise in their own eyes. Ezekiel 28:3-5, Proverbs 3:7# Zechariah 9:3 For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Their trust was in economic power. Their wealth was piled up. James 5:3# This fortress of wealth will not defend them. Her trust (build herself) is in piled up riches.# Zechariah 9:4 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Behold, the Lord enters into action. The Lord will use Alexander the Great to plunder Tyre.# Tyre was an important commercial city with a great port that was thought to be impossible to conquer.# The Assyrians laid siege against Tyre for five years but never conquered the city.# Nebuchadnezzar tried to conquer Tyre for 13 years# Within 7 months, Alexander took the city and burned it to the ground.# The nations saw this and feared. Ezekiel 27# Zechariah 9-5-7 - Philistia es dealt with# Zechariah 9:5a Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. One of five main Philistine cities. Joshua 13:3, 1 Samuel 6:17# It was Ashkelon that historically caused God\u0026rsquo;s people to be afraid.# “see it and be afraid” in Hebrew is a play on words, TERE and TIRA.# Zechariah 9:5b Gaza too will writhe in great pain; She inflicted pain on Israel, now she will suffer pain.# Zechariah 9:5c Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. We are uncertain what her expectation was but God takes it away.# Zechariah 9:5d Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza,# Zechariah 9:5e and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.# Zechariah 9:6a And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, God destroyed the cities and people and mixed them with a hybrid people. It may have been Alexander’s policy to mix the conquered peoples with each other.# Zechariah 9:6b And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. Jeremiah 25:20, Amos 1:6-8, Zephaniah 2:4-7# 1 Peter 5:5, Proverbs 16:18\nZechariah 9:7-\nZechariah 9:7 And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Philistine paganism involved drinking blood. It refers to idolatry.# Zechariah 9:7b Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, This appears to be saying there will be a remnant of believers among the Philistines. Ezekiel 33:25# Zechariah 9:7c And Ekron like a Jebusite. When David conquered Jerusalem the Jebusites inhabited the city. David let them live and they were incorporated into Israel, Ekron will be same. 2 Samuel 24:16, 1 Chronicles 21:18# Zechariah 9:8 But I will camp around My house because of an army, While God is judging the surrounding nations, He is also protecting Israel, Jerusalem and the temple.# This is probably referring more to the protection of his people, Israel though all are ultimately included.# Zechariah 9:8 My house By this time the temple had been standing for about 200 years.# Zechariah 9:8 Because of him who passes by and returns; This was fulfilled about 200 years later in 333b.C. when Alexander refrained from destroying Jerusalem.# According to the historian Josephus, after Alexander took Gaza he made his way quickly to Jerusalem. When the high-priest heard this he ordered that the people should cry out to God and ask for protection.19# At that time the high priest had a dream where he was told to take courage, adorn the city and open the gates and that the rest appear in white garments and that all the priests should wear their priestly garments.19# According to the dream the priest acted entirely, and waited for Alexander. When Alexander saw them, everybody was in white and the high priest in purple, he approached by himself and fell before him.# Later on, when asked why he had adored the priest, Alexander said, \u0026ldquo;I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit\u0026hellip;and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind.\u0026rdquo;19# Zechariah 9:8 And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Zechariah 9:1, Jeremiah 16:17, Isaiah 60:18, Ezekiel 28:24# Zechariah 9:9 - Zechariah Describes the Messiah\nZechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! This is perhaps the most known verse of Zechariah. It was fulfilled during Palm Sunday about 2000 years ago, 500 years after it was written.# Zechariah 9:9a Behold, your king is coming to you; 500 years prior, Zechariah announced the coming of melech Yisrael! For Israel to have a king meant political sovereignty and deliverance from the oppression of vassal nations.# Judah was overthrown by Babylon and taken into captivity. When they returned, they were subject to the whims of the Medo-Persians. Even though Zerubbabel was in the direct line of David, he was not king. This confirms Coniah\u0026rsquo;s curse. Luke 3:27, Matthew 1:12, Jeremiah 22:30# God wanted a king for Israel. He just had a certain kind of king in mind, not the kind Israel desired.# God wanted a king that was unlike pagan nations. A king that was just, righteous, faithful and good, one who recognized God as sovereign and he would act as earthly regent. Deuteronomy 17:14-20# An important phase in the historical development of Israelite kingship was Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s promise, delivered through the Prophet Nathan, that the Davidic dynasty would remain forever. 2 Samuel 7:8–16, 1 Chronicles 17:7–14; Psalm 87 88:3–5, 20–38# This assertion was the basis of future eschatological hopes for a new kingdom and an ideal king, and in this regard also Israelite kingship differed radically from the kingship patterns of Egypt and Mesopotamia.20# The king the people wanted was like the other nations. 1 Samuel 8:4-6# Zechariah 9:9b He is just and endowed with salvation, a just king equipped with deliverance!# Salvation is spiritual peace with God. Isaiah 45:21, 53:11, Jeremiah 23:5-6, Malachi 4:2# Why wasn\u0026rsquo;t the kingdom established upon His first visitation?# It was not because they did not enthrone the Messiah. No! John 6:15, Romans 9:33# In fact, He did not permit them to enthrone Him by force.# In order for Him to reign as their Messiah King, they needed to return to the Lord first! Jeremiah 24:7, Malachi 3:7, 2 Chronicles 7:14# It is not the people of Israel who enthone the Messiah but God will do so over his enemies. Psalm 110:1# Zechariah 9:9 is part of a larger unit that anticipates a time in which the people of Yahweh’s perennial adversaries will be pacified and humiliated and Philistia incorporated within it (9:1-8). The king whose advent Jeremiah (23:5, etc.) and Ezekiel (34:23-31, etc.) also looked forward to is described according to ideal specifications. He will be strong to save and lowly and unassuming at the same time (9:9)21# Zechariah 9:9c Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Unlike Alexander, God in human flesh came to earth and chose to be born in a manger and rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. Luke 2:7# Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding a horse like Alexander the Great?# There are over 188 mentions of horses in the Bible. It may surprise you to know that Israel was not supposed to have horses.# The reason that Israel never was allowed horses is expressly stated in the second giving of the law.# Deuteronomy 17:15-16a you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses\u0026hellip;“But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:# God had told the Israelite kings or the people not to have horses so that they would not be prone to return once again to Egypt. Egypt was the primary provider of horses at the time.# Deuteronomy 17:16b forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, ‘Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.’”# When God delivered Israel from Egypt, he wanted them to make a clean break and that they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any reason to ever want to return. If Israel was not to return to Egypt, they must not trade with Egypt in any form.# When the the decalog prohibits covetting, it does not mention horses yet it names oxen and donkeys. Surely horses are would be more desireable than donkeys\u0026hellip;# Exodus 20:17 \u0026ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor\u0026rsquo;s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\u0026rdquo;# Archeological digs have found that all the nations in the area had horses but not Israel, that is, not until the time of Solomon in 970b.C. and that was out of disobedience. 1 Kings 10:26# Years later when King Solomon disobeyed and aquired horses that is exactly what ocurred\u0026hellip;# 1Kings 10:28 Also Solomon\u0026rsquo;s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king\u0026rsquo;s merchants procured them from Kue for a price. 1 Kings 10:26-29# Knowing this fact, Psalm 20 verses 7 through 9 make a lot more sense.# Psalm 20:7 Some boast in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.# Psalm 20:8 They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright.# Psalm 20:9 Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.# God did not want the people of Israel to conquer the land trusting in horses and chariots but in God. Zechariah 10:5# David conquered the land on foot. Therefore David\u0026rsquo;s triumphs are really a testimony that God conquered the land for them. Psalm 18:39-50# Proverbs 21:31, “The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but deliverance is of the Lord.”# When the people returned they brought with them 736 horses. This speaks of the people\u0026rsquo;s condition after 70 years in a foreign land. The adopted new practices from teh Chaldeans. Ezra 2:66, Nehemiah 7:68# Therefore, in humility, in keeping with the law and in trusting the Father, Jesus the king entered Jerusalem riding on what is possibly a fine-bread donkey. What a magnificent entrance in keeping with everything God is and does!# Jesus made no exceptions when dealing with Himself in His first coming. He came under the law not to rebel against it but to fulfill it.# All four gospels state this verse is fulfilled upon the triumphal entering into Jerusalem. Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19# Matthew 21:1 And when they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,# Matthew 21:2 saying to them, \u0026ldquo;Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them, and bring them to Me.# Matthew 21:3 \u0026ldquo;And if anyone says something to you, you shall say, \u0026lsquo;The Lord has need of them,\u0026rsquo; and immediately he will send them.\u0026rdquo;# Matthew 21:4 Now this took place that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,# Matthew 21:5 \u0026ldquo;SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, \u0026lsquo;BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# Matthew 21:6 And the disciples went and did just as Jesus had directed them,# Matthew 21:7 and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them their garments, on which He sat.# Matthew 21:8 And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and spreading them in the road.# Matthew 21:9 And the multitudes going before Him, and those who followed after were crying out, saying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!\u0026rdquo;# While on the outskirts of town people followed Jesus crying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, many in the city of Jerusalem had no idea who He was.# Matthew 21:10 And when He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, \u0026ldquo;Who is this?\u0026rdquo;. Matthew 21:1-10# Matthew 21:15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David,\u0026rdquo; they became indignant, Clearly the religious leaders had no small part in keeping the people confused regarding the identity of the coming King.# The people wanted political peace. When the leaders of Israel realized that they had better chances of getting political peace with Rome then they yelled, \u0026ldquo;we have no king but Caesar\u0026rdquo;.# The people stumbled over Jesus. The kingdom of God is more than mere politics. Entrance to the Kingdom requires absolute righteousness. This was Jesus\u0026rsquo; offer to them. Matthew 5-7# Zechariah 9:10 Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. This prophecy is not unique to Zechariah. It is aluded to back in Genesis 49.# Genesis 49:10 \u0026ldquo;The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler\u0026rsquo;s staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.# Genesis 49:11 \u0026ldquo;He ties his foal to the vine, And his donkey\u0026rsquo;s colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes.# reveals Christ\u0026rsquo;s lowliness in outward condition as well as His inward disposition. The donkey is seen as the animal of peace. Genesis 49:11# The four Gospels include this event.\nMark 11:7 They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it.\nLuke 19:35 They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.\nJohn and Matthew make a point of quoting this passage in Zechariah\u0026hellip;\nJohn 12:14 Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written,\nJohn 12:15 \u0026ldquo;FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY\u0026rsquo;S COLT.\u0026rdquo;\nMatthew 21:4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet:\nMatthew 21:5 \u0026ldquo;SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, \u0026lsquo;BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nZechariah 9:10-10:12 - Zechariah announces The Kingdom to be established upon the acceptance of their king# The people of Israel had suffered for hundreds of years under the oppresive hands of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medo-Persians, under Greece and upon the Kings arrival, they were under Rome\u0026rsquo;s oppresive rule.# Zechariah 9:10-10:12 The Messiah\u0026rsquo;s offer\u0026hellip;Since Israel rejected their Messiah on his first visit, these promises were postponed until the second coming.# Zechariah 9:10a I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim\u0026hellip; Ephraim here represents the land of the northern kingdom of Israel. Genesis 48:8-22# The chariot was almost exclusively used in battle. Since Israel didn\u0026rsquo;t have chariots, this refers to the removal of war caused by gentile peoples in the land of Israel. Leviticus 26:6, Joshua 9:15# Zechariah 9:10b And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; Jesus will return as a conqueror going out to war then bring in peace. Psalm 72:8# This may be what the Horseman on the red horse in chapter one is willing to go and do. Just like the patrol returned saying there was peace on the earth while Israel suffered, now, the Angel of the Lord, The Messiah himself will go out against the nations that went against Israel and bring in true lasting peace upon the whole earth. Zechariah 1:8-17# Isaiah 2:4 And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.# The United Nations has tried to appropriate this verse taking on a Messianic role. Ironically, there have been more than 150 wars since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. This is far from bringing in peace.# It was through a series of battles that Jacob had acquired posession of the land and it has been battle after battle for Israel ever since.# This would bring great hope to a people who have experienced war since they arrived on the land. This will happen when God\u0026rsquo;s King, the Messiah will reign, He will speak peace to the nations.# peace is the word shalom.\nJesus will put down all warfare and strife. The chariot, the horse and the battle bow as representing weapons of warfare. he will remove all these and bring in world Shalom.# Jesus came in humility, for a time He stooped down lower than the angels, became a man, offered himself as God\u0026rsquo;s humble yet sufficient sacrificial provision for Israel\u0026rsquo;s true return, His offer was peace, true peace, eternal peace with God.# Zechariah 9:10c And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.# Earth is the word (ERETS) which could be translated land, however since the definite article is not in the Hebrew we understand it is not referring to the land of Israel but rather the earth, referring to a world wide kingdom. Psalm 72:8, Psalm 22:27-28# When Jesus comes to the earth, he will bring world peace in justice and truth. To be specific Jesus will reign from sea to sea.# John says that in the eternal state there is no sea, this therefore must be speaking of a future reign after Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time and before the eternal state.# We know this will be fulfilled during the 1000 Millenial Kingdom which is after the Tribulation and before the eternal state. Revelation 20:4-6# The entire time period between Zechariah 9:9 and 9:10 was previously unseen by Old Testament prophets.# Today, thanks to Paul\u0026rsquo;s teachings, we know it to be the church age. 1 Peter 1:10-11# This is why the Qumram arrived at the conclusion that there would be two Messiahs. Their names were Ben-Joseph and the second Messiah would be Ben-David. They believed there would be two different Messiahs. Why? Because they did not have Paul\u0026rsquo;s writings explaining the mysetery of the church.# Isaiah 9:6a For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; This portion was fulfilled on the first coming, but the second part of the verse has over 2000 years in between.# The second portion of the prophecy in this verse has yet to be fulfilled\u0026hellip;# Isaiah 9:6b And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.# Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# Today God is using the church to cause the Jews to be jealous of what they missed on Christ\u0026rsquo;s first coming. Romans 11:11, 14# The church will spend 7 years in Heaven. However, then they (the church) will reign upon the earth\u0026hellip;this is a literal 1000 year reign on the earth from Jerusalem.# Revelation 5:10 \u0026ldquo;And Thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.\u0026rdquo;# Verses 11-17 - The Maccabean victory -protection given from Antiochus IV# Zechariah 9:11a As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you,\u0026hellip; In order for a covenant to be firm, it had to be ratified in blood. Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 26:28, Psalm 105:7-11# Previously we saw a covenant to the peoples which dealt with God\u0026rsquo;s holding the nations at bay so as to not allow them to completely anhilate the people of Israel.# This covenant however is far greater in its scope and fulfillment. It is referring to a covenant God made to Abraham. Genesis 15:9-12, 18-20,# This is a description of the wonderful things God will do for Israel because of his promise to her. Israel, like no other nation in the world has a covenant that God made with them. Genesis 5:9-10# When a covenant was made, customarily, both parties passed between the the parts of cut up animals. While they walked through the parties would declare that the same should happen to them if they break their covenant.# When God made a covenant to Abraham. It was a special ceremony because God did it with himself while Abraham slept. Therefore, the picture is that God made the unilateral covenant without any involvement or requirement on behalf of Israel, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants.# God made many covenants throughout Scripture. They all kept a similar pattern. God promised he would make it. Then he ratified it. Then he clarified it. Then he fulfilled it.# Ezekiel 36:22 end time regathering was undeservedly. God was being faithful to Himself. He always keeps his word. Specifically the promise he made to Abraham.# Zechariah 9:11b \u0026hellip;I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit... Luke 16:24, restoration of those still in Babylon because of his covenant with them.# Cisterns without water were used as prisons. Genesis 37:24, Jeremiah 38:6# One cannot get out of a waterless pit unless someone rescues you. Genesis 37:23-28# waterless pit - Joseph, jeremiah, daniel, Psalm 40# Zechariah 9:12a Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope;# God had made them rest the land. Every seven years the people were to trust God to provide while they rested the land. Since they did not trust the Lord, the kept farming the land even on the seventh year\u0026hellip;they did this for 70 seventh years. Therefore the Lord took them out of the land, one year for every seventh year the land wasn\u0026rsquo;t given rest.# 2Ch 36:21 to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until seventy years were complete.# Leviticus 26:34 \u0026lsquo;Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies\u0026rsquo; land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.# Leviticus 26:35 \u0026lsquo;All the days of its desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it.# Zechariah 9:12b This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. When God gets you out of the pit, he promises to make up double. Isaiah 61:7# Job was granted double after his trials. Job did not know what God was going to do. Job 42# Exodus 12:17 \u0026lsquo;You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.# Daniel 8:21-25, 11:23-35# Zechariah 9:13-17 Macabean War - feast of dedication/festival of lights. John 10:22-24# Zechariah 9:13a For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. This image of a bow and arrow refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together as God\u0026rsquo;s bow and arrow in battle.# Zechariah 9:13b And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece;# Times of the Gentiles:# Babylon 605-539 b.C.# Medo-Persia - 539-331b.C.# Greece - 331-64b.C.# If Zechariah lived in the 500\u0026rsquo;s bC. how could Zechariah have seen the Grecian era? Daniel 10:20# The reference of greece is no problem if you believe God knows the future.# Zechariah 9:13c-14a And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them,# Zechariah 9:14b And His arrow will go forth like lightning;# This is a type of How the Lord will come at the end of the tribulation. Matthew 24:27# And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, This is not the rapture at the last trump. God has more than one trumpet sound. THis is for Israel.# And will march in the storm winds of the south.# storm winds of the south - God has been known to create the whirlwinds. Job 1:19# The Jewish people threw off the bonds of Antiochus iV for about 100 years. Zechariah 9:11# Zechariah 9:15a The LORD of hosts will defend them. God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord of Hosts, is he who is ready to go to battle for them. Psalm 27:10# Zechariah 9:15a And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; no weapon formed against God will prosper. Isaiah 54:17# rather these peoples will become stones in the crown of the King.# Zechariah 9:15a And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine;# Zechariah 9:15a And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,# Zechariah 9:15a Drenched like the corners of the altar.# Zechariah 9:16a And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; Save here is not referring to salvation from the penalty of sin but rather it is saying that The Lord of Hosts will deliver them from their oppressors.# That day refers to this day, Hanukah serves as a type of the deliverance that will occur in the Tribulation.# This is the day of victory when the Jews will miraculously overthrow the diabolical reign of Antiochus Epiphanes 167b.C..# Zechariah 9:16b For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.# Zechariah 9:17a For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs!# These are the covenant blessings that will come to Israel when she returns to the Lord. Deuteronomy 28:1-14# Israel will no longer be despised but will be an attractive nation. People will want what the Jews have.# Zechariah 9:17b Grain will make the young men flourish,# Zechariah 9:17c and new wine the virgins.# Zechariah 10:1-12 The True Shepherd# Zechariah 10:1a Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain - droughts on the land came about because of their wrong relationship with the Lord.# rain is simbolic of blessing or prosperity.# Spring is when they sow their seed. This is important to planting season. Joel 2:23# Zechariah 10:1b The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. why ask God for rain? Because he is the one who makes the clouds to rain. Job 36:27-28# Why would there be no rain? Because God has devised that people still need to trust in the King for their daily provision. This is a means to impress upon the people to depend on God. Jeremiah 14:22, Joel 2:23-27# Zechariah 10:2a For the teraphim speak iniquity,# The teraphim refers to many idols. They were household gods used for divination, probably shaped like human beings. Judges 17:4-5, 1 Samuel 19:13, 16# The idolatry in the land, the household idols came into their homes and people were looking to these idols for provision instead of God.# Zechariah 10:2a And the diviners see lying visions Deuteronomy 18:14, Jeremiah 27:9, Jeremiah 29:8, Micah 3:7# Zechariah 10:2a And tell false dreams; Jeremiah 23:32# Zechariah 10:2b They comfort in vain. Job 21:34, Jeremiah 6:13-14, Jeremiah 37:19# Zechariah 10:2b Therefore the people wander like sheep, Though they provide an immediate feeling of comfort, it is in vain because it was not based on reality. Acts 19:19# Zechariah 10:2c They are afflicted, As long as these people were clinging to this idolatry, they were wandering like sheep. Zechariah 11:7, Numbers 27:17, Ezekiel 34:5, Jeremiah 50:6,# Mattew 9:36 Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. Isaiah 61:1, Isaiah 49:13, Luke 19:10# Why consult God when I can get their palm read? It provided instant gratification.# Why consult God when I have a god for that? A god for every want.# The people were consulting demons or learning doctrines of demons and being \u0026lsquo;guided\u0026rsquo; by this.

Yet when this occurs, God will rescue them, He will get them from where they are and gather them to the land.# Zechariah 10:6b Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them,# God demonstrates his compassion with Israel even after their many rejections of Him.# Zechariah 10:6c For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.# Zechariah 10:7a \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad Ephraim was the son of Joseph but he was later adopted by Jacob to be one of the heirs.

The three shephers are removed within one month. Zechariah 10:3, Matthew 21:42-46# \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;These three shepherds are the Pharisees and Herodians, the Sadducees.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 22:15-16, Matthew 22:23, Matthew 22:34-3524# The context referrs to the first visitation of the Messiah and these three groups were religious leaders at that time.# During His first coming, these three groups set aside their differences in order to get rid of Jesus Christ.# In order to get the death penalty, they became allies with Rome.# When Rome destroyed the temple in the 5th month 70a.D. this may have been a death blow for these groups for selling out to the Romans.# According to the Mishnah, both temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av. This could hardly be seen as a coincidence.25# Zechariah 11:8 for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.

Not merely a covenant to the people (Israel) but to all the peoples (nations). Isaiah 56:6-7# \u0026ldquo;We aren\u0026rsquo;t told this specifically but by implication, God has made a covenant with the peoples of the earth in relation to His own people Israel.# One suggests, God has placed the nations under restraint lest they work Israel harm or ill.\u0026rdquo;26 Job 5:23, Ezekiel 34:25, Hosea 2:18, Genesis 12:3# Romans 15:8-9# It is commonly stated that the New Covenant is for the church. That cannot be for several reasons:# The New Covenant was promised to the house of Judah and the house of Israel. Jeremiah 31:31# The New Covenant conditions have not been met.# The New Covenant has not been fulfilled# The Church program has not replaced God\u0026rsquo;s program for Israel. God\u0026rsquo;s promises must be fulfilled with the nation of Israel in order to fulfill the many prophecies and, \u0026ldquo;then you will know I am the Lord\u0026rdquo;.# Regarding Israel\u0026hellip;the promise has not been broken, only postponed. And postponement is not abandonment with God. That is what Zechariah 14 shows.24# Zechariah 11:11a So it was broken on that day,# Zechariah 11:11b and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me\u0026hellip;the afflicted of the flock refers to the small number of believing Israel.# Zechariah 11:11c realized that it was the word of the LORD. John 8:28# Zechariah 11:12a I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; Matthew 26:15, Mark 14:10-11# Zechariah 11:12b but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.# The chief priests paid Judas Iscariot 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus. Matthew 26:14-16# Zechariah 11:13a Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, Zerubbabel is told to act this out in the temple and it sybolizes what actually will occur when Jesus is betrayed by Judas.# Zechariah 11:13b that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; Isaiah 53:3, Acts 4:11# Zechariah 11:13c So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. This was fulfilled when Judas returned the money to the chief priests and they in turn used it to buy a piece of land from the potter to use as a burial site for stranger. Matthew 27:3-7# This is the second temple (restored by Herod). This temple was to be destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus on the same day as Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the first temple in 586b.C.# Centuries earlier, just like Zechariah wrote these words, the prophet Jeremiah is quoted as having spoken the following\u0026hellip;# Matthew 27:9-10 \u0026hellip;AND THEY TOOK THE THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER, THE PRICE OF THE ONE WHOSE PRICE HAD BEEN SET by the sons of Israel; AND THEY GAVE THEM FOR THE POTTER\u0026rsquo;S FIELD, AS THE LORD DIRECTED ME.\u0026rdquo;# The imagery of clay in the hands of a potter is an illustration of how God can make vessels of blessing and vessels of wrath. It his prerogative. Jeremiah 18:1-12# While the chief priests were willing to pay 30 pieces of silver for the Messiah, God sacrificed His only Son. The chief priests arranged their payment in secret while God paid in plain view for everyone to see. The chief priests maintained their power but God maintained perfect righteousness.# Zechariah 11:14 Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union,# to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. With the rejection of the Shepherd comes the scattering of the sheep. A sheep without a shepherd will be prone to wander away not remain with together with the flock.# Shepherds had two rods. One to protect and one to pull out of danger.# Earlier the frist staff was broken. it was the staff that represents favor. 11:10# Now Zechariah breaks the second staff entitled unity. If Messiah would have been placed as king he would have reunited the kingdom. The tribes of the north and the tribes of the south would have been one again. 1 Kings 12, Jeremiah 31:31,# Zechariah said earlier messiah would come and unite the two kingdoms. Zechariah 10:6-8,# Ezekiel talks about two staffs coming together. This happens in the millenium.# Judah and Israel will only be united when the Messiah is their Shepherd and brings them back together.# Christ came in the name of the Father, He was not received. Another should come in his own name, and him the people would receive.27John 5:43# Land is wailing - Zechariah 11:1-3# flock is doomed.

Zechariah is asked to continue the charades but this time he was to change his apparel to impersonate a foolish shepherd.# Foolish means someone who does not take God into account. “The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God”” Psalm 14:1# Jesus said He was The Good Shepherd. He laid His life down for the sheep. John 10:10-11# This illustrates what the people will accept as their shepherd.

John 10:10# Evidently the nation of Israel has had a time of peace since it refers to them as fat. Antichrist comes into power and signs a peace treaty. Israel experiences a time of peace it seems before Antichrist breaks the treaty after 42 months.# Tearing off the hoofs of the sheep probably represents the shepherd as extremely greedy, searching for the last edible morsel that he can extract from his charges whom he has consumed.28# Zechariah 11:17a \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! Woe, take pity, because God will destroy this false shepherd. John 10:12# Zechariah 11:17b A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo; The arm represents power, the eye intelligence. These will be destroyed. God will remove his power and his intelligence. Revelation 13:3# his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye utterly darkened. - JNDarby translation# A sword will hurt the Good Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7# Summary of Antichrist# He will be a man from Israel, not interested in women given great satanic authority to reign as king.# It seems at one point he receives a fatal blow and is miraculously restored to life.

The nations won\u0026rsquo;t be able to control themselves. They will gravitate to jerusalem. The center of the tesnion will be Jerusalem.# Jerusalem will become an absession to the nations. It will make them stumble around like drunken people.# This may be fulfilled when the peace treaty is signed.# Zechariah 12:2b and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. The central focus of the nations appears to be Jerusalem which is at the center of Judah, therefore it will also be attacked.# Zechariah 12:3a \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples;# In that day\u0026hellip;this is when the nations of the world come up against Jerusalem, Jerusalem will become a heavy stone# all who lift it will be severely injured.

ALso of man\u0026rsquo;s spirit within him. Is God limited to moving someone\u0026rsquo;s spirit in one direction or another? God says if you try to move or affect Jerusalem in any way, I will do it to you! This is true throughout hsitory not just during this time. To all the peoples of all time.# This refers to the whole period of the Tribulation.# Those who try to mess with the apple of God\u0026rsquo;s eye will have to deal with God.# Zechariah 12:3b And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. Not some, but all. Zechariah 14:2,# This is the insanity of the nations against Israel.\nThis hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet but Zechariah says, it will happen one day. When? We can\u0026rsquo;t be dogmatic but there are certain clues in Scripture.# Possible scenario:# Israel is regathered in the land. Ezekiel 37:12, Isaiah 11:11-42# Ancient cities rebuild and inhabited. Ezekiel 36:1-5, 8-10# Muslim Arab resistance - Jeremiah 49# Isaiah 17, Zephaniah 4:2, Jeremiah 49# Has to be a level of security and prosperity. Ezekiel 38:10-12,# Once they are then Gog and Magog - perhaps this will be the catalyst to sign the peace treaty. Daniel 9# Midpoint of tribulation.

But I will watch over the house of Judah,# Zechariah 12:4c while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. The nations come against Israel on horses. Ezekiel 38-39,# blindness - removed from jewish people, Zechariah 12:10# madness, blindness and bewilderment is an interesting combo. Deuteronomy 28:28,# It is a dangerous thing to go against Israel. Israel\u0026rsquo;s true iron dome is God. Psalm 21:4# Zechariah 12:5a \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, In order for Judah to recognize their help comes from the Lord, they have to have their blindness removed. Judah recognizes in their hearts that their defender, the one who fights for them is the Lord of Hosts. Proverbs 4:23, Nehemiah 4:20# The pride of Israel has to be broken and depend on God. Daniel 12:7# Zechariah 12:5b \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo;# Just like Israel, we too have blindness that needs to be removed. We too have things that we regard as strengths and one by one God has to show us that those are hinderances rather than strengths.# One of Israel\u0026rsquo;s problem is their success.

He is wanting to show us our only strength is when He is our strength. This is a lesson that cannot be learned unless you go through it.# Zechariah 12:6a \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, Once God is on their side (they trust God) they will be mighty and untouchable.# Zechariah 12:6b so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples,# Zechariah 12:6c while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem will be back in her place. The land is theirs by right. The creator of the earth has deeded them the land.# They are dwelling on their own sites.

Hebrews 11:7, Phillipians 1:13# tents - defenseless people.# Zechariah 12:7b so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. people living in the city have fortification (gated community). Both those in the tents (homeless) and those in the city will be saved in the exact same way.# Success will not be attributed to human ability.# The Lord will defend the tents before the protected capital so that both recognize it is the Lord. Both will realize the victory is of the Lord.# In order for the instrument not to take credit from God, he often chooses the least qualified people to use.# Gideon - least of his clan# Moses - isn\u0026rsquo;t qualified. Not a speaker.# Jeremiah - Who am I? I am but a youth# If God can work through a flawed instrument, people won\u0026rsquo;t say it was them, people are obligated to say God did it. if we believe that we are inadequate for God, take heart, we are precisely the kind of person God has used throughout history! 1 Corinthians 1:26-31, 2 Corinthians 10:17# God will work so that human pride will not be indulged. 5# Zechariah 12:8 \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem,# Zechariah 12:8 and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, God is their strength. They are supernaturally powerful. The most feeble will be like David! 1 Samuel 18:7# Zechariah 12:9a and the house of David will be like God,# man thinking he can become a God started in the very beginning. This is not saying it is like Genesis 3:5, Isaiah 14:14# This should be understood as they will seem like God in the eyes of their enemies. Exodus 7:1# Zechariah 12:9b like the angel of the LORD before them.# The Angel of the Lord is limitless in His power. Isaiah 37:6# The reason they will look like the Angel of the Lord before them, is becuase it really is the Angel of the Lord fighting for them.# Zechariah 12:9c \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:10 - A Day of Mourning\nZechariah 12:10a \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, Only when Israel comes back will God pour out His Spirit. Ezekiel 36:24-25, Joel 2:28# God is regathering Israel, even today, bringing them back to the land. Ezekiel 36:24# Spirit is RUAH. God is pouring out grace in verse 10 and removing the spirit (RUAH) of impurity in verse 12. The land is mourning in verse 10 but is cleansed in verse 12.# The prophets spoke of the Day when God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit would be poured out. It would be the dawning of a new age when all the promises made would be fulfilled. Isaiah 32:15, Joel 2:28-32, Ezekiel 39:29# Zechariah 12:10b so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; Psalm 22:16-17, Zechariah 2:11# John confirms the fulfillment of this prophecy as he stood from afar and watched Jesus being crucified and pierced through with a spear. John 19:34-37# When the Jews killed people they were stoned. John 8:58-59# When the Messiah was to come the Jews pierced Him.# Psalm 22 predicts the crucifixion 1000 years in advance.# Isaih 53:5 is a prophecy 700 years in advance of the cross.# This is 500 years before this method of capital punishment. If a man would have written Zechariah they would have said the man they had stoned\u0026hellip;Acts 2:23# Yet the fulfillment of this verse is not when they pierced Jesus Christ but during the Tribulation period when the nation of Israel repents. They will change their minds regarding Jesus. This is at least 2500 years in advance.# Zechariah 12:10c and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, The loss of a son, an only son is among the greatest sorrows known to man.# When Israel comes to life, they will begin to sob with great sadness.# Some say that in order to be saved one must exert emotion, particularly sadness. If this is true, then Judas was saved. Hell will be filled with people who exerted deep sadness but never repented.# The nation here is exerting sadness because they are saved.# The only requirement to receive the free gift of salvation is faith. John 3:16, Acts 16:30-31, Ephesians 2:8-9# We are justified freely by his grace. Romans 5:1# Upwards of 150 passages in the Bible condition receiving salvation to believing only. 29# It is grace that teaches us the deep appreciations of the Person of Christ and His work. Titus 2:11-13# They will see Jesus of Nazareth in a new way! Upon realizing who He is and what He did they will be impacted by their response of rejection. Their self-righteousness had taken them to crucify God\u0026rsquo;s Shepherd who in turn gave His life for the sheep.# The Holy Spirit includes several instances in Scripture of grieving parents over their only son.# Exodus# Luke 7:12-15 Widow from Nain# Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10# Joseph story: brothers betrayed him, then his brothers reunited. They rejected him then received him. Gen 50:20, Gen 45:14, The brothers are a type of Israel\u0026rsquo;s story when they are reunited with their Messiah.\nZechariah 12:10-13:1 The Deliverance of Judah\nZechariah 12:10 and they will weep bitterly over Him# Matthew 5:4 \u0026ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.# Zechariah 12:10 like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.# This is\nZechariah 12:11a \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem,# Zechariah 12:11b *like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.*2 Chronicles 35:25-27# Josiah, one of the last godly kings, when he died there was great weeping.\nIn Josiah\u0026rsquo;s death, the last hope for Judah faded and the people wept uncontrollably.\nThis is the valley of Armageddon.

The flying Scroll of vision 6.# There will be an interval period of 75 days. Daniel 12:11 1290 - Midpoint to end of tribulation is 1260 but 1335 (+45)# 12 and 13 are so close, a chapter division was uncalled for. Same place, people and theme are the same in Chapter thirteen.# Israel converts in chapter 12 but cleansed in chapter 13.# Ezekiel 47 - fountain flows into Dead Sea. Dead sea comes back to life. This may be a prophecy like that.# Zechariah 13:1 for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. this fountain pictures the cleansing that takes place in Israel. Ezekiel 36:24-28, John 3:3, 5# Zechariah 13:2a \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, Idolatry will be removed from the land.# Commandments #1 and #2 deal with idolatry. Ignoring these first two commandments is what got Israel sent into captivity.# Zechariah 13:2b and they will no longer be remembered;# Zechariah 13:2c-5 False Prophets removed\nZechariah 13:2c and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.# the unclean spirit is what Satan uses to blind people and believe the deception of the false prophets.# False prophets can do miracles.\nSay, Let\u0026rsquo;s follow other gods. Contradict what God has said. Prediction is inaccurate. Deuteronomy 18:20-22 Revealtion 20:1 - Satan bound for 1000 years. So we would not deceive nations. Idolatry will not be started again because they will be bound up.\nDemonic influence is removed\u0026hellip;no temptation to idolatry. Those born in Millenium will have freedom to choose for or against God. None of Israel will reject God however. It will come from the nations.\nZechariah 13:3 \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; This is a return to the law. Deuteronomy 13:1-5# Parents who have children who have false prophets will execute them.\nZechariah 13:3 and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. Deuteronomy 13:6-10# Zechariah 13:4 \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, Jeremiah 23, Ezekiel 13# All teaching must be tested. How do we test it? By placing it in light of Scripture. 1 John 4:1# Zechariah 13:4-5 and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; The dangerous situation for false prophets will cause them to go into hiding.# Elijah was a prophet who is known to have worn hairy robes. John the baptist also wore a heavy robe. 2 Kings 1:8, Matthew 3:4# Zechariah 13:5 but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; They will pretend they aren\u0026rsquo;t prophets at all. They will lie about their background.# Zechariah 13:6a \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Him in the context is a false prophet trying to avoid being caught.# Traditionally this verse has been interpreted to say that this is talking about Jesus. To see Jesus in this passage is simply a poor hermeneutic as the context will not allow it.# False prophets and would cut themselves to enhance their ecstasy, to increase ritual potency, or to identify themselves with a particular god. 1 Kings 18:28; Jeremiah 41:5; 48:37# If someone saw such wounds on a false prophet\u0026rsquo;s body in that future day, the false prophet might claim that he had received his injuries by accident in a friend\u0026rsquo;s house. The modern practice of claiming, \u0026ldquo;I walked into a door,\u0026rdquo; to avoid telling the real reason for an injury, is similar. Wounds \u0026ldquo;between the arms\u0026rdquo; (lit. hands) 1# Zechariah 13:6b Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; False prophets, in order not to get caught, will say it was an accident to avoid further questioning.# Zechariah 13:7-9 - Israel Struck their own Shepherd\nZechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, God commands the death penalty upon Messiah. Isaiah 53:10# Contrary to popular opinion, when God gave His son, Messiah, it was to be the sin bearer for all of humanity. Isaiah 53:12, John 3:16, Romans 5:8# God allowed the Jews to have their way and to convince Rome to hold a public crucifixion of an innocent man, the lamb of God.# *And against the man, My Associate,\u0026quot;*literally, “the man of my union.” The Hebrew for “man” is “a mighty man,” one peculiarly man in his noblest ideal. “My fellow,” that is, “my associate.” “My equal” ([De Wette]; a remarkable admission from a Rationalist). “My nearest kinsman” [Hengstenberg],# Declares the LORD of hosts. The identity of the Messiah, He will man and divine# My Associate - the son\nThe Shepherd that was struck with the Sword - Matthew 26:30\nJesus to Disciples - Jesus quotes this verse.\nGod here associates himself with the Shepherd that was struck. When Israel rejected the Son they rejected the Father.\nMatthew 26:31 - Jesus quoted this verse.\nZechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep.# The little ones - the disciples were scattered, Israel was scattered. Deut 4:27# Mark 14:27-28 And Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;You will all fall away, because it is written, \u0026lsquo;I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.\u0026rdquo;# Jesus quotes Zechariah then continues saying that He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah in with the Gospel accounts.# Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound. Notice how it is God who plays the leading role in Messiah\u0026rsquo;s work. He causes him to be stricken. God raises Messiah back up.# Isaiah 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.# Jesus was smitten of God. The next verse goes on to explain why\u0026hellip;# Isaiah 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.# The word scourging (CHABBURAH singular) here is another word for blow or wound. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins.# Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do this 500 years in advance. He would strike down the Shepherd, turn His hand against the little ones and raise the Shepherd back up. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.# The Gospel was God\u0026rsquo;s eternal plan for the redemption of man.# Jesus\u0026rsquo; death on the cross is the maximim expression of love and justice merging together at one place. The perfect justice requiring a perfect sacrifice was realized when God\u0026rsquo;s Son Himself paid with His life. At that same moment, God demonstrated His love for mankind. Romans 5:8# Zechariah 13:8-9 Israel is Fully Restored# Zechariah 13:8 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish;# Two thirds of Israel will die. Ezekiel 28:38# Hitler is known for having killed up to a third of Israel. What will happen at this time (in the Tribulation) in history has nothing camparable to it neither will there every be anything like it.# Matthew 24:15 - abomination of desolation. Let the reader understand - flee to the mountains.# Zechariah 13:8-9 But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, The immediate context refers to the land, two thirds of the people perishing and one third surviving, we can assume then the fire must also be literal.# The refiners fire is the way metals are purified. 1 Peter 1:6-7# This fire will serve God\u0026rsquo;s purposes to test the Jews and to look heavenward and call on the name of the Lord.# The remnant that survives would include the 144,000 sealed Jews mentioned in Revelation 7:1-8 and 14:1-5# God has to move heaven and earth to bring about Israel\u0026rsquo;s restoration.\nZechariah 13:9a Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested.# In the days of Zechariah, a refiner would take the raw gold or silver and place it in a ceramic container. Inside the container was the ore—not just the precious metal, but also impurities such as zinc, lead, and salt.30# The ceramic container was put into a fiery kiln for five days. During those five days, all of the impurities would separate to the outside edges of the container. Nothing would be left in the middle of the vessel but the pure silver or gold. 30# Zechariah 13:9b They will call on My name, They will call because they believe. Romans 10:9-10.# This verse has a chiastic structure using they, I, I, they.# When will the jewish nation call on the Lord? At the end of the Tribulation. Matthew 23:37-39, Psalm 118:26, Joel 2:32, Romans 10:13,# Zechariah 13:9c And I will answer them;# Romans 11:26 - the remaining 1/3 will be saved.# God will one day answer them because he is promising right here that this is what He will do.# Zechariah 13:9d I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; God has returned to them because they returned to Him in faith.# Zechariah 13:9e And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# Israel has returned. The Lord is her God.# Upon their successful response to the testing, once again Israel will be seen to be God\u0026rsquo;s people among the nations. God will bless them as His people.# Zechariah 14:1-3 The Kingdom\nZechariah 14:14:1-7 - Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s Deliverance\nIsrael is the naval of the earth . Ezekiel 5:5\nThe land of the Israel is in the center of the earth.\nThe naval is set in the center of the human body, so the land is the naval of the world, situated in the center of the world in Jerusalem. Jerusalem in the center of the land of Israel. And the sanctuary in the center of Jerusalem. The holy place in the center of the sanctuary, and the ark of the covenant in the center of the holy place, and the foundation stone before the holy place because from it the world was founded. 31\nA thirteenth-century crusader map places Jerusalem at the center of the earth\u0026hellip;[the map] depicts the earth as a three-leaf clover, each leaf being a continent: Europe, Asia, and Africa. The three are drawn together by a ring encircling a single city; that city is Jerusalem.15# Those who do not believe in the 1000 Millenial Reign of Christ say that Zechariah 14 is used far too heavily to defend it. We will seek to keep a sound hermeneutical approach in keeping with a consistently historical, grammatical view. When interpreting eschatology we must not change our method of Bible interpretation. Unlike Postmillenialist Milton Terry who wrote\u0026hellip;# \u0026ldquo;A thorough interpretation of the prophetic portions of the holy Scripture is largely dependent upon a mastery of the principles and laws of figurative language, and of types and symbols.\u0026rdquo;# The truth is, one must be use caution but to require \u0026ldquo;mastery\u0026hellip; of the types and symbols\u0026rdquo; is to require only the best can interpret the text, implying really a private interpretation. We will try to allow the Scriptures to explain to us the intended meaning of the Text.# How would one determine that this prophecy has to do with a “millennial reign” of Christ upon the earth?# Did Jesus, during his earthly ministry, so interpret it?# Did any inspired New Testament writer quote from Zechariah 14, giving it a “dispensational” interpretation?# exactly who is it that will make that escape flight to the east when the mountain is cleft? Moreover, it cannot be the righteous, for they will be “caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thes. 4:17). Who else, pray tell, is left?# Since summer and winter will occur only as long as the earth remains (Gen. 8:22), and as the earth will not remain beyond the Coming of Christ (2 Pet. 3:4,10), it is obvious that the events of this verse cannot transpire after the literal return of Jesus - which supposedly is alluded to in verse 4# Verse 12 tells of Jehovah smiting his enemies and their “flesh” being consumed. Again, this cannot refer to a period after the literal return of Christ; the Coming of the Lord will signal “the end,” at which point the dead will be raised, and the living - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye - will be changed from flesh to a new, spiritual essence. We will pass from corruption to incorruption, from mortality to immortality (1 Cor. 15:23-24,51-53).# Three main views exist regarding the Millenium and the interpretation of Zechariah chapter 14.# Some hold it to be a symbolic prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, together with a spread of the gospel throughout the Christian age thereafter.32# Some say it is a depiction of the history of spiritual “Jerusalem” (the church), from the time of its commencement on the day of Pentecost throughout the Christian age.# Chapter 14 are Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy regarding a future fulfillment when Messiah returns to the earth to establish a literal earthly kingdom in Jerusalem.# Zechariah 14:1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. The nations will come to take wealth from Israel.# Then the Lord will return their spoil. Zechariah 14:14# Just like God took away, He now turns to bless them.# The interpretive key here is a day is coming. This clearly refers to the Day of the Lord which is a period of time.# They day of the Lord stands in contrast to man\u0026rsquo;s day. Currently man is having his day but a time will come when God will openly intervene with the affairs of man, first for judgment, then for blessing.# The day of the Lord in its broadest sense refers to the period of time beginnign with the rapture and continuing until the creation of the new heavens and new earth.# However the Day of the Lord does not always refer to the whole period of time. Context helps determine what portion of the day is being referred to. It could mean any one of the following:# The Tribulation period# The Second Coming# The Millenium# The entire period between the Rapture until the new heavens and the new earth.# There are different terms used to describe the nature of the Day of the Lord.# Wrath. Zephaniah 1:15, Zechariah 14:1-9# Judgment. Revelation 14:7# Indignation. Isaiah 26:20-21# Trial. Revelation 3:10# Trouble. Jeremiah 30:7# Destruction. Joel 1:15# Darkness. Amos 5:18# Desolation. Daniel 9:27# Overturning. Isaiah 24:1-4, 19-21# Punishment. Isaiah 24:20-21# Glory. Isaiah 11:10# Praise. Isaiah 12:1, 4# Salvation. Isaiah 25:9# Worship: Isaiah 27:13# Zechariah 14:2-3 The Great Tribulation# verses 2 and 3 cover most of the Great Tribulation period.# Zechariah 14:2a For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, The war of all world wars. Israel vs the nations of the earth.# God makes the nations join together against Israel. The is a world war against Israel. Ezekiel 38-39, Zechariah 12:3, Ezekiel 5:5, Ezekiel 38:12\nWorld War II and the enormous catastrophe it brought upon mankind occurred “probably mainly” because of anti-Semitism\u0026hellip;Indeed, Adolf Hitler launched the war to a large extent to prevent “world Jewry” from physically annihilating the German nation. 33\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a chunk of real estate the world community thinks peace will break out all over the Middle East. It\u0026rsquo;s a dispute of a territory that they call the West Bank . Why is it called the West Bank in the east? When you use the expression West Bank you\u0026rsquo;re using a Jordanian mindset. 34\nZechariah 14:2b the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, The people inside Jerusalem will take a beating.# 2/3 of the nation will be destroyed.\nZechariah 14:2c but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. The people outside of the city will not have access to help.# When the Romans came against Jerusalem in A.D. 70 they came with a multinational army and brought terrible destruction on the city and its people. Yet there was none of the deliverance that Zechariah will describe in the following verses, so it is difficult to say that this was fulfilled in the Roman attack upon Jerusalem in A.D. 70.35# The second coming\nZechariah 14:3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. Just about when things seem lost, when no one else will help Israel, the Lord will come and turn it all around. Psalm 121:4, Exodus 4:2,# Messiah will come and supernaturally overcome the nations going against Jerusalem. He no longer comes in reference to sin but as a conquering warrior. He returns as the Lion of Judah.# Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.# Revelation 19:12 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.# Revelation 19:13 He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.# Revelation 19:14 And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses. This is the Lord of Hosts coming.# Revelation 19:15 From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.# Revelation 19:16 And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, \u0026ldquo;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 14:4-9 7 Literal Events Foretold when Jesus Descends# 1. Zechariah 14:4a In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; 2 Samuel 15:30, Acts 1:9-12, Matthew 24:3,# the Mount of Olives rises to a height of 2,710 feet, making it higher than the Temple Mount.# The last time God descended on a mountain in this way was in the giving of the law. Exodus 19:18# Jerusalem, and to the east, the mount of olives are physical places. Jesus Christ is physically coming back to earth. Job 19:25# This is not the rapture of the Church. The rapture is not a return where we are caught up to meet the Lord in the air.# Jesus\u0026rsquo;s feet will first touch the earth where they left, ont he Mount of Olives. Just like Jesus left physically, he will return physically. Acts 1:9-11\n2. Zechariah 14:4c and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, The instant Jesus touches it, it will split the mountain.# An oil company doing seizmic studies fournd a major fault in this area going east to west precisely through the mount of Olivies. It is so severe that it could split at any time. It is waiting for the feet to land. Ezekiel 38:19# Experts say Israel lies on a major fault line which could split and cause the death of thousands. 36# Zechariah 14:4d so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.# 3. Zechariah 14:5a You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; The remnant will flee when this happens. Azel could be a village near Jerusalem.# Zechariah 14:5b yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Amos 1:1# Josephus mentions an earthquake in connection with Uzziahs sin (pride) as king decided to go into the temple to act as priest.# 4. Zechariah 14:5c Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! The holy ones is the church. Revelation 19:14, Revelation 1:6, 5:10# Angels will also be coming with Christ. Matthew 25:31, Jude 14,# God’s faithfulness and protective power during this gruesome attack on Jerusalem remind us that our safety does not depend on our distance from danger. Our safety is in God\u0026rsquo;s hands. He keeps us through the most dangerous times we will ever face.# 5. Zechariah 14:6 In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. Matthew 24:29, Revelation 16:10# Zechariah 14:6 For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD,# Zechariah 14:7 neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. At the point of evening, light comes.# When it is supposed to be the darkest, it becomes the lightest. Jesus is called the Morning star. 2 Peter 1:19, Revealtion 2:28, Revealtion 22:16# Zechariah 14:8-11 - The Kingdom Comes# 6. Zechariah 14:8a And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem,# In the day national Israel acknowledges Jesus\u0026hellip;these things will come about.\nThe whole kingdom program is riding on Israel\u0026rsquo;s response to their king. The whole earth could believe but if Israel does not, there will be no kingdom. However, though only Israel believe and no one else in the world believe, the kingdom will come.# The kingdom comes after Jesus returns in a literal, physical coming. This does not happen until Israel returns to the Lord.# Zechariah 14:8b half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea;# The Mediterranean sea is referred to as the western sea.

It is not west of Israel, it is west of Jordan. So from God\u0026rsquo;s perspective that land should be called the \u0026ldquo;East Bank\u0026rdquo;. Every time we use the term \u0026ldquo;West Bank\u0026rdquo; we are using an anti-Israel perspective.It\u0026rsquo;s better to use terms like Judea and Samaria.37# Zechariah 14:8c it will be in summer as well as in winter. that is, it will never dry up.

What an appropriate way to end the book!# The Nations Worship# Zechariah 14:16a Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem The nations that remain will be subject to the King of Kings who reigns from Jerusalem.

First Antichrist must be chained and thrown into the Abyss, then Messiah will take his rightful place and begin His ministry as King reigning from the city of Jerusalem.# That is why when Satan is released at the end of the Millenium, he goes straight to attack the Beloved City (Jerusalem) because he knows where the authority is. Revelation 20:7-9# Zechariah 14:16c The King who is the Lord of hosts\u0026hellip;There is no mistaking the identity of this King. He is the Lord of hosts.

That is, this human earthly regent is the universal sovereign. Revelation 19:16, Psalm 24:10 20# Zechariah 14:16b and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. The Feast of Booths of one of three of the most important feasts in the life of Israel. It was a time of grateful rejoicing. Leviticus 23:40, Deuteronomy 16:14-15, Nehemiah 8:17# Leviticus 23 gives the Jewish feasts. One of those is the Feast of Booths. It commemorates the provision of the Lord.# Celebrated The Feast of Booths does not imply that the Kingdom is once again under the law.# There are usually objections to taking the temple and sacrifices literally.# A return to the Mosaic Law which ended when Messiah died. While there are similarities in the sacrifices, they are different, just like Noah\u0026rsquo;s sacrifices were different from Moses\u0026rsquo; sacrifices.# The Noaic system and the Mosaic system had sacrifices yet they were not the same. They were both very different systems. Similarity is not equality.# All these differences show that this is not a return to the Law of Moses but is rather a Kingdom Law. How is it different?# Mosaic Law Kingdom Law No horses Horses Only Priest has access All have access Relates only to Israel Includes Israel, Church and the nations This is the only feast that Zechariah mentioned that is celebrated. However Zechariah 8:19 mentions turning mourning into feasts.# The Apostle Peter evidently concluded that the messianic kingdom had begun when he saw Jesus transfigured (Luke 9:33). He suggested that the disciples make three booths for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. This indicates that the Jews in Jesus\u0026rsquo; day associated the Feast of Booths with the beginning of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, which is the same connection that Zechariah made here. 1# Differences between Millenium and Eternal State\nMillenium Eternal State limited time (1000 years) never ending Rebellion at the end No evil Sin restrained Sin removed Curse restrained Curse Removed Still death No death Mortals and resurrected people Only Resurrected people Still preach gospel Destiny is sealed Renovation of earth New Creation Transitional Non-transitional (lasts forever) Luminaries (Sun moon and stars) No luminaries Satanic activity (at end) Satan is removed 4th Temple No Temple To the Nations - Blessings and Curses\nZechariah 14:17a And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem Clearly Jerusalem is a literal city. The families of the earth are the remaining people of the nations of the world.# Zechariah 14:17b to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. They will come to Jerusalem for the express purpose of worshipping the King. Matthew 2:6# First the eternal Angel of the Lord was seen to be a man. Then we see the man presented as a King. Now the King is presented as the Lord of Hosts and reigning in Jerusalem. Nations will come to him to worship. Matthew 2:2# Unlike any other king in the history of mankind, this king holds the world in His hands. He controls the wind and the rain. This will cause people to fear him as it did the disciples. Mark 4:39-41# The nations will need to walk by faith just like they have in any other age. They will need to trust in Messiah for salvation for what He did on calvary, They will need to walk by faith trusting in Messiah\u0026rsquo;s provision over the power of sin and also trust in Messiah to provide their material needs.# Failure to keep Kingdom law results in curses. Specifically in this case, they will get no rain.\nThe Millenial Kingdom - A Harmony of Worship in Three parts\nThis new Age brings God\u0026rsquo;s fulfilment of the New Covenant to Israel and Judah who will be united as one nation. Jeremiah 31:31# At the same time, in her glorified state, the ministry of New Covenant administration will be responsibility of the Church# Messiah deals with the nations in terms of blessings and curses depending on their relation to Him.# Zechariah 14:18a If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them;# Zechariah 14:18b it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. God has turned the tables. Egypt is now dependent on Israel\u0026rsquo;s God to survive. They must render homage every year to the Lord, otherwise they are not sent any rain.# Zechariah 14:19 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. Any nation who does not trust in the Lord to present themselves before the Lord on the Feast of Booths, will not receive any rain the following year.# Zechariah 14:20-21 The Holiness of The King will Prevail# Zechariah 14:20a In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; Due to the fact that Egypt has been given her rightful place in relation to Israel, we now see horses used in Israel. The horses are seen to contribute to the glorification of the LORD.# In the kingdom, Instead of using the horses to fight, they are used to ring bells that read \u0026ldquo;Holy to the Lord\u0026rdquo;.# This speaks of a new dispensation no longer under the law. Under the law, Israel was prohibited to own horses. If one point of the law must be changed, the whole law is affected. James 2:10# Therefore we conclude this must be a dispensation, the fulfillment of the New Covenant, not under the law but a multi-program administration under the Spirit of grace and supplication where priesthood and royalty are joined in one office characterized by a rule of peace and a rod of iron.# This is a new administration where God includes Christ as King of the nations, Israel as His dearest subjugates, Jerusalem as His capital city, Zion the mountain of his throne, the Church as His beautiful queen and the angels as his personal ministers.# During the age of Law, only the turban of the priest held an inscription, \u0026ldquo;holy to the Lord\u0026rdquo;. Exodus 28:36# During the 1000 years reign of Christ, even the minutest things like bells on horses will be considered set apart for the worship of the Lord.# The new means of walking will proceed from Zion in Jerusalem, not Sinai. Isaiah 2:1-4# The whole life will be pervaded by the holiness of the LORD. The people will then be the holy nation that God has always envisioned. Exodus 19:6 39# Zechariah 14:20b And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Here the cooking pots in the temple are likened to the 100 bowls in the temple. 2 Chronicles 4:8# Zechariah 14:21a Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; Every pot throughout the land will be usable. Not just those set apart for use in the temple.# Zechariah 14:21b and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. Every pot in the land will be usable for cooking the sacrifice. The implication is that all are sacrificing not just the priest as seen in Levitical law. Leviticus 6:24-28# Zechariah 14:21c And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day. Genesis 9:25-27, Isaiah 35:8; Ezekiel 43:7; 44:9; Revelation 21:27# The house of the Lord is referring to the 4th Temple of the Millenium. Canaanites will not be allowed into the temple.

The most basic reason for the Jewish denial of the messianic claims made on Jesus’ behalf is that he did not usher in world peace, as Isaiah had prophesied: “And nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore” (Isaiah 2:4 ). In addition, Jesus did not help bring about Jewish political sovereignty for the Jews or protection from their enemies.\nDr. Constable\u0026rsquo;s Notes on Zechariah 2022 Edition\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nHobert E.

Walvoord The predictions of Isaiah have to do with Babylon’s ultimate destruction in the Day of the Lord. The near and the far view are often mingled as in chapter 13. The destruction of Babylon is pictured in Isaiah 13:1-11 as part of God’s program to punish the entire world (cp. 13:11). The historic conquering of Babylon by the Medes and the Persians is mentioned specifically in Isaiah 13:17-19 The prophet seems to refer to the far view, that is, the destruction of Babylon in relation to the second coming of Christ. Isaiah 13:20-22.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nJohn F. Walvoord the prophecies of Jeremiah are notable because they were delivered at the peak of Babylon’s power when it seemed most unlikely that the great nation would fall. Babylon is pictured as being punished because of its cruel treatment of Israel (50:17, 18; 51:24, 49).Practically all of the predictions of Jeremiah seem to relate to the fall of Babylon by the attack of the Medes and the Persians. Only occasionally does there seem to be a reference to a future ultimate destruction as in Jeremiah 51:62-64.

      "content":"Zechariah Return to Me!\nA prodigal nation comes home\nYahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time\nNow if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be\u0026hellip;for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15\nWe know there are certain books in the Bible that are not as popular as others. Quite possibly however, the most underestimated of them all lies tucked away between the major prophets and the gospels. It lies quietly, just waiting to be explored.\nThat has been our experience as we have visited the book of Zechariah. We spent countless hours in the presence of Zechariah, allow him to speak for himself and allow the Holy Spirit’s teaching to grant us understanding into what the most Messianic, most apocalyptic and most eschatological book in the Old Testament may well be. As if that was not enough, the main thread joining the book is a true story of love, deep with affections that Yahweh Sabaoth has for a wayward people and how they respond to Hi\nThere is no telling what God might reveal to you about Himself and His affections towards you in this short book! May God use this study to grow you deeper in your understanding of the affections God has prepared for you. Our prayer is that you as you walk with Zechariah through this epic narrative, you’ll come to see Judah’s need for Him, God’s solution for them and the ultimate reunion of reunions when at last they return with all their heart to the Lord!\nThe illustrations Zechariah brings out in this book are enlightening and convicting! He has a list of appropriate examples from among the people to help show the reality of their spiritual condition. Returnees who never returned, people who mourned without knowing why, a high priest before God in filthy clothes, fleecing shepherd and blind sheep following a worthless shepherd, are only some of the illustrations contained in this little-known book.\nZechariah is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out and some of the details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.\nThe narrative of Zechariah shows how God tirelessly protects His nation form extinction while she (also tirelessly) commits spiritual adultery with the gods of the nations. God is greater than the greatest evil. His plans are from everlasting. He provisioned the means, by giving His own son, so that she can be redeemed and forgiven. However, when His Son came, she decided she did not like him and has Him crucified. Zechariah makes it clear, God’s offer still stands…return to me…I will return (come again) to you!\nYou are about to embark on the magnificent account of the ages of a prodigal nation who wanders endlessly and of a loving Father who waits tirelessly until his son, yes, his dear son, comes home at last. This book is bound to encourage you as it was intended for the generation of Zechariah, to a real, intimate fellowship with God.\nGod reveals His will, He calls people back to Himself and provides the way for their coming, and He promises that if they return to Him, He will return to them.\nTable of Contents\nThe Background of Zechariah. 4 Historical setting. 4 General Information. 6 The direct audience of Zechariah. 6 Writing style. 7 Why study the book of Zechariah?. 7 Why don’t more people study Zechariah?. 8 Before we continue….. 9 IZechariah 1:1-6 - The First Message – Theme of the book. 9 Zechariah 1:1-2 Setting and Author. 9 Zechariah 1:2-3 The great appeal, \u0026ldquo;return to Me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo;. 12 Zechariah 1:4-6 Their fathers returned but never returned to the Lord. 16 Zechariah 1:7-6:8 - The Second Message: Eight Visions. 22 Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the horseman. 23 Zechariah 1:18-21 A Vision of four horns \u0026amp; four craftsmen. 32 Zechariah 2:1-13 A vision of measuring Jerusalem.. 33 Zechariah 2:6-13 Poem of God’s wrath upon the nations. 35 Zechariah 3:1-10 A vision of Joshua the high priest. 40 Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold. 45 Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll. 49 Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket. 51 Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots 54 Zechariah 6:9-15 A crown fit for The King. 58 IV.

Doctrines in Zechariah.. 138 The Background of Zechariah# Historical setting# Along with Haggai and Malachi, Zechariah is a post-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C.# After being exiled for 70 years, Jews began returned to the land in 538b.C. Psalm 126:1‑6# Why were they exiled for a period of 70 years?# God commanded Israel to rest the land. Every seven years the people were to trust God to provide while they rested the land. Since they did not trust the Lord, they kept farming the land even on the seventh year\u0026hellip;they did not rest every seventh year for 70 years. Leviticus 26:34-35, 2 Chronicles 36:21# They had been in the Promised Land for roughly 800 years, but for 490 years, they disobeyed his Sabbath rest.# There will three returns to the land.# 538 b.C. – Lead by Zerubbabel (Zechariah’s group)# 530 b.C. - Lead by Ezra# 445 b.C. – Lead by Nehemiah -# In 539 b.C. Cyrus the Persian conquered the Babylonians and in 538b.C. issued a decree for the Jews to be allowed to go back to Judah and gave order to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. 2 Chronicles 36:22-23, Ezra 5:13, 6:3# The prophet Isaiah had said 150 years before…It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot; Isaiah 44:28, Ezra 1:1-2, 7-8, 3:7, 5:13-17, 6:14, Isaiah 45:1# Zerubbabel was placed in charge as governor and was given finances for the rebuilding of the temple. Ezra 3:7-8# Upon first arriving, people seeing the site of the first temple, gave offerings for it to be rebuilt. Ezra 2, 2:68-69# The Jews first went to their own cities. Ezra 2:70# On the first day of the seventh month, the priests and their brothers along with Zerubbabel and his brothers came together with all the people in Jerusalem and repaired the altar on its foundation and renewed the daily sacrifices. Ezra 3:1-7# Upon the second year of their return, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple and when it was completed, a great inaugural service was held praising God for his lovingkindness. Ezra 3:8-11# This caused a lot of interest in the Samaritans to the north of Judah (the people beyond the river). They wanted to help rebuild the temple. Ezra 4:1-2# However, their help was refused because they had syncretized their fear of God with pagan religions. Ezra 4:3, 2 Kings 17:33, 41# When the builders refused their help, they proceeded to make all sorts of trouble. They discouraged and frightened the people of Judah from continuing to build. Ezra 4:4# The Samaritans (the people of the land) hired advisors to frustrate their efforts during the days of Cyrus, all the way into the reign of Darius. Ezra 4:5# The leaders of the land and the rest of the nations that lived in Samaria and the neighbourinig area got behind these efforts, and together they issued a letter to king Artaxerxes. Ezra 4:7# The king responded their letter commanding the leaders issue a decree prohibiting the rebuilding of the city. They set up armed guards to stop any buidling activity. Ezra 4:23-24# After about 16 years of their arrival, Haggai and Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophetic ministries began. By faith, in accordance with God’s command, Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest, along with the prophets, began to build the temple. Ezra 5:1-2# Once again, the leaders of the land tried to oppose them. However, God allowed the people to continue until communication was made with king Darius. Ezra 5:3-17# Cyrus’ decree to go back and rebuild was lost and the current king, Darius I, had to search through years of records to verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12# When king Darius I found Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s original decree, he immediately ordered to allow the rebuilding to continue. Ezra 6:1-5# Darius commanded the governor of Samaria to not only leave the rebuilding of the temple, but for the full cost of the temple to be paid out of the treasury of the taxes of Samaria without delay. Ezra 6:8-12# It would be four years before the Jews would successfully finish the building. Ezra 6:14-22# General Information# Division of the book of Zechariah Zechariah 1:1-6 The first message: Theme of the book Zechariah 1:7-6 The second message: eight night visions 1.

He is rejected 2. The people return to God, He returns to them Key Term: Return The direct audience of Zechariah# The book of Zechariah was written to Jews who came to the land after having left it completely desolate for 70 years.# While some of the older generation did survive the 70 years, most of the people were born in Babylon and had never seen Judah, Jerusalem or the temple before.# 42,360 people returned to Judah on this first wave, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers. Included in this group were members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2, Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70# Zechariah has a secondary audience among the Jews who would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He chose to make unconditional promises to Abraham. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally to the people who turn to Him by faith. Genesis 12:1-3# Therefore, the contents of the book of Zechariah are still playing out today and will serve as a strong witness during the days of the Tribulation when God once again begins working his program with Israel. Zechariah 12-14, 12:10# Writing style# 2 major divisions# Chapters 1-8 are dated specifically, and author is stated (quoted mostly in Revelation)# Chapters 9-14 are undated, and no author stated (quoted mostly in the Gospels)# Other prophets had the same style of division in half# Isaiah 1-39 and 40-66,# Ezekiel 1-39 and 40-48# Daniel 1-6 and 7-12# Genre# Zechariah is an example of apocalyptic literature. It contains mostly prose, and poetry# Zechariah 1-8 are prose except for Zechariah 2:6-13.# Zechariah 9-14 are poetry (Zechariah 9:2-11:14, 17, 13:7-9)# According to some ancient manuscripts, Zechariah was also a poet. His name is in the titles of: Psalm 137, 145— 50 in the LXX [Septuagint], Psalm 111, 145 in the Vulgate; Psalm 125, 145—48 in the Syriac.\u0026quot; [1] # 515b.C. Note: This Psalm [145 in LXX], and the four following, which end the book, are supposed to have been sung at the dedication of the second temple\u0026hellip; [2] # The variety of Scriptural genres and structures implies a creative element on the part of the human author. [3] # Why study the book of Zechariah?# Jerome calls Zechariah the most obscure book in the OT. Yet, it is alluded to extensively in the New Testament. We should understand why authors like the Gospel writers, Peter and others quoted it.# Though Israel is never merged or likened with the Church and the Church has never replaced Israel, Zechariah teaches the faithfulness of God as He is bound to His word to keep it.# It is a message filled with admonishment, encouragement, exhortation, hope and restoration.# It was because of the prophecies of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the temple restarted and completed four years later. Ezra 6:14# Zechariah contains a forward pointing view of the Gospel that can easily be understood from our point in time, giving the book a highly Evangelistic message for Gentiles as well as to those with a Jewish mindset.# The New Testament quotes or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.# Not only does it unfold prophetic details, but it also allows us insight into behind-the-scenes spiritual warfar# It shows how God is in control and never forgets his promises.# Most importantly, it reveals to us the person of Messiah. Zechariah dwells on the Person and the work of Christ more fully than all the minor prophets put together. Revelation 19:10# It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father prior to his first coming.# It shows us His nature during his first coming and finally his galant entry and conquest on his second return as conquering king.# Why don’t more people study Zechariah?# Because it’s seldom taught as it presents the interpreter with difficulties. Since teachers don’t teach it, people aren’t interested to want to study it.# People who have read through Zechariah will say it is cryptic, confusing and difficult to understand.# The visions are full of symbolism# There doesn’t seem to be any set theme that flows throughout.# Chapters 1-8 seem disconnected from chapters 9-14# While there are difficulties in studying the book of Zechariah, the message that can be clearly understood far outweighs any difficulties.# One thing that will aid our understanding is knowing the promises of the future have nothing to do with returning from Babylon, since that had already occurred about 14 years prior.# It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological map of the future but rather to present to us the grand scheme of Israel’s future as fulfilled in Messiah-the very purpose of prophecy. Zechariah contains the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God\u0026rsquo;s plan of restoration.# “The prophecy of Zechariah is to the Old Testament what the book of Revelation is to the New. It is the apocalypse of the Old Testament which portrays God’s future dealings with His chosen people Israel . . . The book of Zechariah, especially chapter 14, stands as a continual corrective to all those theories which deny the literal, future restoration of Israel, after a period of chastening, in her own land, over whom the Messiah will reign in Zion”. [4] # The book of Zechariah shows how God works when His people stray, always calling them back to Himself.# Zechariah contains teaching that reveals a wayward heart and how to return to God.# All the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah, Christ the Lord and how it is that the people need to return to Him.# Before we continue…# We would encourage you to take a minute before going on to ask God to unveil the contents of this book. Allow yourself to be teachable, the Holy Spirit Himself is the author behind Zechariah and He will guide you in all truth.# The divisions of the book are often presented as 8-4-2. That is, 8 visions, 4 messages and 2 burdens. Though that is true, the main thrust of the book is contained in 1 message, “return to me” which is presented as an introductory message and often ignored. Therefore we suggest that the divisions be understood as 1-8-4-2 with the first being the principal guide and theme for unlocking the book.# Zechariah 1:1-6 - The First Message – Theme of the book# Zechariah 1:1-2 Setting and Author# Zechariah 1:1a In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,… This is Darius I (Darius the Great) son of Darius Hystaspes who reigned from 29th of September 522 b.C. to October 486 b.C..# The dating given is according to a Gentile king. This is because no Jewish king was reigning, and the \u0026ldquo;Times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo; is underway. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24, Mark 13:14# Zerubbabel is the governor of Judah under the Medo-Persian empire.# Judah was overthrown by Babylon and taken into captivity. When they returned, they were subject to the whims of the Medo-Persians. Even though Zerubbabel was in the direct line of David, he was not king. This confirms Coniah\u0026rsquo;s curse. Luke 3:27, Matthew 1:12, Jeremiah 22:30# Zechariah was written as four messages.# The first message of the book was written in the eighth month of 520 b.C., Zechariah 1:1# The second message was written three months later. Zechariah 1:7# The third message was written in 518 b.C. Zechariah 7:1# No dating is given for the fourth message found in chapters 9 through 14 but it appears to have been written at a later date and under different circumstances.# The whole book is written from and is regarding the city of Jerusalem. What changes is the time. Some have suggested the following timeframe.# Chapters 1-8 Jerusalem under Medo-Persian rule (586-332 b.C.)# Chapters 9-10 Jerusalem governed by Greece (332-63 b.C.)# Chapter 11 Jerusalem under Roman domination (63 b.C.-70 A.D.f)# Chapters 12 to 14 Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s last days of national history# The future promises for Israel contained in this short book serve to provide a record throughout the ages as encouragement to Israel to return to Yahweh Shabaot. Every generation of Jew for over 2500 years has had, in the record of Zechariah, a faithful testimony of Yahweh interacting with her throughout the ages to bring about her yet future return.# One day, in the not-so-distant future, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s book will find it\u0026rsquo;s total fulfillment in a literal way and \u0026ldquo;all will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo;.# Zechariah 1:1b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,… It was the word of the Lord, not Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s imagined word. This was the word of the Lord the moment it was receive# Zechariah did not become the word of the Lord when it was included in the canon of Scripture.# It was, is and will continue to be God’s word.# Zechariah was a prophet. This was his role. He received messages from the Lord and relayed them to the people.# Zechariah was of the tribe of Levi. His name means \u0026ldquo;Yahweh remembers\u0026rdquo;. Nehemiah 12:1, 16# Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah was both prophet and priest.# Zechariah became a head of his own division of priests during the time of Joiakim, the son of Joshua. Nehemiah 12:12, 16# In the beginning of his ministry, Zechariah was probably a young man and was born in Babylon. Zechariah 2:4# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s contemporary, Haggai, began his ministry in September of 520 b.C. as well. While Haggai\u0026rsquo;s focus was to rebuild the temple, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy complemented his ministry focusing on a spiritual return to the Lord.# While Haggai\u0026rsquo;s focus is more on things past and present, the message given to Zechariah will reach far into the future, relating to the returning generation of a wonderfully restored Jewish nation back in fellowship with Almighty God.# Zechariah 1:1c *the son of Berechiah,…*Berechiah was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s father. Not much is known about Berechiah except that his name means \u0026ldquo;Yahweh blesses\u0026rdquo;. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra among the returnees.# Jesus makes a statement about Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s son, Zechariah being martyred. Matthew 23:35# There are differing opinions regarding Jesus mentioning Berechiah.# Option 1: Jehoiada means the same as Berechiah. There was another prophet Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was martyred. Since both father\u0026rsquo;s names essentially mean the same thing, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus. 2 Chronicles 24:20-22# Option 2: A copyist error. Some suggest it could be a copyists\u0026rsquo;s error in the transcription of the Greek text.# Option 3: Though this tragedy was done in secret, Jesus confesses having witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder, just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s, which was also done in secret. This seems the most plausible option of the three.# If this is true, and we believe it is, it is not recorded anywhere in Scripture. That, however, does not make it false.# Matthew seemed familiar with the book of Zechariah – he quotes it at least three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus mention this event, so he brings this detail out where the other Gospel writers do not.# In the context of Matthew, Jesus seems to be alluding to the first and last of the righteous prophets of the Old Testament. To say that Zechariah son of Jehoiada was the last would exclude many prophets (including Zechariah) as righteous.# God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He sees all that is done in public as well as in secret. Ultimately, he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20# Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also says that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. These rabbis would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus.# Zechariah 1:1d the son of Iddo… Iddo is Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. His name means \u0026ldquo;appointed time\u0026rdquo;.# Iddo was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 12:4, 12:16# Zechariah is also referred to as the son of Iddo. This was common and similar calling him forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14# Ezra speaks of prophet Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. Perhaps the Zechariah’s role of priest became prominent and is what Ezra brings out.# Together, the names Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say, \u0026ldquo;Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time\u0026rdquo;. The harmonizes wonderfully with the message of the book. When the appointed time comes, God will fulfill all His promises and they will be carried out with overflowing blessing.# Zechariah 1:2-3 The great appeal, \u0026ldquo;return to Me and I will return to you\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 1:2a \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers… the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36# The pre-exilic fathers are used as an example of what not to do. It was their refusal to listen that sent the nation into exile for 70 years.# Zechariah 1:2b \u0026hellip;Very angry literally says angry with anger.# Zechariah 1:3b \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them Thus says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s primary audience are the people who have returned from exile in Babylon. Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo; word to the people.# This included the few older generation, the ones born in Babylon and specifically mentioned are Zerubbabel and Joshua.# What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God\u0026rsquo;s word. Zechariah 1:7, 1:7, 4:6, 4:8, 6:9, 7:1, 7:4, 7:8, 8:1, 8:18, 9:1, 11:11, 12:1# God spoke through the prophets. Hebrews 1:1,# God’s word is inspired (carried) by the Holy Spirit. 2 Timothy 3:16-17# When God speaks something, He is tied to His word to fulfill it. Ezra 1:1, Proverbs 30:5, Hebrews 6:17-18,# *The Lord of Hosts…*who is the Lord of Hosts?# In Hebrew it is Yahweh Sabaoth sometimes translated Almighty of armies. It appears 235 times in the Bible# The first time this name of God appears in the Bible is in 1 Samuel when the people of Israel were concerned about armies, particularly the Philistine armies.# The name appears often in prophetical books.# The Lord of Hosts is mentioned no less than 53 times in Zechariah. Therefore, in order to better understand it, we should get better acquainted with this name for God. Luke 2:13, Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psalm 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53# The Lord of Hosts is the Commander of Armies# Isaiah 13:4 \u0026hellip;is mustering the army for battle. Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3, 1 Kings 22:19# Isaiah 19:16 \u0026hellip;Awake to punish all the nations\u0026hellip; Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7# Nahum 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am against you,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.\u0026rdquo; Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3; Psalm 103:20-21; Matthew 13:41, 24:30-31; Revelation 19:11-20# David was familiar with the meaning of the Lord of hosts. He invoked the Lord of Hosts when going to battle with Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10# Though David took off Saul\u0026rsquo;s armor, he put on the Lord of Hosts. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27# The Lord of Hosts is the King:# Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19, 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14# Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# When Christ is seated on His throne, He will be called the Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16-17# The Lord of Hosts is the Redeemer:# Isaiah 47:4 Our Redeemer*, the LORD of HOSTS\u0026hellip;*# Isaiah 44:6 \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5# The Lord of Hosts is Holy:# Isaiah 6:3 \u0026ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16# The Lord of Hosts is Almighty:# Daniel 4:35 \u0026ldquo;All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN \u0026amp; among the inhabitants of earth \u0026amp; no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, \u0026lsquo;What have You done?\u0026rdquo;# The Lord of Hosts and the Davidic Covenant\u0026hellip;# 2 Samuel 7:27 \u0026ldquo;For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to Your servant, saying, \u0026lsquo;I will build you a house\u0026rsquo;;\u0026hellip;# It is the Lord of Hosts who will ultimately will avenge the injustice done to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8# As the prophets used this title, they stressed Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty in action, not just in its abstract meaning. That is, they saw Yahweh Sabaoth as leading all armies—armies of stars, angels, and people.# Zechariah lived when Israel had lost its army, had no military power, had little political organization, and no political power. Thus, by referring to Yahweh as \u0026ldquo;the LORD of armies,\u0026rdquo; Zechariah was reminding his hearers of their God\u0026rsquo;s abiding and active sovereignty.[5] # God is the Lord of the stars, the powers of heaven, and all the forces of the universe - a most inclusive and comprehensive name for God. [6] # The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in the aspect of God that God stressed in revealing Himself to His people through its writer. Zechariah used the name Yahweh Sabaoth more than any other book of the Bible.# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message comes directly from the Lord of hosts himself\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;thus says the Lord of hosts\u0026rdquo; Psalm 84:1-12# Zechariah 1:3c \u0026ldquo;Thus says the Lord of hosts\u0026hellip;Return to Me,\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The Lord Almighty, Lord of the armies, says this\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;come back to Me\u0026rdquo;.# While Haggai is more focused on the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message is to encourage the people to return into right relationship with God.# They had come back from exile, but they needed to turn fully and trustingly to the Lord.# Some are offended at the idea that God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty would be affected if man had any say in the matter. Yet clearly in this circumstance we have the Lord of Hosts Himself inviting His nation to willingly \u0026ldquo;return to Me\u0026rdquo;. It would be hypocritical of God to call to a return and force them to do so.# God sovereignly chooses to limit Himself sovereignly allows man to respond to His invitation at will. God is looking for free responses, not forced gestures. Zechariah proves this.# God makes the invitation and leaves it up to man to respond. He makes it a point to draw all of mankind to Himself. John 12:32, 48# Zechariah tells us is that God is faithful to His word. He will patiently hold back the wonderful promises made to Israel until she returns in belief. Romans 11:23, Zechariah 12:10# All of God\u0026rsquo;s promises to withhold blessings will be kept. Zechariah shows this.# All of God\u0026rsquo;s promises to return to them when they return to Him will also be kept. Zechariah describes this.# In the meantime, God protects Israel from annihilation (you can\u0026rsquo;t keep a promise to a nation that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist), keeping the gentile nations at bay until that wondrous day when she returns to Him with all her heart.# Romans 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!# The returning Jews needed to understand that merely returning to the land, reinhabiting Jerusalem, rebuilding the temple is not synonymous with placing their confidence in the Lord of Hosts. 1 John 3:3# Zephaniah 3:1 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!# Zephaniah 3:2 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.# The opposite of returning is to forsake. When they didn\u0026rsquo;t trust the Lord, they were completely forsaking the Lord of hosts. They kept the law in part and placed their trust in idolatry, wealth and even their religious form. Not trusting the Lord and serving other gods is called \u0026ldquo;doing evil\u0026rdquo;. Deuteronomy 4:25, 17:2-5# Zechariah 1:3d declares the LORD of hosts,… This is a declaration from the Lord. It is probable Zechariah preached this message to all the people.# One might think this exhortation is really uncalled for at a time like this. The people had just gone through a time of discipline where God took them away from the land into a strange land to live among a strange, pagan people who did not have the same practices and customs as they did.# Surely they didn\u0026rsquo;t need exhorting to return to the Lord? The Lord seemed to think they did. That was enough for Zechariah and it should be enough for us when we are exhorted by the Lord.# A new generation was now coming back to the land, They had left their exilic homes, and reistablished the daily sacrifices. The foundation for the temple was even laid. Things were seemingly going well, Did the prophet not understand how much they had already sacrificed? Wasn\u0026rsquo;t God pleased with them?# God is more interested for their hearts to be tuned to Him, instead of all their hard efforts for Him. The Jews needed first of all to return to Him spiritually. This vital aspect of their return was totally overlooked and taken for granted due to the circumstances.# When the trials of the building project come their way, they were quickly discouraged and frustrated. They had not been trusting the Lord of hosts for His daily spiritual provision in their lives, how could they trust God for the rebuilding of the temple? Haggai 1:9-11# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side but even greater, is to have him with you.# The tabernacle in the middle of the nation was to serve as a reminder of God\u0026rsquo;s presence among the people.# The Lord is not just saying \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to bless you\u0026rdquo;, He\u0026rsquo;s essentially saying, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to dwell with you\u0026rdquo;. I will cohabit with you. I will share my heart with you. Exodus 25:8, Exodus 29:46, 2 Corinthians 6:6# In the Church age, God enters (indwells) the believer through the Person of the Holy Spirit. Yet it is only as we turn to Him or rather, in New Testament vernacular, walk with Him by faith that He richly dwells in us. Acts 17:24, Ephesians 3:17, Colossians 3:16# In the Millennial age, all of Israel will be given hearts that love God and God dwells in the midst of His people. 2 Corinthians 6:16, Ezekiel 36:26# Zechariah 1:4-6 Their fathers returned but never returned to the Lord# In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will clarify what \u0026ldquo;return to Me\u0026rdquo; does not not mean.# Zechariah 1:4a \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers,… Look to your fathers\u0026rsquo; example, don\u0026rsquo;t follow in their footsteps, do not follow their example. 2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8# Zechariah 1:4b to whom the former prophets proclaimed,… God had spoken to them through the prophets. In fact, they had been warned countless times and in countless ways.# The former prophets include; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10# Zechariah 1:4c saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now\u0026hellip;(to Me) Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10# It was not the Lord that needed to return to them first, it was the people that had departed from the Lord and needed to realize their state, change their minds and return to Him.# This is not simply to a formal obedience to His law and covenant. Zechariah was to warn the Israelites not to be like their (pre-exilic) forefathers who refused to respond to the preaching of earlier (pre-exilic) prophets.# This is not saying if Israel would have ceased from sinning, God would have returned. A return to God is not synonymous with sinning less as some teach.# A return meant coming to God without delay on the basis of who He is and His promised Provision for sin\u0026rsquo;s atonement in the coming Messiah.# Zechariah 1:4c \u0026hellip;from your evil ways and from your evil deeds…\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; The fathers, just like Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation, needed to change their minds away from what they trusted in, towards God. Acts 20:21# Zechariah 1:4d *..evil ways and from evil deeds\u0026hellip;*The evidence is conclusive. Their ways and deeds demonstrated the condition of their wayward hearts. Ezekiel 14:5# This may sound like the Lord is saying to stop their evil ways and evil deeds. They should, but that is not the point here.# The point is to convince the people their ways and deeds were a result of a bad relationship with God. Jeremiah 2:13# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s admonishment to his generation is that they learn from the bad example of their forefathers and listen to what the Lord had to say and return to Him. Jeremiah 29:13, Proverbs 3:5, 1 Samuel 12:24# The message contained in this book is intended to do exactly that to the returnees. This is true of subsequent generations as well.# Zechariah 1:4d But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.… The real issue resided in the hearts. They did not listen\u0026hellip;Isaiah 6:10# They were unable to hear God speaking because they didn\u0026rsquo;t listen. They were rebellious and refused to heed the many warnings. Jeremiah 17:23, 29:19, 35:17, 44:5# Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place. A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil things but a return to fellowship.# A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 2 Chronicles 12:14# God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27, Colossians 2:23# God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4# It is counted as violence to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4# In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. Jeremiah 10:2, Acts 28:3-4, Acts 17:23# This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. They arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be rebuilt . Haggai 1:2# Once again, God disciplined them, this time with a drought yet they still did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17# Zechariah 1:5a \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they?… While a small group of them returned, the fathers for the most part had been killed by the Babylonians and died off or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10# Zechariah 1:5b And the prophets, do they live forever?… The prophets were human too and eventually died. Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to.# God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today,# God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvation is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2# Zechariah 1:6a \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,… God raised up prophets to speak His words and His statutes were written down so there would be no mistaking what God said.# *My words\u0026hellip;*The prophet who spoke presumptuously without the Lord commanding Him should not be feared. Deuteronomy 18:18-22, Jeremiah 28:15-17, Deuteronomy 13:5# *My statues\u0026hellip;*These were God given through Moses, and written down. Israel was not to add or take away from them. Deuteronomy 4:1-2, 8# Zechariah 1:6b overtake your fathers?… The words spoken through His servants and the established statutes came to pass as God had said they would. Deuteronomy 28:45# Zechariah 1:6c \u0026hellip;and they returned and said\u0026hellip; (KJV) the word returned (SHUB) is correctly translated \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; in the King James version, and not as the New American Standard Version. It\u0026rsquo;s referring to a physical return from Babylon to the land. Compare the use of SHUB in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6# Zechariah 1:6d As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.… The forefathers served to testify of the veracity of God\u0026rsquo;s word. Their witness is clear, God did as He said He would do. Lamentations 1:18, 2:7# The first temple was destroyed in 586b.C. and the second temple was finished in 516b.C., a gap of 70 years.# The first deportation was in 605b.C. while the first return occured in 536b.C., a 70 year gap.# The returnees were now hearing the word of the Lord through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. The statutes continued to speak the same and now the forefathers testimony as well, gave credence to the importance of heeding the message.# Though a group returned physically, their focus was on the land, the temple and on material blessings. Blessings removed and curses received. Yet they never repented, they never changed their minds from trusting themselves to trusting God.# Jeremiah 7:4 \u0026ldquo;Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, \u0026lsquo;This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; Jeremiah 7:8# This has been referred to as “walking at a guilty distance.” This is not what it means to walk with God. Genesis 6:9# A note about biblical repentance# The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel.# In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe based his translation on Jerome\u0026rsquo;s Latin Bible as his sole source. The Latin vulgate unfortunately had several grave mistranslations, including the Greek word METANOIA (to change one\u0026rsquo;s thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent.# The doctrine of penance was what was being taught by the Roman Church, which required the sinner paying a certain penance in order to be forgiven.# The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel profound sorrow, be penitent) replaced the original Greek word metanoia (change your mind).# We can understand then why sometimes the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, \u0026lsquo;return\u0026rsquo;. Physically they returned. Spiritually they did not.# In this case, the fathers recognized being wrong and that God was punishing them for disobedience. They readily accepted the consequences of their sin (punishment).# Yet they never looked to God. They recognized God as sovereign and the punishment they deserved but their trust was never placed in the Lord. They trusted in fate. Their hope was that God somehow might show mercy on them despite their wrong doings.# This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized.# As the believer fellowships with God, God brings certain things (sin) to light which the believer should confess it to (agree with) God. Yet the basis for fellowship is not confession.# Confession does not access or maintain fellowship, faith does. Confession is what results of repentance (a change of mind) while walking by faith in fellowship with God. He who says he has no sin\u0026hellip;lies and is not fellowshipping with God. 1 John 1# If one has to confess to get back into fellowship with God, the waters of grace are muddied. It is displaced sufficiency of Christ onto the actions of the believer.# More to the point, the people who came to John the Baptist confessing their sin, were believers who were responding to the preaching of repentance. John\u0026rsquo;s baptism was an appropriate response of what God was doing in the hearts of the people through John\u0026rsquo;s message. Mark 1:1-4, Matthew 3:7-8# In like manner, the believer is to confess his sins because his sins have been forgiven. It is not for forgiveness that he confesses, but because he accepts by faith he already has forgiveness. This is aligning, saying the same, to what God says in His word.# Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for all sin not merely for sins that are confessed. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has fully paid for his sin debt (past, present, future) and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God.# If a believer sins, a return to God (a believer who repents) is one who comes to God on the basis of who Christ is and his standing in Christ by faith and thereby providing acceptance before the Father. No amount of confession of sin makes the sinner more or less acceptable before the Father. That was Christ\u0026rsquo;s work. Colossians 2:6# The Jewish forefathers needed approach God by faith. Merely admitting sin and accepting the consequences as from God, is not the same as approaching God by faith which requires resting in God\u0026rsquo;s provision. Ezekiel 20:43# We find a stark contrast between the fathers and Daniel\u0026rsquo;s response when he read the prophecy of Jeremiah regarding the 70 year exile. Daniel 9:15-19# Biblical repentance is not merely admitting you\u0026rsquo;re guilty, it\u0026rsquo;s trusting God\u0026rsquo;s solution. Matthew 27:3-5# Biblical repentance is not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. In fact, the Bible used two very different words for repent and sorrow.# It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow can lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing, one leads to the other. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9# Biblical repentance is not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found anywhere in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven is a promised result of repentance.# Biblical repentance not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic. This is a common misconception that still plagues Christianity today.# The root is a change of mind which is internal. The results may or may not be outward and could be evidenced differently in each case but are not a requirement by God for the internal to be considered authentic. Luke 3:8-18# Salvation is by faith in the Gospel. Salvation is not by works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2:8-9# Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God. You change your thinking from what you were trusting in to trust God alone. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1# In the case of an unbeliever, he or she must change their mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5# Or a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16# The purpose of this message was that God was warning the returning Jews that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not trust Him.# They would be prone to imagine the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and return to Him by faith. Yet the fathers did not.# Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, \u0026ldquo;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote# Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.\u0026rdquo;# Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, \u0026ldquo;Who sees us?\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Who knows us?\u0026rdquo; You turn things around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, \u0026ldquo;He did not make me\u0026rdquo;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, \u0026ldquo;He has no understanding\u0026rdquo;?# James 4:8 “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you\u0026hellip;”.# Following are some examples from the people that Zechariah brings out throughout the book to demonstrate bad believing and their need to change their minds\u0026hellip;# The busy returnees - for about 16 years the people stood by and concluded \u0026ldquo;it was not God\u0026rsquo;s will\u0026rdquo; to rebuild the temple. They each went to building their elaborate homes. Haggai 1:2, 4, 8# The unlistening fathers - This lot persisted playing deaf with God and got deported. Zechariah 1:4-6# The unmoved exiles - The jews who remained in comfort, remaining dispersed in foreign nations. Zechariah 2# The soiled high priest - The priestly garments (ie Joshua\u0026rsquo;s) was soiled. Satan didn\u0026rsquo;t need any other incriminated evidence to bring a charge against God\u0026rsquo;s elect. Clearly, they were guilty. Zechariah 3# The temple whiners - Since the second temple was not as grand as the first, they scorned the building of the second temple. Large or small, when God asks you to get involved it\u0026rsquo;s a grand thing! Zechariah 4# Wickedness in the land - wickedness will have to be removed, why would God have to remove wickedness from the land of a people that \u0026ldquo;deserved\u0026rdquo; God\u0026rsquo;s blessings? Zechariah 5# The redundant mourners - This lot mourned about their losses, only to forget the reason why they lost them in the first place. Zechariah 7-8# The Good Shepherd rejectors - God provided a Shepherd for Israel. He was caring, compassionate and protective of the flock, yet they rejected Him. Zechariah 9# The fleecing shepherds - The people tolerated shepherds who used them for financial gain. Zechariah 11:1-5# Dishonest merchants - These returnees learned Babylonian ways. They used lying and swearing to secure business.# The foolish shepherd followers - The people readily embraced a foolish Shepherd who didn\u0026rsquo;t care about them and didn\u0026rsquo;t protect them. Instead they were slaughtered. Zechariah 11:15-17# Those who pierced the Deliverer - The infamous nation who killed their liberator.# These illustrations serve to cause reflective consideration regarding the people\u0026rsquo;s true spiritual condition. Would they see their utter need and return to Yahweh or continue on the same path as their fathers?# Zechariah 1:7-6:8 - The Second Message: Eight Visions# Three months later, Zechariah received 8 visions in one night. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some parts were fulfilled within the near future but most of the prophecies contained in the visions have yet to be fulfilled even today.# These night visions serve the primary purpose of revealing to the people, God\u0026rsquo;s involvement behind the scenes to make Israel and Judah\u0026rsquo;s return to Him a reality. All of these visions deal with God\u0026rsquo;s nation, Israel and not generally speaking of God\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;people\u0026rsquo;.# These visions serve to encourage the people of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time to finish building the temple. The temple is important for so many reasons within the existence of the Jews but a key reason is so that prophecy regarding Messiah might be fulfilled.# They also serve to give hope to future generations as the visions unveil how God is compassionately and faithfully fighting for Israel and of His plans to make Israel the epicenter of the world.# We will try not to discifer every detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know.# Each of the visions follow a similar pattern.# Zechariah describes what he saw# Zechariah enquires what it means# Zechariah is given the significance# Passage Vision Meaning 1 Zechariah 1:7-17 The horseman God is jealous for Israel. God is prepared to fight the nations for Israel\u0026rsquo;s restoration and bring justice and through it, world peace 2 Zechariah 1:18-21 4 horns and 4 craftsmen The nations who have scattered Israel will ultimately be thrown down 3 Zechariah 2:1-13 Measuring Jerusalem Jerusalem will be restored 4 Zechariah 3:1-10 Joshua high priest The priesthood is reinstated 5 Zechariah 4:1-14 The lampstand Zerubbabel is encouraged, the temple will be rebuilt 6 Zechariah 5:1-4 The flying scroll Righteous judgement on God\u0026rsquo;s people 7 Zechariah 5:5-11 The ephah Wickedness removed from the land and taken to Shinar 8 Zechariah 6:1-8 Four chariots The enemy nations are judged and destroyed Zechariah 6:9-15 A Crown of crowns fit for The King Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the horseman# Zechariah 1:7-8 The Vision# Zechariah 1:7a On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, Three months after receiving the first message, Zechariah receives a second communication from the Lord.# Zechariah 1:7b which is the month Shebat, Since Zechariah lives in a Persian/Babylonian/Hebrew culture, he gives the Aramaic month name as well. Shebat is the adapted Babylonian name for the eleventh month.# This is January-February, the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel.# Zechariah 1:7c in the second year of Darius, Though Medo-Persia had years of trouble after Cyrus died, by his second year, Darius managed to bring the empire to stability and peace.# \u0026ldquo;Darius boasted that in nineteen battles he had defeated nine rebel leaders and had subdued all his enemies. So the empire was again virtually quiet by 520 B.C.\u0026rdquo;[7] # Zechariah 1:7d the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, again, Zechariah gives his credentials. This may have been because these were separate messages that were later compiled into one book of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecies.# This day (24 Shebat) marked 5 months since the rebuilding of the temple had begun. Haggai 1:14-15, 2:10, 18, 20# Zechariah 1:7-8a \u0026hellip;as follows: I saw at night, This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of visions in the night.# This was not a dream. Zechariah was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was how God many times communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6# Zechariah 1:8b and behold, a man was riding\u0026hellip;This man is the only rider mentioned and appears to take a more prominent role.# Who is this rider? We are later told he is the angel of the Lord. We will discuss this later in verse 11.# Zechariah 1:8c \u0026hellip;on a red horse, we cannot be dogmatic since the the angel does not say, but generally speaking red symbolizes bloodshed, many times as a result of war.# Horses then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in the context of war. Cavalry was highly regarded by many civilizations during this time.# In Revelation 6:4 we also see a red horse who comes to take peace and cause war and bloodshed.# Zechariah 1:8d and he was standing among the myrtle trees It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees.# Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther\u0026rsquo;s Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7# Myrtle branches are used during the celebration of the Feast of Booths. Nehemiah 8:15, Isaiah 41:19, 55:13# In the Millennial age, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19# Zechariah 1:8e which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Red, sorrel and white horses behind him.# These horses probably symbolize angelic beings as they were God\u0026rsquo;s representatives sent to \u0026ldquo;patrol the earth\u0026rdquo;.# Persian monarchs used messengers on swift steeds to keep them informed on all matters concerning their empire. [8] # Zechariah 1:9a The Question# Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know what it was that he saw.# Zechariah 1:9b-17 The Interpretation# Zechariah 1:9b And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor\u0026rsquo;s task to guess what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1# Zechariah 1:10a And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, The man standing enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 1:10b \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; The horses here most likely represent angelic beings sent by the Lord.# This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7# We know from Job 1:6-7 that angelic beings are roaming the earth.# Zechariah 1:11a So they answered the angel of the LORD This is the first mention of \u0026ldquo;the angel of the Lord\u0026rdquo; in Zechariah.# The angel of the LORD can be seen about 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article the helps identify He is a singular being.# The only adequate interpretation for this being as seen here as well as other portions of Scripture, is that it is referring to the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus Christ.# The angel of the Lord was the Lord Himself, the second person of the Trinity.# This “man among the myrtle trees” appears to be the same as the angel of the Lord Zechariah 1:11–13# The Angel of the Lord shows up six times in Zechariah. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8# The angel of the Lord had an intercessory role throughout the Old Testament. Zechariah 1:12, 12:8, Exodus 14:19; 33:14; Isaiah 13:9; 1 Corinthians 10:4# The angel of the Lord removed Joshua the priest\u0026rsquo;s filthy garments and gave him new clothes symbolizing the preparation for temple service before the Lord.# The angel of the Lord is Yahweh but shown distinct from Yahweh in other passages. The following Scriptures illustrate how the writers showed the angel of the Lord to be Yahweh but yet distinct from Yahweh. 2 Samuel 24:16; Zechariah 1:12# He gives comfort to Hagar. Genesis 16:7, 11# He calls Moses. The angel of the Lord is Yahweh. Exodus 3:1-6# He stopped Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. Genesis 22:11-12, 15-16# To talk sense to Balaam. Numbers 22:31, 35, 38# To prepare Gideon for battle. Judges 6:12-13, 22# David was terrified by His sword. 1 Chronicles 21:18, 27, 30# Genesis 3:15 tells us that God will raise up a deliverer, who is to be a man, born of the woman who will crush Satan.# Zechariah reveals to us something more about the angel of the Lord.# He mentions twice in this passage that He is a man. Zechariah 1:8, 10# He removes iniquity. Zechariah 3:1, 4# Did Zechariah see Jesus in the future? Or perhaps he actually saw the angel of the Lord before he put on humanity but was identifying# Zechariah states twice that the angel of the Lord is a standing. Zechariah 1:8, 10# Stephen saw Jesus standing when he was being stoned. Acts 7:55-56# Jesus is seen standing when he receives the scroll in Heaven. Revelation 5:6# Jesus will be seen standing on mount Zion when He returns. Revelation 14:1# We therefore conclude that according to Zechariah and supportive Scriptures that the identity of the Angel of the Lord (capitalized from now on) is God the son, the second person of the Trinity.# The book of Zechariah presents Christ as:# The Angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:11# The man. Zechariah 1:10, 1:11, 13:7# The Branch. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12# God\u0026rsquo;s Associate. Zechariah 13:7# The Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7# Priest. Zechariah 6:13# The King. Zechariah 9:9, 14:16, Isaiah 6:5, John 12:41# The Redeemer. Zechariah 9:11# God\u0026rsquo;s Servant. Zechariah 3:8# The Stone. Zechariah 3:7, 10:4# The tent peg. Zechariah 10:4# Lord of the whole earth. Zechariah 4:14, Revelation 11:4# The Lord of Hosts. Zechariah 14:16# God\u0026rsquo;s servant, the Branch is a man, who will build the Temple of the Lord. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12, Isaiah 11:1, Isaiah 60:21, Jeremiah 23:5, Jeremiah 33:15, Revelation 22:16# God\u0026rsquo;s Associate the man. Zechariah 13:7# Genesis 3:15 - A male seed of the woman, Matthew 1:23, Galatians 4:4 - but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law (Darby)# John 1:14 - The eternal God put on humanity. He was fully God and fully human. Revelation 22:13, 16# Christ was interceding on behalf of Israel before he became a man. He didn\u0026rsquo;t need to put on humanity to intercede. He had to put on humanity to pay man\u0026rsquo;s sin debt and become a substitute.# The Angel of the Lord who will one day destroy the nations that go up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8# Zechariah 1:11b They answered the man \u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, These horses went to gather intel regarding the current political climate of the earth.# Obviously the horses symbolize something. We are not told if they have riders, nor what their colors mean.# Zechariah 1:11c and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; In the second year of Darius there prevailed universal peace; all the nations of the earlier Chaldaean empire were at rest, and lived in undisturbed prosperity. [9] # Peaceful (YASHAB) is to dwell or settle at ease. Genesis 20:15, Genesis 25:27# Quiet (SHAQAT) describes a state of undisturbed tranquility. It is a condition during the absence of war. Judges 3:30# To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026ldquo;Peace at last, All is well!\u0026rdquo;. However this report is not received well by the Angel of the Lord.# Zechariah 1:12a Then the Angel of the LORD said, Instead of the interpreting angel answering Zechariah, the angel of the Lord asks a question to the Lord of hosts.# Zechariah 1:12b \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, The Angel of the Lord addresses the Lord of hosts, asking the duration of the discipline on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. Jeremiah 25:11-12# We are reminded of Habakkuk’s cry to the Lord before Judah was taken into exile\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;How long, Lord, have I called for help, And You do not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save.\u0026rdquo;# The Gentile nations were at peace at the expense of violence done to God\u0026rsquo;s nation Israel.# There is sense of total indifference on behalf of the nations towards Israel\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty. Nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to posess their land within the quiet peace at the time.# Even today, Israel is treated with contempt.# The only reason the Lord allows it to play out is because God desires Israel to return to Him. So as long as Israel is in a state of unbelief, we can expect the absence of peace for the land of Israel.# There is a difference between the kind of peaceful silence the world was experiencing at that time and the peace (SHALOM) which Messiah will bring in.# SHALOM comes from the rood word SHALAM.# In the translation of Exodus 21-22, SHALAM is translated as “make it good”, “shall surely pay”, “make full restitution” or to “restore”. The ancient Hebrew meaning of SHALAM was “to make something whole”. Not just regarding practical restoration of things that were lost or stolen. But with an overall sense of fulness and completeness in mind, body and estate. [10] # Genesis 43:27-28 “Then he asked them about their well-being [SHALOM], and said, “Is your father well [SHALOM], the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” And they answered, “Your servant our father is in good health [SHALOM]; he is still alive.” NKJV# Messiah will bring in shalom between the offices of priest and king. Zechariah 6:13# Messiah will bring shalom to the land. Zechariah 8:12# Messiah will speak shalom to the nations. Zechariah 9:10# Messiah\u0026rsquo;s name will be prince of shalom. Isaiah 9:6-7# True, world shalom will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne in Jerusalem. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4# World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deeded her, Babylon is utterly destroyed and the Prince of Peace is reigning on His throne in Jerusalem. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5# Zechariah 1:12b \u0026hellip;with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; God is shown to be in control of Israel\u0026rsquo;s time, not the Gentile nations. God had said the time would be 70 years.# The Angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s words reflect his compassion for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026ldquo;at peace\u0026rdquo;.# The Angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s part here perfectly anticipates Jesus\u0026rsquo; role as Intercessor for His people.# Zechariah 1:13 The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. We are told the sovereign Lord of the universe responds with kind, comforting words, but we\u0026rsquo;re not told what those words were. Colossians 4:6# Psalm 94:19 When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations delight my soul.# Isaias 35:4 Say to those with anxious heart, \u0026ldquo;Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 1:14a So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, Just like the first message, this message was not to be kept hidden, it was to be proclaimed to the people.# As a prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2# So, this is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12# Zechariah 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous\u0026hellip; The Lord reminds his people \u0026ldquo;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!\u0026rdquo; God has a strong devotion towards his possession, Israel. Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7# His disposition goes beyond what we hear when it is said, \u0026ldquo;God has a plan for you, he wants to bless you\u0026rdquo;. We must realize that God is jealously seeking his possession unto himself to not share with anyone or anything else. God is willing to go to great lengths, even to war against the nations because he desires a people unto himself.# This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seemed God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel.# Zechariah 1:14c for Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture we see Zion used synonymously with Jerusalem. Here Zion should be understood as even more specific.# The earth is at the center of creation. Israel is the central nation of the world. Jerusalem is the central city in Israel. Zion is the mountain in Jerusalem where the temple will be built. Micah 3:12# The term, Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Micah 4:1# Zion is the mountain on which Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6# Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Micah 4:2# Zion can also refer to God\u0026rsquo;s people. Zechariah 2:7, 2:10# Zechariah 1:15a \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; The nations were at ease with the current circumstances of Israel.# The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not possess her land. They have done nothing but oppress Israel.# Zechariah 1:15b for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; God was angry with the fathers but now the nations have angered God even more. Zechariah 1:2# Israel\u0026rsquo;s exile a disaster because it was unnecessary. Yet the response of the nations made the calamity even worse.# The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent peace and requests to know how much longer the status quo would be permitted to go on.# The Lord had warned the nations (especially in the case the Chaldeans) they would be judged for the way they treated of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34‑35, Amos 6:1# Zechariah 1:16a \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; Because of the injustice by the Gentile nations, God will symbolically return his presence to Jerusalem with compassion.# Zechariah 1:16b My house will be built in it\u0026hellip; the rebuilding of the temple is foretold here. The temple will be completed.# Temples in the Bible# Temple Timeframe 1 1st - Solomon\u0026rsquo;s 958b.C. - 586 2 2nd - Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s 515b.C.-70a.D. Mount Gerizim (Samaritans) 450b.C.-110 3 3rd - Tribulation temple Near end of tribulation 4 4th - The Messiah\u0026rsquo;s Temple Millennium - New Jerusalem House or temple (BAYITH) appears 31 times in Zechariah.# It can refer to a physical building.# God\u0026rsquo;s Temple. Zechariah 1:16, 3:7, 4:9, 7:3, 8:9, 11:13, 14:20, 14:21# The temple in Shinar. Zechariah 5:11# A dwelling for a person. Zechariah 6:10, 14:2# It can refer to a family or people. For instance, the house of Judah or the house of Israel. Zechariah 8:13, 8:15, 8:19, 10:3, 10:6, 12:4, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:12, 12:13, 13:1# It can refer to a religious system. Zechariah 7:3, 13:6, 5:4# Zechariah 1:16c declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; the rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been astounding to hear especially while the city lied ruins.# About 200 years earlier, God had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would raise up someone to deliver them from Babylon and Jerusalem would be built.# Isaiah 44:28 It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; .# Zechariah adds to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be finished. Zechariah 4:9-10# Zechariah 1:17a \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion. Psalm 132:13# The Lord of hosts promises overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15# While the prophecy of verse 16 finds its fulfilment in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.# Overflowing prosperity in the land and the Lord comforting Zion will come about after Israel returns to the Lord. Zechariah 13:9# Zechariah 1:17 and again choose Jerusalem\u0026hellip; God will once again place his attention on Jerusalem. Zechariah 2:12, 8:8, 13:9# What does it mean to once again choose Jerusalem?# 70 years prior, God removed the people from the land. They were exiled to a foreign land. There was no mention of Jerusalem as God had intended her.# Though the priests garments soil their garments, though Israel was unfaithful, the nation continued to be God\u0026rsquo;s chosen vessel. Zechariah 3:2# God sovereignly chose the nation of Israel for the purpose of carrying out his redemptive plan for humanity and earthly restoration. 2 Chronicles 6:6# Zechariah 1:18-21 A Vision of four horns \u0026amp; four craftsmen# Zechariah 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Zechariah became suddenly aware of four horns.# Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. In verse 21 we see it was nations lifted up their horns against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17# Zechariah 1:19a So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah did not readily understand what the meaning of what he saw.# He saw horns but he realized they symbolize something. He asks the interpreting angel what they are.# Zechariah 1:19b And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; These horns (typically powers or empires) are identified as having scattered the people.# Differing opinion exist as to the identity of the horns.# Option 1: Nations in the past. Assyria, Egypt, Babylonia, and Medo-Persia—are in view here.# Option 2: The 4 empires of the Times of the Gentiles mentioned in Daniel. Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that oppress Israel. Ezekiel 34:11-31# The second option seems best although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel\u0026rsquo;s prophecy would probably associate these 4 horns with Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome.# The identity of the horns is not stated\u0026hellip;yet they clearly portray total domination of the people of Israel by the powers that attacked and conquered them. [^11]# Zechariah 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah needed to know what the 4 horns were. When he sees the craftsmen coming, he asks what they would do.# A craftsman is a skillful artisan. He is known by what he does with his hands. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31# Zechariah 1:21b And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head; through oppression, sorrow, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15# This was Judah\u0026rsquo;s current condition even though they were allowed back into the land. They still lived under the domination of Medo-Persia at the time.# Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot until the end of the \u0026ldquo;Times of the Gentiles\u0026rdquo;.# Zechariah 1:21c but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, The artisans come to cause these nations to shudder.# Zechariah 1:21d to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; The enemy nations will be dealt with accordingly. Jeremiah 50:45-46# to throw down - is one word in Hebrew (YADAW) meaning to cast out. Just like these nations caused Judah to be sent away, so too these craftsmen come to cast these nations away.# Even though the horns had scattered Judah, God told Zechariah the four craftsmen who would come to throw them down.# Some suggest these craftsmen are the very successors to the horns. For instance, the first craftsman would be Medo-Persia casting out Babylon.# The final craftsman in this case would be none other than Messiah himself who comes and casts out the last of the four horns.# This vision served to encourage Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord ultimately had the stronger hand over the nations.# Zechariah 2:1-13 A vision of measuring Jerusalem# Zechariah 2:1a Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold\u0026hellip; No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a man who had an# Zechariah 2:1b \u0026hellip;there was a man with a a measuring line in his hand. Though not the angel of the Lord, there is a similar angel with the form of a man in Ezekiel 40:3; 41; 42; in another connection it is seen in Revelation 11:1-2# Zechariah 2:2a So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Interestingly, the vision is such that Zechariah interacts with the person in the vision.# Zechariah was puzzled as to where he was going.# Zechariah 2:2b And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to measure Jerusalem.# Zechariah was in Jerusalem that had been abandoned for 70 years. Zechariah 7:14, Ezekiel 33:28# Nehemiah mentions the conditions the city was in\u0026hellip;The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire.\u0026rdquo; Nehemiah 1:3, 2:17# Zechariah 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him\u0026hellip;, While Zechariah is still considering where the man (angel) is going to measure, another angel heads out to meet him.# Zechariah 2:4a and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting angel to run!# Zechariah 2:4b \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. The urgent message was that one day Jerusalem would be filled with multitudes of men and cattle.# Though the date of fulfillment is not stated, it would have been of great encouragement that day!# Knowing of Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s future prosperity would promote the rebuilding of the temple.# Such an increase in population as here predicted could not come from the return of a large number of Jews from Babylon; it looks on to a far future day, indicated in verse 5. [12] # Zechariah 2:5a \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for walls.# Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy attacks. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3# Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it\u0026rsquo;s even harder to see her not needing walls.# Just like God would be the walls around a prosperous Jerusalem in the future, so could God be the walls of protection around a tattered one. By faith, trusting in God\u0026rsquo;s protection, Judah was safe because the Lord of hosts was for them to rebuild the temple.# Zechariah 2:5b and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem herself but God in her midst. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11# What a delightful future hope Judah is given. In the very spot where Zechariah was standing, would one day be filled with people and animals. God would be the protecting wall around her and the glory in her midst. Psalm 46:5# Zechariah 2:6-13 Poem of God’s wrath upon the nations# Zechariah 2:6-9 The unmoved exiles# Zechariah 2:6 \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# The land of the north is probably referring to Babylon. Jeremiah 6:22; 16:16# Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem but you had to go north out of Israel to get there.# This was directed to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not warning them flee and return to the land.# This began then but continues today due to the lethargic response of the people who got decided to remain in their foreign lands.# Zechariah 2:7 \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; Two religious systems are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.# The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the children of the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17# This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Revelation 17:5# The command is for God\u0026rsquo;s people to flee the idolatrous of Babylon which has covered the four winds of earth.# Zechariah 2:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10, Psalm 105:15# blessings and curses fall on nations based on their treatment of Israel. Nobody touches her and gets away with it. He is her defender. Jeremiah 2:3, Revelation 17:14# Since the nations had plundered them, God would manifest glory by plundering them.# The Lord does not visit judgment on Israel’s plunderers after He is dwelling in Zion, but before it. Zechariah 12-14; Revelation 16-20# Zechariah 2:9a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately shatter them like earthenware and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2# In a show of power, God will make these nations (them) to serve Israel (their slaves). One day Israel will be the greatest nation on earth. Isaiah 14:2, Zephaniah 2:9# Zechariah 2:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. A most important aspect of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled.# Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;you will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo; Exodus 6:7# The phrase \u0026ldquo;you will know\u0026rdquo; occurs 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know it was God because God had told them. Zechariah 2:9, 11, 4:9, 6:15# Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no doubt of its fulfillment. Ezekiel 12:20, Zechariah 4:9, John 8:28# Zechariah 2:10-11 - The discouraged returnees# Zechariah 2:10a \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; The daughter of Zion (God\u0026rsquo;s people) needed to rejoice instead of bemoaning their current circumstances with their heads hung low.# Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9# Zechariah 2:10b for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. This is a Messianic prophecy. One day, Messiah Zechariah 1:16,# Dwell (SHAKAN) conveys the idea of residing or permanently staying.# Zechariah 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.# Zechariah uses a term \u0026lsquo;in that day\u0026rsquo; 19 times throughout the book. It can refer to the period of time defined by the context but also it can refer to a specific period known as The Day of the Lord.# This is a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel\u0026rsquo;s rule.# The Day of the Lord - a brief explanation# The Day of the Lord is a major eschatological theme. It is a common topic in both New and Old Testaments.# Of the 19 uses of \u0026lsquo;in that day\u0026rsquo; in the book of Zechariah, 16 of those times are in chapters 12-14. We\u0026rsquo;ve listed those we believe refer to The Day of the Lord in the order of their appearance.# The nations will be united to the Lord# Zechariah 2:11 \u0026ldquo;*Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people\u0026hellip;*Zechariah 13:9# There will be prosperity and safety# Zechariah 3:10 *\u0026hellip;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree\u0026hellip;*Micah 4:4, Jeremiah 31:5, 32:15,# Zechariah 9:16-17 *\u0026hellip;God will save them in that day As the flock of His people\u0026hellip;*Zechariah 12:8,# The Lord of hosts goes to battle against the nations, protecting Jerusalem# Zechariah 12:3 *\u0026hellip;I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples\u0026hellip;*Joel 3:2, 9-15, Revelation 19, Obadiah 1:15# Zechariah 12:4 \u0026hellip;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness.

During Millennium there will be fishing there.# Zechariah 14:9 \u0026hellip;the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. Deuteronomy 6:4, Habakkuk 2:14,# Zechariah 14:13 *\u0026hellip;a great panic from the LORD will fall on them\u0026hellip;*Mark 13:8# Integral worship to the Lord# Zechariah 14:20 *\u0026hellip;there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;*Revelation 20:6# Zechariah 14:21 \u0026hellip;there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day. Zephaniah 3:17# The Day of the Lord is like a Jewish day.# It begins at sundown with the Tribulation period. Zephaniah 1:14-18# The second coming at the break of dawn. Zechariah 14:1-4# Mid-day is during the Millennial Kingdom. 2 Peter 3:10, 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 2 Peter 3:10# Sundown is the Great White Throne judgment. Revelation 20# The day of the Lord begins sometime after the rapture. 1 Thessalonians 1:10, 5:9, 2 Thessalonians 2:3# Specifically, when a peace treaty is signed with Antichrist. This begins the Tribulation period. Daniel 9:27# The day of the Lord ends with the Great White Throne. Revelation 20# The nature of the Day# The overarching element in the Day of the Lord is judgment.# God will pour out His wrath starting on Israel.# God will pour out His wrath on the nations according to their treatment of Israel.# The use of fire is seen throughout.# Revelation 8:5,7,9:18, 14:18, 16:8 17:16, Revelation 18:8, 20:9, Ezekiel 38:22, Joel 2:3, Joel 2:30, 2 Thessalonians 1:7# Obviously James and John were out of line when they asked if they should call out fire from heaven, but where would the disciples get this idea from? They knew one day the Lord will judge the earth with fire. Luke 9:54# Events contained within the Day of the Lord# The formation of a federation of nations into a revived Roman Empire. Daniel 2:7# The rise of the Antichrist. Daniel 9:27, Revelation 13:1-10# The formation of a one world religion. Revelation 13:11-18# The seal judgments.

John 6:39-40, Revelation 20:4# The Beast and the False Prophet cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 19:11-21# The Sheep and Goats Judgment. Matthew 25# The binding of Satan for 1000 years. Revelation 20:2-3# The Millennium. Revelation 20# The final rebellion of Satan. Revelation 20# The Great White Throne Judgment. Revelation 20# The Day of the Lord is referring to a future period of time when God begins working with Israel as a nation and ends with its ultimate restoration.# Zechariah 2:11b Then I will dwell in your midst\u0026hellip; The rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem is ultimately for God\u0026rsquo;s dwelling place to be established. From here He will dwell with Israel and reign over the whole earth.# God dwelling in their midst is what the tabernacle and temple symbolized. Exodus 25:8# Zechariah 2:11c and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Messiah, God himself, in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day dwell in their midst forever.# In the person of Christ, God will literally dwell among His people in Jerusalem. Zechariah 8:3, Ezekiel 48:8,# Zechariah 2:12 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.# Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God\u0026rsquo;s people.# They did not walk with God as a nation in keeping the covenant, and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25# Zechariah 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4# Zechariah 3:1-10 A vision of Joshua the high priest# Zechariah sees Jeshua being accused before the Lord# Zechariah 3:1a Then he showed me Joshua the high priest as a priest, Zechariah would have known Joshua well.# Zechariah 3:1b standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. This setting reminds us of Job. Job was blameless before people and the Lord brings him up.# This time, Satan brings up Joshua the High priest and accuse him before the angel of the LORD Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; 1 Chronicles 21:1; Revelation 12:10# Zechariah 3:2a The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! This preincarnate altercation between Christ and Satan shows the ongoing battle that wages on throughout history.# Zechariah 3:2b the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusation is directed against Joshua who symbolizes Jerusalem.# Zechariah 3:2c Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Israel was plucked out the fire. Not once, not twice, but many times.# In context perhaps this is referring to being delivered from Babylon.# Zechariah 3:3a Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments This was Joshua\u0026rsquo;s condition representing the priesthood and all of Israel. There was no need for Satan to try to find something, the situation was obvious. The stench of the soiled garments alone gives him away.# Zechariah saw Joshua standing before the angel of the LORD dressed in excrement bespattered garments. Isaiah 4:4[13] # Filthy garments did not symbolize the criminal in Israel, but one in the pollution of sin. [14] # Isaiah 64:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.# Zechariah 3:3b-4a and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him,# Zechariah 3:4b saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Joshua represents the current state of Israel.# What a delightful scene to see the Angel of the Lord defending Joshua and exchanging his filthy clothes for clean ones.# Zechariah 3:4c Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; If dirty clothes symbolized iniquity, then festal robes must mean righteousness as a result of being fully forgiven.# Isaiah 61:10 I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.# This is a spiritual transformation by divine interaction. From being in a state of feeling shame to feeling accepted. Micah 7:18-19, Isaiah 51:2# Zechariah (being a priest himself) can\u0026rsquo;t contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on and exclaims\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 3:5a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; The priestly garment included a turban. Leviticus 8:9# clean (TAHOR) - implies the sense of purity.# The mitre or turban of the high priest had fastened to it the plate of gold engraved with the words “Holiness to the Lord.” Exodus 28:36-38[15] # Zechariah 3:5b So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. Zechariah as priest is seen intervening on behalf of Joshua.# This is so essential to the message of grace then and now.# It was the Lord who removed unrighteousness. Joshua the priest, even the high priest, took no part whatsoever.# Joshua did not confess his sin. It was the angel of the Lord who took the initiative based on God\u0026rsquo;s covenant.# It was God who clothed Him with festal robes. The dress goes beyond being acceptable, they are appropriate for service to the Lord. These were the robes for festal worship!# The same is true today for the Church age saint. We have been clothed in the righteousness of Christ. His righteousness has been imputed to our account. This is justification.# We can fall prey to Satan\u0026rsquo;s accusations and enter a downward spiral of self-condemnation. Doubt and discouragement are sure to follow. Jude 1:20-23# There is no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus. Jude 1:24-25# Christian, wear your festal robes with rejoicing!# Zechariah 3:6-7a And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, The admonishment comes after the Lord has defended him and taken away His iniquity.# The priesthood is reinstated# Zechariah 3:7b \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, having been cleansed, having had their sins taken away by the Lord, now Joshua is told to walk in God\u0026rsquo;s ways and in His service.# As Joshua stands before the Lord in festal robes, he is admonished by the Lord to walk in His ways as a representative of who He is.# Here we that twice the condition \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; is given. This is a responsibility given to Joshua. He is to walk in God\u0026rsquo;s ways and perform His service.# Unfortunately, we so often hear that cleansing only comes after we remove our sin or if we try hard enough not to sin.# Acceptance before God is not earned through service. Service to God is the outworking of the acceptance one already has before the Lord.# *If\u0026hellip;you will walk\u0026hellip;*the first condition was of a personal nature. Joshua was to have regard for his personal walk with the Lord first and foremost.# *If\u0026hellip;you will perform\u0026hellip;*the second condition was then to perform ministerial service of the temple.# Joshua is being charged to walk with God in fellowship in order for ministerial service to take place. God is reestablishing the priestly duties under the Mosaic covenant.# Zechariah 3:7c then you will also govern My house\u0026hellip; The Lord of Hosts gave the priests the responsibility to govern the temple so long as they walked in His ways. Ezekiel 44:15-16# govern (DIN) - this carries with it the idea of judging.# If\u0026hellip;then you will govern My house\u0026hellip;refers to the Temple then in building. The duties of the priests included deciding and judging between clean and unclean. Leviticus 10:8, 10, Deuteronomy 17:9, Ezekiel 44:23, and Malachi 2:7 [16] # Ironically, when the Lord Jesus came, He confronted the hypocrisy of the chief priests and removed all doubt that they had lost this privilege for their failure to keep the first clause, \u0026ldquo;if you will walk in my ways\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. Matthew 21:23-27# Zechariah 3:7d and also have charge of My courts\u0026hellip; the courts must refer to that which took place in the event of quarrels. The religious leaders were to act as judges and deal with fairness and justice.# The courts, too, had to be guarded from profanation; care had to be exercised as to the kind of persons who were to be allowed to enter.[17] # Zechariah 3:7e and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest.# This was possible only to priests who were ritually and morally pure. Exodus 40:30-33# The conditions were put as to the condition of experience and service, not acceptance.# Governing things regarding the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in His ways first and foremost.# In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5# Prior to ministry service, the church age saint is first to be walking in fellowship, abiding in Christ. John 15:4-5, Romans 8:12-13# It is the spiritual believer, learning from the Word through the teaching of the Spirit, that is equipped for the ministry of service. Ephesians 4:11-12# Zechariah 3:8a \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.# Zechariah 3:8b you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends refers to the priesthood.# They set apart to be a type or symbolize what God will one day provide in a perfect Priest from a higher order.# While Joshua and his colleges would serve in the earthly temple, Christ who entered the Holy of Holies in heaven, who is seated at the right hand of the father, will one day serve in the Millennial temple as the Priest and King.# Zechariah 3:8a for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. What this is saying that the temple service of the priests was prophet and to be fulfilled by God\u0026rsquo;s Servant, the Branch.# My servant. Clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5; Luke 11:37-54; Isaiah 42:1, 49:3, 50:10, 52:13, 53:11; Ezekiel 34:23-24; Philippians 2:6-8# The Branch (sprout) is a man, who will build the Temple of the Lord. Zechariah 3:8; Isaiah 11:1; Isaiah 60:21; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:15; Revelation 22:16; Isaiah 4:2, 11:1; 53:2, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15# It will be the Branch will build the Millennial temple, which is unlike any other temple. Zechariah 6:12-13# Zechariah 3:9a \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. This addition is very interesting\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;before Joshua\u0026rdquo; the stone.# Here we see a third name for Messiah, the stone. While we know Christ is the prophesied cornerstone. Genesis 49:24, Psalm 118:22; Isaiah 28:16; Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11; and 1 Peter 2:6# Zechariah adds descriptive information to the stone. It has seven eyes, probably referring to the attribute of omniscience the Messiah will possess.# These may be the same seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.# Daniel, when describing the characteristics of Antichrist states he has eyes like a man\u0026rsquo;s. Daniel 7:8, 11:21, Zechariah 11:17# Zechariah 3:9b Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.# While the work of the cross is implied here and certainly the iniquity of the land being removed is on the basis of the victory acquired by Messiah on the cross, it is not referring to that here. Hebrews 10:10, 12, 14# This is the day, the very day iniquity is removed of the land\u0026hellip;that is\u0026hellip;the day of her forgiveness when all of Israel will place their faith in Jesus Messiah.# This is a once for all event. There will be no need for a repetition or renewal; His work will be once for all.# Zechariah 3:10a \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor\u0026hellip;# When Israel is found in such a spiritual condition-so reads the united testimony of the Old Testament, material prosperity is always promised her. [18] # Thus we read of the peace and prosperity of the time in verse 10. 1 Kings 4:25, Micah 4:4# Zechariah 3:10b to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is an image of peace and blessing will be like in the kingdom age due to their iniquity being absolved.# Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakkuk 3:17# This vision is regarding Joshua the high priest as he stands accused before the Angel of the Lord. Joshua represents the priesthood and It appears to be the reaffirming of the priests for typical service until the Messiah would come to build His temple.# If the spiritual leadership of Judah needed encouraging, no doubt the civil leadership did as well. The next vision will deal with that.# Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold# The following vision is directed for Zerubbabel.# Who is Zerubbabel?# The civil governor of Judah# Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ. Matthew 1:6, 12# His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge.# Zechariah 4:1 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. The word then shows this vision came afterward. Since the vision was at night, the interpreting angel roused Zechariah so he was wide awake when receiving the vision.# Zechariah 4:2a He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks\u0026hellip;# Many who make no distinction between the Church and Israel (a demarcation which is one of the clearest in the Bible), think the figure stands for the Church. [19] # It is true that lampstands are used as a figure of the Church in Revelation 1:12, 20, and that the Church is compared to lights in Philippians 2:15, but the Church is not a matter of prophecy in the Old Testament. [20] # The Church is foretold for the first time in the New Testament. Matthew 16:18# Zechariah 4:2b and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Exodus 25:37# Zechariah 4:3 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:4 Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said,\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:6a Then he said to me,\u0026hellip;we note the particular build-up and suspense for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained.# Zechariah 4:6b \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,\u0026hellip; this is a specific message to Zerubbabel.# We know from the prophet Ezra that Zerubbabel listened and followed what God commanded. Ezra 5:2# Therefore this message is of a different tone than it was to the people in general. Zechariah is of a sincere nature but evidently is trying to bring about results in his own strength.# Zechariah 4:6c \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,\u0026hellip;\u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip;# As a chosen leader, Zerubbabel must have had natural talents and abilities. Yet God is saying not civil, political, physical, natural or any kind of human power but God says the temple building will be brought about by His Spirit.# God is offering Zerubbabel an option that perhaps Zerubbabel had been too busy to even consider. God says this, what about trusting My power to be your strength?# The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they began rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14# This is a wonderful illustration to show how God wants us to live as Christians. The teaching of God\u0026rsquo;s grace is what instructs us how to really live; to trust, to depend on God for His strength (My Spirit) not our own (power). Titus 2:11-12# All believers get their enabling strengthening by grace. Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2# The grace of God teaches God\u0026rsquo;s full provision for salvation from sin\u0026rsquo;s penalty and for the provision of daily living being delivered from sin\u0026rsquo;s power, while pointing to the amazing hope of our final redemption.# This is certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026ldquo;ease does not produce strength\u0026rdquo;. They teach that one must find strength through spiritual disciplines.# God\u0026rsquo;s power certainly does not lack man\u0026rsquo;s strength and He freely bestows it to those believers who take Him up on the option to trust Him. 1 Samuel 14:6, Hosea 1:7, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, Hebrews 11:34, 2 Corinthians 4:7# The lampstand symbolizes Israel when she is fully restored as the means of light fueled by the Holy Spirit (the unending supply of oil), unto the world. Exodus 19:6# They were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. This summarizes chapters 3 and 4.# Zechariah 4:7a \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; Mountains can symbolize different things in Scripture.# In this case the mountain is how Zerubbabel sees his current situation. The obstacles are a great mountain.# Yet nothing is too great for the man who has the Lord of Hosts battling for him. A weak man who is God\u0026rsquo;s instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable by the impossible!# The task Zerubbabel is given is from first to last a spiritual work, it must be by the omnipotent and unfailing and unerring Spirit of God.# Zechariah 4:7b and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is what is placed at the end of a building to complete it.# Zerubbabel will see the temple finished, but not the way he might have thought.# The shouting of grace to the Messiah would be meaningless. The idea is that the grace of God in the power of the Holy Spirit will make this work to be realized. Not by God\u0026rsquo;s intervention, not man\u0026rsquo;s might but by God\u0026rsquo;s power enabling the human vessel who trusts Him!# The shouts at the end are grace, grace not “Zerubba, Zerubba!”. The people will credit the completion to be thanks to God\u0026rsquo;s working. To God is the glory when God motivates and strengthens His laborious unto His work! Ezra 6:14# God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit glorifies God, not our strength (might, prowess, ability, wisdom). The shouts of grace, grace, demonstrates trust in God for the results.# Our incompetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work when we trust Him. The evidence\u0026hellip;God brought it about! This is God using Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s hands as instruments to bring glory to himself. To God is the glory!# One day all of Israel will recognize the high cost that needed to be paid for their redemption and they will see their Savior as the one they pierced. The value of grace is understood only upon the realization of the payment Christ made. Zechariah 12:10, John 19:34, Acts 2:32, 36-37# Zechariah 4:8-9a Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Haggai 2:23# Once the rebuilding started back up, it took 4 years and 3 months for this promise to be literally fulfilled. Ezra 6:15# The second temple was finished 70 years after the first one was destroyed.# Zechariah 4:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Me is not Zechariah but Messiah.# This is the people rejoicing in response, giving credence to God\u0026rsquo;s provision.# Zechariah 4:10a \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things?# The second temple wasn\u0026rsquo;t as glorious as the first. The older generation that had seen Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple were sorely disappointed.# When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with raw materials. He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world.# On the other hand, Zurabbabel had God instructing Him and the His Spirit as the power.# Zechariah 4:10b But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel a plumb line is an instrument for building.# Zechariah 4:10c these are the eyes of the LORD the seven eyes Revelation 5:6# The running of God’s eyes throughout the whole earth speaks of God’s providential care put forth for the finishing of the Temple. (For the same figure see 2 Ch 16:9.)# Zechariah 4:10d which range to and for throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; God sees everything\u0026hellip;nothing is hidden from Him. Isaiah 40:27, Matthew 6:6, 8, 18# Zechariah 4:10 But these seven\u0026hellip;will see and be glad\u0026hellip; Don’t despise things that appear small! What matters is how the Lord sees it!# The omniscient Lord would be pleased when He saw the building project restarted.# The second temple serves as a type of the humble aspect of Messiah. The second temple was despised for it\u0026rsquo;s humble size, so too the Messiah would appear as a humble servant.# God rejoices in the day when the second temple was completed just like He will be delighted when the restoration of Israel is complete through the work of Messiah. Isaiah 53# Zechariah 4:11 Then I answered and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; The lamp doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to draw Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s attention like the olive trees on each side.# Zechariah 4:12a And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,# Zechariah 4:12b which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:13 So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:14a Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; The answer is given as to the significance of the two trees beside the lampstand.# Anointed ones literally means sons of oil.# Man is often compared to a tree in the Old Testament. Psalm 1:3, 52:8, Jeremiah 17:8, Daniel 4:10# There are many differing opinions as to the identity of these two anointed ones.# Chapters three and four are connected and complementary. The priestly office (Joshua) and the civil office (Zerubbabel) have been dealt with accordingly.# An interesting consideration for the identity of these two anointed ones are the very two men the context refers to; Joshua and Zerubbabel.# Someone has suggested the two witnesses are the two offices (priesthood and civic) expressed in \u0026ldquo;sons of oil\u0026rdquo; to carry out the role.# Can we see this sort of thing anywhere else?# The book of Revelation mentions two witnesses. The identity of these two witnesses also remains a mystery, however applying the same reasoning, Moses (civil power) and Elijah (religious power). Revelation 11:3-4# If these two in Revelation are Moses and Elijah, there are the civil and religious powers represented as with Zerubbabel and Joshua. [21] # The beast (civil power) and the false prophet (religious power) would be an interesting falsification of this union. Revelation 13# The ultimate fulfillment of verse 14 is the Messiah, who is both King and Priest. Zechariah 6:11-13 [22] # Zechariah 4:14b Lord of the whole earth\u0026hellip; Is clearly a reference to Christ. Revelation 11:4# The fulfillment of this is when Messiah will be Lord of the whole earth.# Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll# Chapter 5 deals with God\u0026rsquo;s judgment on Israel while the nations will be judged in chapter 6.# Individual judgment on Israel# Zechariah 5:1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, Zechariah looked up again and saw a two sided scroll swooping down.# It had writing on the one side and writing on the other. Zechariah 5:3# Zechariah 5:2 \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; The scroll was very large and twice as long as it was wide.# The porch in front of the nave of the first temple was twenty cubits by ten cubits. 1 Kings 6:3# The dimensions of the two cherubim were ten cubits high and together totaled 20 cubits wide with their wings spread out. 1 Kings 6:23-27# The vision would teach us that the holiness of the sanctuary of the Lord is the measure of sin and that judgment must begin at the house of God. 1 Peter 4:17-18[23] # Zechariah 5:3a Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; This time the angel interprets the meaning right away. The flying scroll represents a curse. Ezekiel 2:9-3:27, Jeremiah 36, Revelation 5, Isaiah 30:8# Under the Mosaic covenant agreement, the people experienced blessings when they kept it but coursings when they didn\u0026rsquo;t. Deuteronomy 27:15-26, 28:15-68# This curse is not intended for the whole earth but for the whole land of Israel. This is a curse directed specifically at individual people of Israel for not keeping the covenant.# Zechariah 5:3b surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, Malachi 3:6-9, Zechariah 8:17# Just like the law was given to Moses on two tablets, the scroll had two sides. The writing on one side dealt with sins committed against God, while the writing on the other side was regarding sins committed against man. Exodus 32:15-16# The first tablet were commandments dealing with God, while the second tablet was how to treat man.# Stealing would be breaking the middle command on the second tablet.# Zechariah 5:3c and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. Jeremiah 5:2# Swearing falsely by God\u0026rsquo;s name is breaking the middle commandment on one first tablet.# Zechariah 5:4a \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, Malachi 3:5# God himself says he will make the curse go forth. The curse will be totally successful in it\u0026rsquo;s purpose of cutting out the violators of the law.# Zechariah 5:4b \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; The curse will hit the house of those judged by the flying scroll. Proverbs 11:1# The people had turned to dishonest means (lying and swearing) so that they could build their elaborate homes. Haggai 1:3-4, 6, 9# Haggai 2:9 \u0026ldquo;Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high To be delivered from the hand of calamity!# Haggai 2:10 \u0026ldquo;You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself.# Haggai 2:11 \u0026ldquo;Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework.# Zechariah 5:4c *and it will spend the night\u0026hellip;*this phrase could also be translated it shall remain. Some suggest this to be the better interpretation. Psalm 49:12, Exodus 20:5, Proverbs 3:33# Zechariah 5:4d within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo; The curse will go into the house of the ones found guilty by the scroll. Their house would be consumed. Amos 3:15# Those who built their home sanctuaries using dishonest means while ignoring God\u0026rsquo;s house will have no place to hide, the curse will enter their home and consume it. Habakkuk 2:9-11, James 5:2-3# Nothing will be left of their own house for which they have worked so hard, for which they had neglected God’s house. Haggai 1:4# Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket# Verses 5-11 deal with national judgment on Israel in a future time. While the previous sin deals with sinful deeds, this vision deals with sin as a whole or system.# Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; Following the vision of the scroll, Zechariah was encouraged to look up again.# Zechariah 5:6a I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; the ephah was a standard unit of measuring volume. It was associated with a certain container.# The ephah was a dry measure used for measuring barley or wheat. Therefore it is a symbol of commerce or trade. Ezekiel 45:9-11, Amos 8:5, Isaiah 5:10# Zechariah 5:6b-7a Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land# The Berean study Bible renders this verse as their iniquity through all the land.# The ephah as a whole symbolized their iniquity or appearance in the land as a whole.# The implication is that it had become a national problem. This was not just an issue on an individual level. They had become nationally known for using dishonest measures.# Zechariah 5:7b (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; This must be connected to the people who were using dishonest gain but it does not need to be specific since the next verse we are told the ephah represents all the wickedness in the land.# On top of the ephah was placed a heavy cover.# Inside the small barrel was a woman.# It is possible that the lead cover symbolizes ministry of the Holy Spirit in restraining evil. [24] # Zechariah 5:8 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; The identity of the woman in the basket is given as the representation of wickedness.# Wickedness includes Idolatry and all other forms of evil. Ezra 9, Isaiah 57, 65:1-7, 66:17# The woman (wickedness), is contained within the ephah (commerce) with a lead weight (perhaps the restraining of the Holy Spirit).# In Hebrew, the feminine is used to present abstract concepts. Proverbs 2:16 and 5:3-4# Zechariah 5:8 And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. Even with the lid opened for a brief moment, wickedness wanted to get out but she was thrown in by the angel and contained by the lid.# During the church age, the Holy Spirit plays the important role of restraining the man of lawlessness. 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8# After the church age, during the Tribulation period, wickedness will not be held back. She will do as she pleases, wherever she pleases. However a time will come when God will remove wickedness from Israel.# Zechariah 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; two women were needed because of the weight.# Zechariah 5:9 and they had wings like the wings of a stork, A stork is a large bird and common to describe the appearance of the women.# Zechariah 5:9 and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. The ephah was lifted up.# Zechariah 5:10 I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; This time, Zechariah didn\u0026rsquo;t ask who these were or what the ephah was but where they were taking it.# The ephah will be removed from the land of Israel, but where?# Zechariah 5:11 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; Wickedness will be carried away from the land of Israel to Shinar.# The reference in the land of Shinar is to Babylonia. This was the land where man had first united in a universal rebellion against God. Genesis 10:10, 11:2, 11# Genesis 11:2, 4 It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there..They said, \u0026ldquo;Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:11 and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo; Once the temple is prepared, wickedness will have a fixed resting place as an object of worship.# Babylon stands throughout Scripture for confusion in spiritual matters, for idolatry, for spiritual uncleanness. Revelation 17:3-5# Just like in the days of Nimrod, the people will once again unite under a common purpose to make a name for themselves and instead of scattering, they will flock together and build wickedness a house. [25] # The Lord is allowing evil to play its course. Wickedness will have her own temple and be set up to be worshipped. Her power will be great over the people to bring unity in two main areas:# One common, forced religion. Revelation 13:12-15# One governmental, forced commerce. Revelation 13:16-17# The fulfillment of this vision must be future. It cannot be interpreted as referring to the exile to Babylon since they had already returned.# The city of Babylon will be made a perpetual desolation with nothing dwelling in it. This can never be said to have happened to Babylon.# The city of Babylon was never been destroyed in the way God said it would be. [26] # Jeremiah foretold of Babylon\u0026rsquo;s literal future destruction. Jeremiah 50-51 [27] # Jeremiah 51:62 and say, \u0026lsquo;You, O LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.\u0026rsquo;# When Medo-Persia overthrew Babylon, the city was never affected.# Hundreds of years later, Alexander the Great stayed in Babylon. In fact, It is said that Alexander wanted to rebuild the Tower of Babel.# Wickedness will become centralized as she sits on her pedestal in her house in Babylon (Shinar). She will continue her influence on the nations until Babylon is destroyed at the end of the Tribulation. Revelation 17-18# We will see the fulfillment of this in greater detail in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s second burden.# Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots# Zechariah 6:1-8 Judgment on the nations# Zechariah 6:1-3 The vision# Zechariah 6:1a Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth\u0026hellip; Zechariah looks and he sees four chariots coming.# Chariots typically were used in battle. These chariots are going out in a war-like fashion to execute judgment. Psalm 46:9# Chariots often symbolize power and authority. Psalm 20:7, Isaiah 66:15, Habakuk 3:8, Haggai 2:22# Some suggest the 4 chariots symbolize the 4 empires in Daniel. This seems unlikely.# Zechariah 6:1b from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. The chariots came from between two mountains. Psalm 36:6# We are not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. There is no reason to think these mountains are not physical locations since the destination of the chariots are geographical locations, therefore the place of origin must be as well. Zechariah 6:8# It may be that the place of origin of the chariots are mount Zion and mount olives divided by the valley of Jehoshaphat. Zechariah 14:4# The bronze in Scripture is often where God’s judgement deals with sin. Numbers 21:9, John 3, Revelation 1:15# The prophet Joel mentions the valley of Jehoshaphat in relation the judgment of the nations. Joel 3:2, 12# Zechariah 6:2-3 With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses...# earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three colors of horses. The meaning of the horse colors are not explained to us.# Revelation 6 mentions horses of the same colors although they proceed in a different order.# Red - takes peace, men slay one another. Symbolizes war and bloodshed# Black - often symbolizes death and famine# Strong dappled or grizzled - possibly plagues# White - often symbolizes triumph and victory. In Revelation 6 it refers to the Antichrist while in Zechariah it refers to God\u0026rsquo;s agents claiming victory.# There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does equate to identity.# Zechariah 6:4-8 The Interpretation# This vision clearly shows how the Lord almighty is in control over sovereigns. It regards divine judgment on Gentile nations in relation to their poor treatment to Israel. Isaiah 66:15# Zechariah 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wishes to know the identity of the horse pulled chariots.# what are these - this was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s question regarding the vision with the horseman, the 4 horns, and the two olive trees.# One day the same question will be asked regarding the Messiah\u0026rsquo;s wounds between His arms. Zechariah 13:6# Zechariah 6:5 The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, The angel\u0026rsquo;s answer refers to the question Zechariah makes.# The Lord of all the earth - is a term used to describe the Lord as the sovereign of the earth.# When Joshua crosses the Jordan to posess the land. Joshua 3:11, 13# When Israel is made strong and plunders the nations before the Millennium. Micah 4:13# The word spirits (RUACH) can be translated breath, wind, or spirit . There are some who say these are spirits and others who say they are angels.# Do people carry these judgments out or are they angels? Arguments exist for both sides.# Having been in the presence of the Lord (Sovereign) of all the earth, these four winds were His messengers, the executors of His will. Psalm 104:4, Hebrews 1:7# These are four spirits sent out before the Lord. Four spirits (winds) many times refers to divine judicial judgment. Daniel 7:2, Revelation 7:1# Zechariah 6:6a with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, One group of horses goes north. The other group goes south.# Directions in Scripture are in relation to Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem is at the center (naval) of the earth according to God. Ezekiel 38:12, Ezekiel 5:5# Jewish tradition teaches that the center of Israel is Jerusalem. The center of Jerusalem is the Temple which has the holy place as its center which contains the ark in its center and in the center of the ark. [28] # There\u0026rsquo;s a chunk of real estate the world community thinks peace will break out all over the Middle East. It\u0026rsquo;s a dispute of a territory that they call the West Bank. Why is it called the West Bank in the east? When you use the expression West Bank, you\u0026rsquo;re using a Jordanian mindset. [29] # Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemies always attacked from the north or from the south. To the west of Jerusalem is the Mediteranean sea. To the east is an impassable desert.# The black horses go north, the direction from which most of Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemy invaders descended on the Promised Land. Jeremiah 1:14; 4:6; 6:22; Ezekiel 1:4# Babylon would have invaded Israel from the north. South of Israel is Egypt. Ezekiel 39:2# Zechariah 6:6b-7a while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; All the chariot teams seem eager to execute the command.# Egypt lay to Israel\u0026rsquo;s south, and it was another implacable enemy.# Zechariah 6:7b And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth. The context calls for a broader scope than the land of Israel. This is a patrol sent to the whole earth.# The reality is that the Lord of all the earth will execute judgment on all of Israel\u0026rsquo;s enemies.# Zechariah 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The Lord now responds to Zechariah as the vision plays out.# It is possibly that verses 6 and 8 refer to Babylon. If this is the case, this is merely a temporary appeasement of God\u0026rsquo;s wrath against Babylon since Babylon will be reserved for judgment. Zechariah 5:5-11, Revelation 17-18# This would serve as an example of how God will take care of all of Israel’s enemies.# Zechariah 6:8 have appeased My wrath in the land of the north. The black horses and white horses brought judgment upon the land of the north and appeased God\u0026rsquo;s anger.# Since the chariots went in compass directions, we should probably understand their judgment to be universal. Zechariah 2:6; Jeremiah 49:36; Ezekiel 37:9; Revelation 7:1[30] # While we see the wrath of God appeased in the north, we will also see Messiah at one point fighting in the south…# Zechariah 9:14 Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south.# Isaiah 63:1 Who is this who comes from Edom, With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah, This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His strength? \u0026ldquo;It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.\u0026rdquo;# Isaiah 63:2 Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?# Isaiah 63:3 \u0026ldquo;I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I stained all My raiment.# Isaiah 63:4 \u0026ldquo;For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My year of redemption has come.# Isaiah 63:5 \u0026ldquo;I looked, and there was no one to help, And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold; So My own arm brought salvation to Me, And My wrath upheld Me.# Isaiah 63:6 \u0026ldquo;I trod down the peoples in My anger And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.\u0026rdquo;# This final vision presents several difficulties in its details, however the overall message is clear. God will have vengeance on those nations who have mistreated Israel.# Zechariah’s vision assures us that God is in control of the future and will judge the Gentile nations during “the day of the Lord.”# Following the destruction of Israel’s enemies we will see Messiah usher in the 1000 year Kingdom.# Zechariah 6:9-15 The crowning of Joshua the priest# In the vision in chapter three we saw the priestly line being reinstated and in chapter four we saw the royal line represented by Zerubbabel. Zechariah is told to have a crown made and hold a ceremony crowning the priest.# A priest was never to be crowned. A king was never allowed to serve as priest. These two offices were always distinct and separated by God. Only Levites served as priests. Only Judeites could be kings.# This crown symbolically points ahead to Messiah who will serve in the capacity of priest and king. The two offices will unite in Him.# The eight, night visions have ended, but the coronation of Joshua is closely connected with these revelations which extend in scope from Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s day to the full establishment of Israel in blessing.[31] # Zechariah 6:9-10a The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, Zechariah was to receive a gift from a group of exiles who had arrived from Babylon. This is a prophetic word as well. The Lord informs Zechariah of a group of men (by name) and tells him where they have arrived.# We will see this prophecy fulfilled that same day. The fulfilment of the prophecy was consistently literal. It was clearly as God had said it would be, Zechariah did not have to imagine what the prophecy meant to know the primary purpose.# Zechariah 6:10b from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; Zechariah was instructed to receive an offering (not demand it) from these exiles. These men were gracious givers who wanted to contribute towards the temple building. Ezra 1:4, 6# While it was not Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s job to receive offerings for the building project, God sends Zechariah to collect this special offering and will give it a singular purpose.# Zechariah 6:10b and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. God specifically tells Zechariah to go to a specific person\u0026rsquo;s house and meet those men there.# Zechariah 6:11 \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. This calls the attention of the listener. Crown for a priest? This is strange, as you don\u0026rsquo;t crown a priest.# Crown (ATARAH) here is plural. However, in verse 14 crown (ATARAH) it is singular.# This ornate crown was to be made from out of several crowns. Revelation 19:12# Kings were to be from the tribe of Judah while priests could only be from the tribe of Levi. Genesis 49:10# Jesus was from the tribe of Judah. How could He serve as priest? Because his order was of a different, higher one according to Melchizedek. Genesis 14:18, Hebrews 5:10# No king could serve in the office of priest and no priest could serve in the office as king.# Anybody that mixed the two offices of priest and king suffered terrible consequences.# Saul - 1 Samuel 13 relates how king Saul tries to take on priestly duties to help. Though he was told he did it anyway and the consequence for doing it was that his kingdom was taken from him that very day.# King Uzziah entered the temple of God to burn incense on the altar. Burning incense on the altar was something only the priests could do. Instantly, leprosy broke out on his forehead. 2 Chronicles 26:18-20# Jeroboam - as king took on the prerogative to add two other places of worship, at Dan and Bethel. Two things come into play here. He got involved in the office as priest but primarily he played with the lineage of kings, specifically the line of David. 1 Kings 12:26-31, 1 Kings 14:9, 1 Kings 11:32, 1 Kings 11:28-29# Joshua the high priest serves as a type of the Priest that will be crowned as king. To be warranted by God and the two offices joined in one person meant only one thing, this was referring to the Messiah. God\u0026rsquo;s anointed servant, the Priest-King.# Today, Christ is serving in the capacity of priest but is seated behind the veil on the Father\u0026rsquo;s throne.# Christ is not ruling as King.# He has not been crowned yet. John 18:36, Revelation 1:12-18# Matthew 6:10 Pray…thy kingdom come…on earth as it is in heaven…# Jesus will one day change thrones from sitting next to the Father to sitting on His own throne. Revelation 3:21# He will one day return to earth to rule as King of the earth in the Millennial age. Zechariah 14:16-17# Zechariah 6:12a \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, The Branch is a reference to a man’s name, He will be the Messiah. Zechariah 3:8; Isaiah 11:1, 53:2; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:14-18# Prior to Jesus, The Aramaic Targum, the Jerusalem Talmud, and a Midrash all regarded verse 12 as messianic. 32 # Zechariah 6:12b for He will branch out from where He is; After the identity of this Man is established to be Messiah, we now are told what He will do.# This speaks of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s very humble beginning when He comes. Isaiah 53:2, John 19:5# In Zechariah 3:8 The Branch is introduced as the Lord\u0026rsquo;s servant.# It’s a bit of a play on words. The shoot will shoot up from beneath (where there is little promise of life). 33 # He will grow out into a beautiful thing. Isaiah 4:2# Zechariah 6:12c and He will build the temple of the LORD. Messiah, upon his second coming will build the fourth temple which will be during the Millennium. Ezekiel 40-46# Since the first temple was literal, we can assume the fourth temple will also be literal.# The dimensions given for the fourth temple are literal and cannot be understood unless one takes it to be a physical temple with physical measurements.# Zechariah presents this temple as distinct.# Zechariah consistently uses the word BAYIT (31 times) for temple or house throughout the book.# The word for temple here is HEKAL (translated temple, naval or palace). See references where HEKAL is translated palace. 1 Kings 21:1, 2 Kings 20:18, Psalm 45:8, 15, 144:12, Proverbs 30:28, Isaiah 13:22, Isaiah 39:7, Hosea 8:14, Amos 8:3, Nahum 2:6# Zechariah switches to use the word HEKAL only in verses 12, 13, 14, 15 and 8:9 to describe the temple the Branch would build. Haggai 2:18# Zechariah 6:12 …will be built by the Branch…Malachi 3:1,# Zechariah 6:13 …where His throne will be…Ezekiel 44:3# (ii Zechariah 6:14 …where the crown will be displayed as a reminder…# (iv) Zechariah 6:15 …those far off would come to build…# (v) Zechariah 8:9 …the prophets spoke beforehand it will be built…# From the usage of the word HEKAL in verses 12 through 15, Zechariah appears to distinguish the future temple from the second temple being built.# Zechariah 8:9 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house BAYIT of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple HEYKAL might be built.# Ezekiel also describes the Millennial temple using the word HEKAL. It would appear by his usage that the HEKAL is within the BAYIT. Ezekiel 41-42# This temple will not be built until after the Tribulation, at the beginning of the Millennium and will only be standing during that dispensation since Scripture tells us there is no physical temple in the Eternal State. Ezekiel 41:6-7, Revelation 21:22# Clearly this temple is meant to be understood as a physical structure, not spiritual (as some suggest) since the thrust of the Text is to describe with precision how the temple will be.# We are given the temple’s exact measurements of the wall. Ezekiel 40:5# The measurements of the court. Ezekiel 40:47# The measurements of the sanctuary. Ezekiel 41:4# Zechariah 6:13a \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor\u0026hellip;He will build the temple HEKAL and he will bear the honor\u0026hellip;# While Zerubbabel was instrumental in building the second temple, he was did not receive the honor, God did. Zechariah 4:6-7# When Jesus builds the Millennial temple, He will receive all the honor for the building, as well as for who He is, King of all the earth.# Zechariah 6:13b …and sit and rule on His throne. He will build the temple HEKAL and set up His throne in it.# This speaks of two different roles. He sits and He rules. He sits as priest because of His finished redemptive work and rules as king from His throne. Revelation 3:20# The text makes it clear this is not a heavenly throne. In the heavenly throne scenes in the Bible, Messiah is sitting at the right hand of God\u0026rsquo;s throne. Here we see Messiah will sit and rule on His (Messiah’s) thronPsalm 110:1-4# In Revelation 3:21 we see the two thrones, …I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.# Architecturally, temple and throne belong together. The temple is a sacred palace; it houses God\u0026rsquo;s throne. The Lord identifies the eschatological temple as \u0026ldquo;the place of my throne\u0026rdquo;. Ezekiel 43:7[34] # The Branch\u0026rsquo;s kingdom will be widespread. Furthermore, He will build the temple of Yahweh. Zerubbabel, not Joshua, was God\u0026rsquo;s choice to build the restoration temple. (Zechariah 4:9-10) but Messiah, whom Joshua prefigured, would build the future temple for Yahweh. Isaiah 2:2-4; 56:6-7; Ezekiel 40—43; Micah 4:1-7; Haggai 2:6-9[35] # Cleary, Zechariah is telling us Jesus will one day build a particular temple in Jerusalem. It will be fitting for the greatest monarchy the world has ever seen.# He will reign with justice and fairness. Jeremiah 23:5# He will reign with power. Psalm 2# His ministers are glorified church saints. Revelation 20:6# His subjugates will love him with all their heart. Jeremiah 31:33, 32:39# The Shekinah glory will return to this temple. Ezekiel 40-46# Zechariah 6:13c Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; The Priest will not only reign on a throne, but His rule will be categorized by peace between the office of priest and office of king. The king will rule from His throne. This is the Davidic throne promised beforehand. 2 Samuel 7:12-16# Upon the merging of the two offices, Jesus will usher in world peace (shalom).# He brings peace with God judicially.# He brings peace of God in the heart.# He brings physical, world peace.# Zechariah 6:14 \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. This ornate crown of many crowns was to serve as a reminder of the gift of these men.# a reminder could be translated a memorial. Exodus 12:14, Exodus 28:12# To be consistent with Zechariah’s usage of the word temple HEKAL would mean that the crown would one day serve as a reminder in the temple HEKAL (Millennial temple) to those who graciously donated for the making of it.# These men graciously gave by faith as unto the Lord.# They had to trust God because Zechariah would use it for a crown rather than towards financing the building.# They had to God that one day a Priest would wear a crown. This made no sense at the time.# Their names remain recorded in Scripture but the ultimate fulfillment of this will be when those in the Millennium will be reminded of the importance of the foundational work done in building Zerubbabel’s temple.# The rebuilding of the second temple may seem somewhat insignificant today, but to God it was very important, and that will be reflected one day in the future temple.# It also points to a greater fulfillment in the very Man, the Branch, who the crown is made for, the Priest-King, Messiah.# The temple was never to be worshipped. The creator is to be worshipped. Colossians 1:16-17# Zechariah 6:15a \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 31:10# Those who are far off may be referring to the scattered people of Israel who will come to build the Millennial temple.# Isaiah also speaks of the coming of gentile nations to the temple in Jerusalem during the Millennium: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it”. Isaiah 2:2, 56:6-7 1# In the Millennium, when the Kingdom is being built, the first thing people will do is come together to Jerusalem and build the temple. Zechariah 2:11, 8:22, Isaiah 2:2-4; 56:6-7; 60:1-7# The Church however is commanded to go into all the world to build His Church. Matthew 28:19-20# Zechariah 6:15b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Notice how important it is to God that they should know these things. God, in all his greatness and incomprehensible glory, reveals Himself to man in perceivable, palpable ways.# Zechariah 6:15c And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. Acts 2:39# The taking place of these things (the memorial crown serving as a reminder in the future temple) would only take place if Zechariah and the Jewish remnant kept the covenant. We know this condition will not be kept until the time of the end when Israel is saved.# The statement “if you completely obey the Lord your God” reminds us of Deuteronomy 28.# Deuteronomy 28:1 \u0026ldquo;Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the LORD your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.# Deuteronomy 28:2 \u0026ldquo;All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you obey the LORD your God:# IV. Zechariah 7-8 - The Third Message: Four Admonitions# A. Zechariah 7:1-14 A misunderstanding of “return to me”# After the 8 visions, Zechariah now continues the theme of the book, returning to the Lord. 14 months have passed since Zechariah preached his first message to return to Him. Haggai 2:12-16# As it happens, the people decided to take up national fasts to remember the first temple, the destruction of Jerusalem and other important events.# They had been faithfully mourning for 70 years and the town of Bethel sent a group of people to Jerusalem to ask the priests how much longer they should continue their fasts.# The people, especially the older generation, missed Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple, the glory days of Jerusalem and the way things used to me.# Their theological understanding of returning is about returning to when things were better. They were mistaken to focus on the historical blessings instead of the giver of the blessings. Their trust was focused on returning to those \u0026ldquo;glory\u0026rdquo; days. Jeremiah 7:4# Their reason for seeking God was that His blessings would return, not because they were desirous to return to Him.# The next two chapters deals with clarifying this misunderstanding.# First, God will show them the error of their thinking. Then, He will show them where (or who) their faith should be placed on.# Zechariah 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. 14 months had passed between Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s first message and this third one.# Zechariah 7:2 Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, In response to Zechariah’s message, the concerned town of Bethel sent a delegation to seek the favor of the Lord.# Bethel means house of God, probably about 12 miles north of Jerusalem.# At the time of writing, Bethel was part of Judah, not Samaria. Ezra 2:28# Regemelech and Sharezer are Assyrian names.# Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king\u0026rsquo;s spokesman. If this is the same man, perhaps he had some governmental authority.# We don\u0026rsquo;t see Regemmelech mentioned again in Scripture. However a man named Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father, the Assyrian king Sennacherib, and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38# Esarhaddon began to reign in place of his father, Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37# Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, \u0026ldquo;Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.\u0026rdquo; Ezra 4:2# Were these men Regemmelech and Sharezer and their men sent to merely \u0026ldquo;appease\u0026rdquo; God?# Bethel had a long history of syncretistic faith. It was at Bethel that Jeconiah set up a calf to be worshipped so that the people would not go down to Jerusalem to worship.# Zechariah 7:3a speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain,# Perhaps these men were very sincere in their belief that their abstaining of food and weeping was pleasing to God.# Zechariah 7:3b as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; This was something they had practiced over and over every year, every time the date come up.# The second temple was destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus the Roman. It was destroyed on the 9th day of the 5th month which is the same day Nebuchadnezzar burned down the first temple in 586b.C.# Today the Jews commemorate this day with fasting and morning. Instead of returning to the Lord, the religious Jews want God to give them a temple so as to return their religious activities. No wonder God does not answer this prayer.# Word of the Lord #1 - Addressing a wrong concept of repentance# Zechariah 7:4-5 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; Zechariah as priest and prophet receives the word of the Lord telling him communicate it to the people, including the priests.# Evidently everyone needed to hear the following admonition from the Lord.# Zechariah 7:4-5 When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years\u0026hellip; for 7 decades they had religiously carried out these fasts.# They fasted and mourned four major events# The fast of the fifth month was remembering when Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple was burned by Nebuchadnezzar in 586b.C. 2 Kings 25:8# The fast of the seventh month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to flee to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25# Fasts were also held in the fourth and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2# These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They were self-imposed by the people and held throughout the years of Babylonian captivity.# The question being brought before the prophets and priests seems sincere. God\u0026rsquo;s answer will reveal they have a problem.# Perhaps many grew up practicing these ceremonies and presumed they should just continue. Many traditions are carried on by future generations without ever questioning.# Through this series of 4 messages, God will show them the crisis in their thinking in order to pleade with this generation of post-exile jews to change their thinking and return to Him by faith.# Zechariah 7:5b \u0026hellip;was it actually for Me that you fasted? They answer they receive is a question. The Lord Jesus often used this technique to make people think.# The question was not:# Who started the fast? Perhaps some important person began this and carried down the ranks. That would make the fast important.# When were they started? The circumstances they were started under would reflect their great suffering.# How many people attend? To know that everybody practiced them would confirm the authenticity.# Where do you fast? Perhaps, once the temple was built, they would be able to carry on in the temple courts?# Instead, the question asked was regarding the authenticity of it. For what reason did you fast? God’s question is, did you do it for me?# It seemed to them, that maybe God was questioning their sincerity. Perhaps He didn’t realize all that went into prohibitions and weeping for endless hours. It was hard work, only the truest Jews would carry them out all the way.# Perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting to commemorate the loss of the temple among others. Nobody bothered to ask, “what does God say about it?”# Certainly, the ritualistic weeping had an appearance of spirituality. Surely God would be impressed and be moved to show mercy? Isaiah 39:13# In the minds of the people, especially the younger generation, it was a practice they had always done. They grew up doing it. It was normal to do it. Perhaps if the question was, \u0026ldquo;why do you fast?\u0026rdquo;, the answer would have been, \u0026ldquo;because we\u0026rsquo;ve always done so\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;.# God goes beyond the “why” question and moves to make them question something deeper, did you consider Me when doing it? Was it me you were after? Was I the intent of your heart?# They were missing the point by asking if they should continue or not. They evidently presumed that what they did was right. Somehow, they appear to think that their fasting almost caused their return to the land. Now that God has favored them, should they continue?# Maybe if they were to go on, they would get an extra added blessing?# God makes them question, why had they done it in the first place? Isaiah 58:3-8# Motivation for these particular fastings were not for God. Neither did God ever tell them they should be done.# The prophet Jeremiah\u0026rsquo;s conclusion as he lamented the destruction of Jerusalem is contrasted their mourning. Though he was incredibly sad, his hope was in the Lord not on better days. Lamentations 5:21, 3:21-23# Today, Christians do things out of habit or even worse, because of habit in the name of God, thinking they must be done because they have been practiced for decades. Perhaps we should ask ourselves why we do what we do. Is it really out of gratitude for God that we do it or are we seeking something in return?# forgetting the reality behind the ritual is hanging on to an empty ritual. There is a mighty power in tradition to blind people from reality. Mark 7:13# One day in the future, all of Israel will weep, not for loosing out on some blessings or as a means to commemorate better days, but the day they realize it was them that had pierced their own Deliverer and Messiah. Zechariah 12:10-14# This is the day the nation of Israel will repent (change their minds) and place their faith in Jesus the Messiah to receive the forgiveness of sins through His finished work on the cross. Oh what a blessed day that will be! A glad reunion between a nation and their God.# Zechariah’s first message was to return to the Lord, not return to remember better days or return to hope for times of prosperity.# True, Biblical Repentance# One of the greatest misunderstandings of the Bible today centers around the understanding of what repentance is. In order to inspire what they consider to be repentance, many are teaching a Gospel of works. \u0026ldquo;Clean up your life and you will be saved\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;have you truly mourned for your sin?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;turn from your sin and be saved\u0026rdquo;.# What was needed for Israel to be restored? To return to God. A simple turning from what they were trusting in (idolatry) to once again trust God.# God is richly revealing His goodness, forbearance and long-suffering to lead people turn to Him. That is, to change their minds from what they are believing to believing in Him. Romans 2:4# Some teachings of \u0026ldquo;grace\u0026rdquo; essentially promote a sense of rebellion against the law of God. Grace is not contrary to the law, it is contrary to legalism. These false understandings end up promoting the believer with a license to sin.# Legalism seeks to find God\u0026rsquo;s favour either for justification or sanctification by means of law keeping. It is possible to see the Christian life as keeping with external morality, however God would question us, did you do it for Me?# Grace teaches us Christ as the means to walk with God. Grace gives us the correct motivation of a thankful heart.# In Christ the believer upholds and agrees with the law in, never rebelling against it.# On the contrary, God is never in favour of legalism. Legalism springs from self-righteousness and a complete misunderstanding of God\u0026rsquo;s perfect righteousness and man\u0026rsquo;s depravity.# The Christian is never encouraged to walk independent of God. Quite the opposite, God works all things together towards his/her utlimate good, for a life in total dependancy upon God. Isaiah 66:2, John 15:5, 19, Romans 8:32-33, Psalm 40:16-17# Matthew 6:16 \u0026ldquo;Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.# Matthew 6:17 \u0026ldquo;But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face# Matthew 6:18 so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.# Their theological understanding of what repentance meant needed to be challenged. They were more upset about the effects than the cause. To them, a return meant mourning over the evil that resulted in order to make the good return.# Their concept of returning to God was an issue of how they were affected not what God said. The very reason they were taken out of the land was not a series of mishaps but because God had said their total disregard for Him would lead to their demise.# Isaiah 30:15 For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said, \u0026ldquo;In repentance and rest you shall be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength.\u0026rdquo; But you were not willing,# Zechariah 7:6 \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? In a similar fashion to their fasting (ceasing from any food), eating and drinking is done without considering God but for mere physical supplement. We do it for self-preservation or personal enjoyment.# Whether we eat or don\u0026rsquo;t eat makes little difference before God if our relationship with Him is estranged. They were not closer or farther to God by eating for themselves.# Zechariah 7:7 \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is not a new message they had never heard before.# God says through Zechariah, I’m saying now what I said through prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos to the previous generations. This generation was on their way to repeating exactly same thing. The circumstances might be a little different but the message is exactly the same because their thinking was exactly the same.# The reason they were sent into exile in the first place, the reason the glorious days were over, was their own fault for not trusting the Lord. God had said through the prophets that it would happen if they did not listen.# Amos 4:6 \u0026ldquo;But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# Amos 4:7 \u0026ldquo;Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up.# Amos 4:8 \u0026ldquo;So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# Amos 4:9 \u0026ldquo;I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# Amos 4:10 \u0026ldquo;I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# Amos 4:11 \u0026ldquo;I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; Yet you have not returned to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# The question demonstrates the way the people thought. They lamented over the consequences for decades but had not considered even for a moment that it was their disobedience to the covenant that caused them in the first place.# It did not seem to enter their minds that the real crisis was that they were estranged with God. This really didn\u0026rsquo;t bother them. What bothered them is keeping the memory alive.# Their thinking dictated that if they would felt sorry enough, sad enough, if they truly lamented their condition, God would see them in their lamentable state and feel pity.# This is an example of a self-righteous approach and comes from a faulty understanding of God\u0026rsquo;s absolute righteousness. The only way to approach God is God\u0026rsquo;s way through God\u0026rsquo;s provision.# Just like the fasting in those days was not for God, today\u0026rsquo;s Christian activities can be godless while having a certain spiritual look appeal to them. Colossians 2:20-23# Word of the Lord #2 - Showing the cause; failure to walk by faith# Zechariah 7:8-9 *Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,* \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; God takes the nation back to a right perspective according to the covenant, not according to their own ideas.# They had willingly entered this covenant with God.# If Israel kept the law, God said He would bless them. However, when Israel did not hold to their part of the covenant, God was obligated to curse them.# God did not exile them for not being perfect but rather for their failure to turn to Him because of their failure to keep the covenant.# Failure to listen means they were so intent on keeping the law they failed to be instructed on how God meant them to carry it out. The law was really meant to show them inadequacy so they would look to Him as they failed.# This verse is not teaching in favour of modern day \u0026ldquo;social justice\u0026rdquo;. The law was in place to protect the oppressed, not to force \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; on everyone.# By putting things in perspective of the Mosaic law, the idea is that they would realize their error.# Were they dispensing fairness?# Were they showing brotherly kindness and compassion?# The 10 Commandments numbers 1 through 4 related to God, while commandments 6 through 10 related to man.# Administration of justice was to be according to truth.# 16. Zechariah 7:10a and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; James, the epistle written to Jews says, these are the marks of true religion. James 1:27# Morning lost benefits caused by ones own sin is just empty ritualism, not true religion.# Instead, they had been neglecting and oppressing the most vulnerable in the nation.# A stranger (GER) was a legal, non-jew living in the land. Ruth the Moabite, was an example of a stranger in the land.# 17. Zechariah 7:10b and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; Their hearts were against one another therefore they devised evil. They tried to take advantage of each other for personal profit. Proverbs 4:23# 18. Zechariah 7:11 \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. This served as an instruction to this generation. Refusing to listen to God comes at inevitable consequences.# Two examples are given to illustrate their refusal to listen# Turned a stubborn shoulder – This is likened to a stubborn ox who refuses the yoke. Nehemiah 9:29# Still the messengers of the Lord pleaded with them.# Stopped their ears from hearing –like a child plugs his ears so as not to hear. Deuteronomy 8:20, Isaiah 33:15, Isaiah 6:10, Jeremiah 7:26# Their indifference to God\u0026rsquo;s word is what caused the 70-year exile.# 19. Zechariah 7:12a \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts…# Flint is a very hard stone used for cutting and piercing things. A heart like flint is one like an adamant stone, hard and cannot receive God\u0026rsquo;s word. Matthew 13:3-9# These people hardened their hearts, and they became deaf to God’s word. They could no longer hear out of choice, not because God removed the ability to hear.# This might be difficult for you to image could happen to you but given time and a constant indifference to the conscience and to the voice of the Spirit, one becomes cold, indifferent and far, one gets to the point He cannot hear God’s word. Jeremiah 22:21# 20. Zechariah 7:12a …had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; Acts 6:8-15# Zechariah is the first to record this doctrine of the Spirit. It was the Spirit that prompted the prophets to speak.# The Lord of hosts words were sent by The Spirit of God. The Jew considered the person of the Spirit precious, yet they refused to listen to Him through the people He sent. Acts 7:51-53# They found themselves in opposition against the Law and the word of God.# When Stephen reminded the first century Jews about this, and they stoned him. Acts 7:54-60# For such continued disobedience, there could be but one result, and this was great wrath from the Lord. The greatness of the wrath can be seen in the great punishment inflicted. 2 Chronicles 36:1612 # Zechariah 7:12b-13 therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. They did not keep the covenant, so in keeping with the agreement, the wrath of God came. Did they return to God when they realized this? Unfortunately, no.# For over 1000 years the Scriptures had been warning them of this. Deuteronomy 28:49-50# It is easy to misunderstand God\u0026rsquo;s wrath is brought on due to His relationship being cut off with His people. It is a faith issue, not perfection issue.# The sacrificial system was set up for this reason.# When God\u0026rsquo;s people don\u0026rsquo;t walk as they should, that is, trusting in Him, in His ways, listening to what He has to say, then God will turn to other methods to capture the attention of His people.# The good news is that for the believer in the Church age, we no longer fear the wrath of God, yet that does not mean He will not discipline those he loves. Hebrews 11:5# Zechariah 7:12b-13 \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; God reverses the situation. For countless times God had been calling out to them, now they get to see what it\u0026rsquo;s like when God doesn\u0026rsquo;t listen. Isaiah 28:12, Proverbs 28:9, Isaiah 1:15# When a relationship is cut off, communication is cut off as a result.# When communication is cut off, the relationship is cut off.# While the people seemed to be fine without God, they ignored him. When troubles came however, they called out to God for help and in turn, God did not listen to them.# Would they miss the point of God\u0026rsquo;s not answering their call?# This does not mean God was playing \u0026ldquo;the silent game”.# Did they call out to God because they realized they needed Him or because they wanted to be delivered of the situation? Micah 3:4# Had God had helped them get what they desired; would it have helped the relationship? James 4:3# Zechariah 7:14a \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. God\u0026rsquo;s ways are perfect. He wanted their ultimate good. Since they were not in a condition to listen, He sent them into different directions where they were no longer together in the land.# Perhaps then they would seek his face?# Since they wanted to be like the rest of the nations, God does exactly that. He scatters them to the nations. 1 Samuel 8:5# So much of Israel\u0026rsquo;s custom revolved around the land, Jerusalem and the temple. These were given to them by God to serve as reminders of who He was. Yet now, in a strange land they had nothing except God Himself.# Would they turn to God to trust Him? Or mourn for the loss of these things?# Storm Wind… it was as though a windstorm had blown them off the Promised Land. Deuteronomy 28:36-37, 64-68; Hosea 13:3# Zechariah 7:14b Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo; Deuteronomy 28:41- 42, 45-52# The pleasant land turned into desolation was due to the sin of the people. Psalm 106:24; Jeremiah 3:19; Daniel 11:16, 41# The land was made to rest. Rest from Israel\u0026rsquo;s abuse to it but mostly, God removed them away from the land so by being alone in a strange land they might turn to God in faith.# The point being made is clear. The reason they were exiled, the reason Jerusalem and the temple was destroyed was due to their incapacity to keep the covenant, not because they had not kept a certain self-appointed fast.# It\u0026rsquo;s good that the priests had to be receiving this message too. They were a major part of the problem and their teaching needed to encourage a return to the Lord.# In light of this, their question seems so very insignificant, and it should encourage these men from Bethel and anyone else to repent (change their minds) and return to the Lord.# It may seem that Zechariah has gone on a rabbit trail and forgot the question that was asked. On the contrary, God is using the prophet to repeat what He had been saying all along, their condition is not new but even more, God had been explaining the crux of the problem.# In essence, outward form of religious activity alone was lifeless unless it was accompanied by a heart of worship directed to God.# Zechariah 8:1-23 - 7 promises concerning Jerusalem. The Faith perspective# Word of the Lord #3 – 7 promises concerning Jerusalem# Almost half of the occurrences of the Lord of hosts occur in chapter 8 when He makes over 8 promises regarding the future He has prepared for Jerusalem.# Promise #1, The Lord will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem# Zechariah 8:1-2 Then the word of the LORD of hosts came*, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo;* Zechariah 1:14-16# Zion can have different nuances in Scripture# Zion is used many times interchangeably with Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 5:7, Isaiah 40:9, Psalm 87:2-3# Zion can also refer to the people of Israel. Isaiah 60:14, Isaiah 52:1# Hebrews used Zion in a figurative sense to speak of the New Jerusalem. Hebrews 12:22# Zion can mean the holy mountain upon which Christ will reign from. Psalm 2:6, Psalm 132:13# In this context, Zion appears to refer to the God’s people, Israel. Zechariah 1:14# Zechariah 8:3a \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the only city that God says He will make his holy habitation.# This will come about during the Millennial Kingdom when Israel is a believing nation.# Promise #2, Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth# Zechariah 8:3b Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,… when God will come to dwell among the people, people will call Jerusalem the City of Truth.# Promise #3 The mountain of Jerusalem will be called Holy Mountain# Zechariah 8:3c and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; Jerusalem is referred to as Sodom in Egypt during the Tribulation. Revelation 11:8# Jerusalem today is a place of conflict. The temple mount is divided.# There’s no reason to say the Mountain is Holy, rather just a place for religious Jews to wail at the temple base, crying for a return of the temple.# Sounds like not much has changed from Zechariah’s generation.# However, when Messiah dwells in her midst Jerusalem will stand for all that is right and truZion will be called a Holy Mountain.# Promise #4, Jerusalem will have complete peace and safety# Zechariah 8:4-5 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; The elderly and the young (the most vulnerable people groups) will be safe and will not be afraid.# Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem to the ground leaving the young and the old lying on the ground. The older generation would remember seeing this. God says he will turn it around. Lamentations 2:21# Promise #5, The Jews will be regathered from around the world to Jerusalem# Zechariah 8:6 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.# When God announces restoration, it may seem improbable but that is what is going to happen. Genesis 18:14# Zechariah 8:7-8b \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west;# Obviously east and west implies more than just Babylon. This is a worldwide return.# Zechariah 8:8b and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; initially this is only a physical return. This sets the stage for discipline during the Tribulation. 2 Peter 3:10# Zechariah 8:8c and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; This refers to more than just a physical return; this is when Israel will return to the Lord! Isaiah 66:8, Zechariah 12:10# This sets the stage for the blessings of the Millennial Kingdom.# Under the Mosaic covenant, Israel would be God\u0026rsquo;s special people among the nations if they kept their part. That is, they would be a nation who reflected God and God would bless them before the Gentile nations.# Therefore, while the Jews are in exile, they are not God\u0026rsquo;s nation. They do not reflect God as a nation, nor do we see God blessing them in the land of promise.# This in no way affects the Abrahamic covenant given 600 years prior that declared them as a nation to be God\u0026rsquo;s possession. This was an unconditional covenant and promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants.# So even though the Jews are in exile, they are still his people and His promises to them still hold true.# Exodus 19:5 \u0026lsquo;Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine.# Though Israel had not walked with God, there would be a time when Israel could be counted as the people of God among the nations if they kept the covenant conditions. This will come about because God will give them a new heart and the Spirit of God will dwell in them to empower them to walk as they should.# Zechariah 8:9 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, in light of these precious promises, God invites Zechariah’s generation to strengthen their hands to the work of the temple rebuilding.# Zechariah 8:9 you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. pay attention to the prophets who told you to get busy rebuilding the temple.# Two of these were Zechariah and Haggai. Zechariah 2:12, Ezra 5:1, 6:14# Zechariah 8:10 \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. There were political, economic problems. Haggai 1:3-6# They worked hard and had nothing to show for it. God had caused the political and economic problems.# Zechariah 8:11 \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts.# God has changed his disposition. The invitation is one to confidently approach God to find mercy and grace.# Promise #6, The land will be a blessing and yield fruit# Zechariah 8:12a \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; Deuteronomy 28:1-14 Quoting by way of blessing if they went back to the Mosaic covenant. Matthew 6:33# Israel had experienced times of cursing in the land, times of discipline away from the land. This speaks of a time of great blessing in the land.# Zechariah 8:12b and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.# Notice how God is actively making this to come about. Believing Israel \u0026ldquo;the remnant\u0026rdquo; will have as an inheritance all of these things. Not by their doing or by their sacrifice but because God causes it to come to pass for those who believe in Him.# In other words, God is saying that when they were focused on their homes, economy, politics, etc. God made it harder for them.# However, now as they focus on the temple, God would supply all their needs in abundance. Matthew 6:33# Promise #7, Israel will become a blessing to the nations# Zechariah 8:13a \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing…# Zechariah 8:13b …Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; Do not fear, trust me!# Fear not appears 365 times in the Bible and twice within these 8 promises. Zechariah 8:15# How do you stop being afraid? Trust God\u0026rsquo;s promises. Zechariah 8:14-15# Again, he says, let you hand be strong. In other words, trust me, let Me make your hands strong! James 5:8, Philippians 4:13, Ephesians 3:16, Colossians 1:11# In just the same measure that Israel has been a stigma among the Gentile nations, God will turn it around. He will reunite the houses (people) of Judah and Israel. They will be one nation under God. He will deliver them and they will no longer be a curse but a blessing to the other nations.# God told them this so that they would take courage. They could find strength in this future promise.# Zechariah 8:14-15 \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, God purposed to bring harm against His people. Why? Because God relentlessly held them to the covenant they had entered with God. God never quit upholding His part.# God disciplines those He loves. He is relentless because he loves His people. Hebrews 12:5# Zechariah 8:15b so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! With that same relentless passion, God says he has purposed to do good to the city of Jerusalem and His people. Malachi 3:8-11, Jeremiah 29:11# Just like there were clauses regarding cursing in the covenant, there were clauses regarding obedience that resulted in blessings. Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 26# Once again, he reiterates, do not fear. God says, \u0026ldquo;when you trust me, you have nothing to fear!\u0026rdquo; Proverbs 28:1,# In a similar sense, for the church age, we have nothing to fear when we trust God! 2 Timothy 1:7# How then should you live? Based on those marvelous promises and what lies ahead for you, God says, you should keep the covenant.# Zechariah 8:16 \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment# Because of who they were, because of their association with God as a people, the natural course of action should be to reflect God in their dealings with one another.# As a community, they should be truth tellers within the assembly of the believing.# They were to be people of judgment. They should make judgments according to truth. Deuteronomy 13:1-5,# We aren\u0026rsquo;t to judge regarding people\u0026rsquo;s motives. And we aren\u0026rsquo;t to judge hypocritically. Matthew 7:1-6# Zechariah 8:16b for peace in your gates. They were to be people who promote peace. Primarily with each other.# Zechariah 8:17 \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, Zechariah 7:10# Heart sins: These are sins committed in the heart.# beware! private thoughts will eventually lead to public actions. Proverbs 4:23# 500 years before Jesus, Zechariah was instructing against heart sins. Matthew 5-7# Zechariah 8:17 and do not love perjury;\u0026rdquo; Loving to lie is something the Lord detests. False weights are an example of what this is talking about. Jeremiah 5:30-31# The treatment they had for each other was reflective of who they had as God. Love for one another and being honest were two key points in the Mosaic covenant.# Swearing by God\u0026rsquo;s name and lying were probably strategies of business learned from their time in Babylon. They went from farming to commerce.# They learned to take advantage of their neighbor (telling them untruths) and used God (using God\u0026rsquo;s name in vain) to legitimize business. Matthew 5:33-37# These two sum up the two aspects of the law. 4 laws were regarding their relationship with God and 6 dealt with their interaction with fellow man.# This did not reflect God\u0026rsquo;s ways established for Israel.# Regarding false prophets, though they are more at fault, it does not mean the people were innocent. The people wanted to hear things they liked. If the people would judge according to truth, false teaching would dry up.# In a similar way today, there would be no business for false teachers if the people of God would judge according to truth.# Zechariah 8:17 for all these are what I hate, declares the LORD. God is a God who loves, but He says there are things He hates.# Haughty eyes,# lying tongue (perjury),# hands that shed innocent blood,# a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness (perjury),# one who spreads strife among the brothers (seek peace).# Jesus also is quoted saying he hates the sin of the Nicolaitans. This was something that a group of people were teaching. Possibly a teaching that promoted laity-clergy distinction. Revelation 2:6# Word of the Lord #4 – Morning into joy, the nations will seek the favor of the Lord# Zechariah now ends this 4 part admonition showing the incredible blessings these men had as Jews because they had wonderful and amazing promises given to them from the Lord of Hosts.# One day the nations will come and desire what the Jews have# They will see the joy in Jerusalem and come to seek the favor of the Lord!# God will turn their mourning into gladness# Zechariah 8:18-19a *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,* \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months\u0026hellip;Four fasts were held every year commemorating the byproduct of their sin. Would those seekers from Bethel realize this?# Religion thrives on ceremony. The greater the number of rituals, the higher the religion.# Religion must of needs highlight the problem but only the God of the Bible provides full and complete restitution by grace.# Zechariah 8:19b \u0026hellip;will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; The pharisees walked around with sad faces because that was the image of spirituality.# While mourning results from man’s work, overflowing joy comes from God’s work.# True spirituality is God\u0026rsquo;s complete provision in Christ. One response is characteristic to Him who experiences the spirituality that comes from Christ - turns mourning into joy, gladness and cheerful feasting! Psalm 30:11# Israel will one day experience this with God, when by faith they return to Him. Zephaniah 3:14-20# Zechariah 8:19b so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; Rather than focusing on mourning their losses, they should focus on loving truth and peace because they had a God who spoke truth and was the God of peace.# The nations of the world seek peace. Yet it is at the cost of truth. Unless there is true justice, truth divides, therefore the nations of the world are willing to do away with truth to establish \u0026ldquo;world unity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;peace\u0026rdquo;.# Zechariah 8:20 Thus says the LORD of hosts,\u0026rsquo; It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. As a result, the Gentiles will come pouring in.# This prophesies a crowd coming from cities will come. Honor and popularity will be returned to Jerusalem as the capital. There will be unity among the people. Israel and Judah will be united as one nation. The cities speaks of the cities of Israel.# Zechariah 8:21 \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; We get the sense of urgency and priority people have, \u0026ldquo;let us go at once\u0026rdquo; to seek the favor of the Lord.# This is how the conversation had begun\u0026hellip;the men from Bethel were seeking the favor of the Lord.# Zechariah 8:22 \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; The people of many nations come to Jerusalem. The fulfilment of this will be when Jesus is reigning in the city of Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:16-18# Why do people come to go to Jerusalem? Because that is where Jesus is.# The Jerusalem will be blessing to the Gentiles# Zechariah 8:23 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; This is Israel being God\u0026rsquo;s people and God being their God.# In the kingdom, 10 gentiles will grab the garment of one jew to ask him to take them to Jerusalem to seek the Lord.# The center of the world will be Jerusalem because Jesus will be there. Isaiah 49:22-23, Deuteronomy 28:13# God\u0026rsquo;s blessing upon the Jews will be undeniable. People of all nations will recognize the God of the Jews and seek to find favor with Him through the access available to the Jew.# This was God\u0026rsquo;s purpose with the nation of Israel from the beginning. They were to be a light unto the Gentiles. They were to be a vessel of pointing the way to God.# Interestingly, after Satan is released from the abyss after 1000 years, he immediately attacks Jerusalem. Revelation 20:9# These future promises were to encourage the returnees in the present.# For the believer today, the Church also has many wonderful promises for the future which are to impress on us in the present. They are separate and unique for the Church.# Is it not wonderful that the promises God made to Israel remain intact and one day will come to fruition just like He said it would?# Christian, does that not affirm the promises God’s word has stated for you?# Zechariah 9:1-14:21 - The Fourth Message: The Two Burdens# Zechariah 9:1-14:21 The Two Burdens of the Lord# The following 5 chapters were probably written later in Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s ministry.# Many skeptics have tried to discredit the authenticity of chapters 9-14 saying it is not the same author as the first 8 chapters. However, these arguments are untenable and can be refuted.# One argument is the difference in style. However, style of writing is not a conclusive argument for different authorship because it can change under different circumstances.# What is different? One difference is the temple is now standing. We know this because Zechariah acts out several charades in the temple.# Chapters 9-11 have to do with foretelling how Messiah will come and offer them a return to Yahweh and to set up His kingdom.# Matthew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach and say, \u0026ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah foretells they will not only reject Messiah’s offer, but they will also pierce Him.# Chapters 9 and 10 explain prophetically the time period when Israel was subjugated under Greece.# Chapter 11 foretells when she is under Roman domination.# Israel rejected this offer but out of that rejection God will create a new administration inclusive of the Gentiles.# During this time, God will not work around one nation but through a new assembly, an organism composed of Jews and Gentiles known as The Church of Jesus Christ. Romans 9:25-29# God temporarily changed his focus from building a nation to building a spiritual gathering because of Israel\u0026rsquo;s persistent unbelief. Romans 9:30-33# The Jews that believe during the timeframe of the Church are included in the Church. Sadly, by and large Jews continue rejecting to return to the Lord.# Chapters 12-14 have to do with foretelling how God will not postpone the promised blessings due to Israel\u0026rsquo;s return to the Lord.# Zechariah 9:1-11:17 The First Burden# Zechariah 9:1-17 The Poem of the King# Zechariah 9:1-8 Setting the scene for the arrival of the King# Zechariah 9:1-7 God, as Sovereign uses a vassal Macedonian king, Alexander to bring Judgement of the oppressive nations surrounding Israel, preparing the way for God\u0026rsquo;s Messiah.# Zechariah 9:1a The burden of the word of the LORD…# Generally speaking, a burden is something God puts on somebody\u0026rsquo;s heart. 1 Corinthians 9:16, Jeremiah 20:9# The word burden (MASSA) in connection to prophecy should be understood as a catastrophic judgment imposed on the prophet to be discharged with a sense of urgency. Zechariah 12:1, Malachi 1:1, Isaiah 13:1# Zechariah 9:1b is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place\u0026hellip; The city of Hadrach no longer exists but has been It has been identified as Hattarika, a city in Syria mentioned several times in the cuneiform inscriptions.# Damascus was the capital city of Syria.# After the battle of Issus in 333b.C., Alexander the Great was quickly moving south towards Egypt. He went conquering from north to south beginning in Syria, then Phoenicia, Philistia and then to Egypt.# Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of Syria.# Tyrus and Sidon are principal cities of Phoenicia# Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of Philistia.# After the attack, Syria never regained native rule.# Zechariah 9:1 (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD). This would mean all the people were watching what God was doing through His instrument, Alexander.# This verse could also be translated \u0026ldquo;for the Lord has his eyes upon men and upon the tribes of Israel\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Zechariah 1:8# The Lord sees all and considers everything and executes judgment and blessing accordingly. Proverbs 15:3# Verse 8 says…For now I have seen with My eyes.# Zechariah 9:2a And Hamath also, which borders on it; Amos 6:2, 2 Kings 25:18-21# Hamath is the third city of Syria that is mentioned.# It was in the land of Hamath that the captain of Nebuchadnezzar’s guard, had many officers of Judah killed. 2 Kings 25:18-21# Zechariah 9:2b Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. Next, Alexander moved to cities in the land of Lebanon. Ezekiel 28:12-17# Though Tyre and Sidon are wise, they cannot escape God’s judgment.# These cities were wise in their own eyes. Ezekiel 28:3-5, Proverbs 3:7# Zechariah 9:3 For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Their trust was in economic power. Their wealth was piled up. James 5:3# Tyre had built a fortress to protect its wealth. Her trust (built herself) is in piled up riches. Joshua 19:29# Tyre was an important commercial city with a great port that was thought to be impossible to conquer. Isaiah 23# Tyre was built on an island and highly fortified. It had a surrounding wall of 150 (46 meters) high. [36] # The Assyrians laid siege against Tyre for 5 years but never conquered the city.# Nebuchadnezzar tried to conquer Tyre for 13 years. Isaiah 23:4, Ezekiel 29:18# Zechariah 9:4 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. We are reminded it is the Lord who is behind Alexander. Tyre and her wealth will be plundered.# This is not an ominous prophecy. Years in advance, Zechariah foretells that Tyre will fall. Her wealth will be thrown into the sea, and she will be burned. Others predicted this as well. Amos 1:9-10, Isaiah 23, Ezekiel 26# Within 7 months, Alexander took the city of Tyre and burned it to the ground. Ezekiel 26:4-12, 27:27# The nations saw this and feared. Ezekiel 27# Zechariah 9:5-7 - Philistia es conquered# Zechariah 9:5a Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Ashkelon sees what has occurred to Tyre and it causes them to fear. Joshua 13:3, 1 Samuel 6:17# It was Ashkelon that historically caused God\u0026rsquo;s people to be afraid. Ezekiel 25:15-17# …see it and be afraid in Hebrew is a play on words, TERE and TIRA.# Zechariah 9:5b Gaza too will writhe in great pain; She inflicted pain on Israel, now she will suffer pain.# Alexander sieged Gaza and after a few months it was taken.# Zechariah 9:5c Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. We are uncertain what her expectation might have been but it would be put to shame.# Zechariah 9:5d Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, it is said by a contemporary of Alexander that the king of Gaza was brought to him and he had him tied to a chariot and dragged around the city until he died.# Zechariah 9:5e and Ashkelon will not be inhabited. The people feared and fled and after Alexander passed through, the city never regained it’s population.# Zechariah 9:6a And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, God destroyed the cities and people and mixed them with a hybrid people. It may have been Alexander’s policy to mix the conquered peoples with each other.# Zechariah 9:6b And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. Jeremiah 25:20, Amos 1:6-8, Zephaniah 2:4-7, 1 Peter 5:5, Proverbs 16:18, Zechariah 9:7# Zechariah 9:7 And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Philistine pagan rituals involved drinking blood. It refers to idolatry.# Zechariah 9:7b Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, There will be a remnant of believers among the Philistines. Ezekiel 33:25# Zechariah 9:7c And Ekron like a Jebusite. When David conquered Jerusalem the Jebusites inhabited the city. David let them live and they were incorporated into Israel, Ekron will be same. 2 Samuel 24:16, 1 Chronicles 21:18# Zechariah 9:8 But I will camp around My house because of an army, While God is judging the surrounding nations, He is also protecting Israel.# Just like God used Alexander to level Israel’s enemies, God will now protect Israel.# Zechariah 9:8 Because of him who passes by and returns; This was fulfilled about 200 years later in 333b.C. when Alexander miraculously refrained from destroying Jerusalem.# Even though Alexander passed by Israel more than once, he never harmed it.# According to the historian Josephus, after Alexander took Gaza, he made his way quickly to Jerusalem. When the high priest heard this he ordered that the people should cry out to God and ask for protection.[37] # At that time the high priest had a dream where he was told to take courage, adorn the city and open the gates and that the people should appear in white garments and that all the priests should wear their priestly garments.[38] # According to the dream the priest prepared as the dream said, and waited for Alexander. When Alexander saw them, everybody was in white and the high priest in purple, Alexander approached by himself and fell before the high priest.# Later on, when asked why he had adored the priest, Alexander said, \u0026ldquo;I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit\u0026hellip;and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind.\u0026rdquo;[39] # Zechariah 9:8 And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, for now I have seen with My eyes. Zechariah 9:1, Jeremiah 16:17, Isaiah 60:18, Ezekiel 28:24# 300 years before Jesus came, God would use a Macedonian king named Alexander the Great to judge surrounding nations. The Greek language and culture became popularized throughout the world. This will set the scene for Messiah\u0026rsquo;s arrival.# Zechariah 9:9 – Behold! The King of Righteousness# Zechariah 9:9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! This is perhaps the most known verse of Zechariah. The daughter of Zion is called to rejoice greatly, to shout in triumph!# It was fulfilled during Palm Sunday about 2000 years ago, about 500 years after it was written. Zephaniah 3:15# There were two major reasons for rejoicing.# First, the king was coming. Zechariah 9:9# Second, he would set up His kingdom. Zechariah 9:10# What people did not see at the time, is that the entire church age lies between verse 9 and verse 10.# Zechariah 9:9a Behold, your king is coming to you; Zechariah announced the coming of Melech Yisrael!# From other prophecies, Israel knew that God would raise up a king who would deliver them from their enemies and usher in world peace.# God wanted a king for Israel. He just had a certain kind of king in mind, not the kind Israel desired. Acts 13:22# God wanted a king that was unlike pagan nations. A king that was just, righteous, faithful and good, one who recognized God as sovereign and he would act as earthly regent. Deuteronomy 17:14-20# An important phase in the historical development of Israelite kingship was Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s promise, delivered through the Prophet Nathan, that the Davidic dynasty would remain forever. 2 Samuel 7:8–16, 1 Chronicles 17:7–14; Psalm 87 88:3–5, 20–38# This assertion was the basis of future eschatological hopes for a new kingdom and an ideal king, and in this regard also Israelite kingship differed radically from the kingship patterns of Egypt and Mesopotamia.[40] # The king the people wanted was *like the other nations*. 1 Samuel 8:4-6# Zechariah 9:9b He is just and endowed with salvation, a just king equipped with deliverance!# Salvation is spiritual peace with God. Isaiah 45:21, 53:11, Jeremiah 23:5-6, Malachi 4:2# Why wasn\u0026rsquo;t the kingdom established upon His first visitation?# It was not because they did not want to enthrone the Messiah. John 6:15, Romans 9:33# They had wanted to enthrone Jesus by force did He not permit them. John 6:15# What the people did not understand is that in order for Him to reign as their Messiah King, they needed to return to the Lord first! Jeremiah 24:7, Malachi 3:7, 2 Chronicles 7:14# It will not be the people of Israel who enthrone the Messiah but God will do so after He has removed all His enemies. Psalm 110:1-4# Zechariah 9:9 is part of a larger unit that anticipates a time in which the people of Yahweh’s perennial adversaries will be pacified and humiliated and Philistia incorporated within it. Zechariah 9:1-8 39 # The king whose advent Jeremiah and Ezekiel also looked forward to is described according to ideal specifications. He will be strong to save and lowly and unassuming at the same time. Jeremiah 23:5, Ezekiel 34:23-31[41] # Zechariah 9:9c Humble, and mounted on a donkey, unlike Alexander, God in human flesh came to earth and chose to be born in a manger and rode into the nation’s capital, Jerusalem, on a donkey. Luke 2:7# Why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t Jesus make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding a horse? Clearly the point is made regarding his humility, but is there more?# There are over 188 mentions of horses in the Bible.# Israel, specifically the kings, were not supposed to have horses. The reason is stated in the law. Judges 12:14, 2 Samuel 16:2, 1 Kings 1:33# Deuteronomy 17:15-16a you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses\u0026hellip;“But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses*…*# God told the Israelite kings not to have horses so that they would not be prone to return once again to Egypt. Egypt was the primary provider of horses at the time. Deuteronomy 17:16b# When God delivered Israel from Egypt, he wanted them to make a clean break so they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have any reason to ever want to return. If Israel was not to return to Egypt, they must not trade with Egypt in any form.# Though it is not stated “no horses whatsoever” it is certainly implied.# When the the decalog prohibits coveting, it makes no mention of horses yet it names oxen and donkeys. Surely horses must be more desirable than donkeys\u0026hellip;Exodus 20:17# Archeological digs have found that all the nations in the area had horses but not Israel, that is, not until the time of Solomon in 970b.C. and that was out of disobedience. 1 Kings 10:26# Solomon had 40000 stalls for horses and 12000 horsemen. His horses are emphasized. 2 Chronicles 1:16-17# Remember how God said they trade with Egypt if they got into horses? When Solomon disobeyed and got horses anyway, that’s exactly what happened…# 1 Kings 10:28 Also Solomon\u0026rsquo;s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king\u0026rsquo;s merchants procured them from Kue for a price. 1 Kings 10:26-29# Knowing that Israel was not to deal in horses, passages like Psalm 20:7- 9 make a lot more sense.# Psalm 20:7-9 Some boast in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God. They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright. Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.# God did not want the people of Israel to conquer the land trusting in horses and chariots but in God. Zechariah 10:5# David\u0026rsquo;s triumphs are really a testimony that God conquered the land for them. Psalm 18:39-50# Proverbs 21:31, “The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but deliverance is of the Lord.”# By forbidding the Jewish state to acquire horses, God assured that the Israelites would be forced to fight defensive battles to protect the territory of the Holy Land that the Lord had given to them. [42] # When the people returned from Babylon, they brought with them 736 horses. This speaks of the people\u0026rsquo;s condition after 70 years in a foreign land.# The had adopted new practices from the Chaldeans and were breaking the covenant. Ezra 2:66, Nehemiah 7:68# Therefore, in keeping with the law, and true to his righteous character, when Jesus entered Jerusalem riding on what is possibly a fine-bread donkey. What a magnificent entrance in keeping with everything God says and does!# Jesus made no exceptions when dealing with Himself in His first coming. He came under the law not to abolish or rebel against it but to fulfill it.# All four gospels quote this verse as being fulfilled upon the triumphal entering into Jerusalem. Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19# On the outskirts of town people followed Jesus crying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;,# However, many in the city of Jerusalem had no idea who He was.# Matthew 21:10 And when He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, \u0026ldquo;Who is this?\u0026rdquo;. Matthew 21:1-10# Matthew 21:15 But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, \u0026ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David,\u0026rdquo; they became indignant,# The people wanted a king like the other nations that offered political sovereignty and national identity (i.e. liberation from the Romans). When the leaders of Israel realized that they had better chances of getting political power with Rome they yelled, \u0026ldquo;we have no king but Caesar\u0026rdquo;. John 19:15# The people stumbled over Jesus. The kingdom of God is more than mere politics. Entrance to the Kingdom requires absolute righteousness. This was Jesus\u0026rsquo; offer to them. Matthew 5-7# Zechariah 9:9d *Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey\u0026hellip;*a donkey\u0026rsquo;s colt was a purebred donkey, one born of a female donkey rather than one born of a mule. This made it be qualified to be a royal mount. [43] # Christ\u0026rsquo;s lowliness in outward condition reflects His inward disposition. The donkey is seen as the animal of peace. Genesis 49:11# The four Gospels include this event.# Mark 11:7 They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it.# Luke 19:35 They brought it to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.# John and Matthew make a point of quoting this passage in Zechariah\u0026hellip;# John 12:15 \u0026ldquo;FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY\u0026rsquo;S COLT.\u0026rdquo; John 12:14# Matthew 21:5 \u0026ldquo;SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, \u0026lsquo;BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Matthew 21:4# Zechariah 9:10 The King of peace# The people of Israel had suffered for hundreds of years under the oppressive hands of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medo-Persians, under Greece and upon the Kings arrival, they were under Rome\u0026rsquo;s oppressive rule.# Zechariah 9:10a I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim\u0026hellip; Ephraim here represents the land of the northern kingdom of Israel. Genesis 48:8-22# The chariot was almost exclusively used in battle. Since Israel didn\u0026rsquo;t have chariots, this refers to the removal of war caused by gentile peoples in the land of Israel. Leviticus 26:6, Joshua 9:15# Zechariah 9:10b And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; Jesus will return as a conqueror going out to war then bring in peace. Psalm 72:8# This may be what the Horseman on the red horse in chapter one is willing to go and do. Just like the patrol returned saying there was peace on the earth while Israel suffered, now, the Angel of the Lord, The Messiah himself will go out against the nations that went against Israel and bring in true lasting peace upon the whole earth. Zechariah 1:8-17# Isaiah 2:4 And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.# The United Nations has tried to appropriate this verse taking on a Messianic role. Ironically, there have been more than 150 wars since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. This is far from bringing in peace.# It was through a series of battles that Jacob had acquired possession of the land and it has been battle after battle for Israel ever since.# This would bring great hope to a people who have experienced war since they arrived on the land. This will happen when God\u0026rsquo;s King, the Messiah will reign, He will speak peace to the nations.# peace is the word shalom.# Jesus will put down all warfare and strife. The chariot, the horse and the battle bow as representing weapons of warfare. he will remove all these and bring in world Shalom.# Jesus came in humility, for a time He stooped down lower than the angels, became a man, offered himself as God\u0026rsquo;s humble yet sufficient sacrificial provision for Israel\u0026rsquo;s true return, His offer was peace, true peace, eternal peace with God.# Zechariah 9:10c And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.# Earth is the word (ERETS) which could be translated land, however since the definite article is not in the Hebrew we understand it is not referring to the land of Israel but rather the earth, referring to a worldwide kingdom. Psalm 72:8, Psalm 22:27-28# When Jesus returns to the earth, he will bring world peace in justice and truth. To be specific, will reign from sea to sea.# John says that in the eternal state there is no sea, this therefore must be speaking of a future reign after Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time and before the eternal state.# We know this will be fulfilled during the 1000 Millennial Kingdom which is after the Tribulation and before the eternal state. Revelation 20:4-6# The entire time period between Zechariah 9:9 and 9:10 was previously unseen by Old Testament prophets.# This is why the Qumram arrived at the conclusion that there would be two Messiahs. Their names were Ben-Joseph and the second Messiah would be Ben-David. They believed there would be two different Messiahs. Why? Because they did not have Paul\u0026rsquo;s writings explaining the mystery of the church.# Today, thanks to Paul\u0026rsquo;s teachings, we know it to be the church age. 1 Peter 1:10-11# Isaiah 9:6a For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; This portion was fulfilled on the first coming, but the second part of the verse has over 2000 years in between.# The second portion of the prophecy in this verse has yet to be fulfilled\u0026hellip;# Isaiah 9:6b And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.# Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.# Today God is using the church to cause the Jews to be jealous of what they missed on Christ\u0026rsquo;s first coming. Romans 11:11, 14# The church will spend 7 years in Heaven. However, then they (the church) will reign upon the earth\u0026hellip;this is a literal 1000 year reign on the earth from Jerusalem.# Revelation 5:10 \u0026ldquo;And Thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 9:11 The King of faithfulness# Zechariah 9:11a As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you,\u0026hellip; the reason for the following is given, it is because of the blood which ratifies God’s covenant with Israel.# In order for a covenant to be firm, it had to be ratified in blood. Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 26:28, Psalm 105:7-11# When a covenant was made, customarily, both parties passed between the parts of cut up animals. While they walked through the parties would declare that the same should happen to them if they break their covenant.# When God made a covenant to Abraham. It was a special ceremony because God did walked through the cut animals Himself while Abraham slept. God made a unilateral covenant without any involvement or requirement on behalf of Israel, Abraham\u0026rsquo;s descendants.# Previously we saw a covenant to the peoples which dealt with God\u0026rsquo;s holding the nations at bay to not allow them to annihilate the people of Israel.# This covenant however is far greater in its scope and fulfillment. It is referring to a covenant God made to Abraham. Genesis 15:9-12, 18-20,# This is a description of the wonderful things God will do for Israel because of his promise to her. Israel, like no other nation in the world has a covenant that God made with them. Genesis 5:9-10# God made many covenants throughout Scripture. They all kept a similar pattern. God promised he would make it, He ratified it, He clarified it, and then He fulfilled it.# The Abrahamic covenant has three major parts. Land, seed, and blessing. Genesis 12:1-3# Abrahamic covenant – was an unconditional covenant God made with Himself to Abraham. Genesis 12, 15, 17# Promised: Genesis 12:1-3# Ratified: Genesis 15:12-17# Clarified: Genesis 17:1-18# Fulfilled: Complete fulfillment will not be until the Messianic Kingdom. Revelation 20-22, Hebrews 11:9-10, Ezekiel 36:22-30# The land covenant is an expansion of the land aspect of the Abrahamic covenant. Genesis 13:14-17, Deuteronomy 28-30# The Davidic covenant is an expansion of the seed aspect. 2 Samuel 23:5# The New Covenant is in connection to the blessing part of the Abrahamic covenant.# New Covenant Promised: It may surprise you to know that the New Covenant was promised long before the church even existed. It was promised to Israel and to Judah. Jeremiah 31:31-34, Hebrews 8:8# New Covenant Ratified: Jesus’s blood served to ratify the covenant. What a guarantee that God will never go back on His promises if the blood of His son is given in vail! Matthew 26:27-28, Luke 22:20# New Covenant Clarified: Hebrews 8:9-13, 9:15, 12:24# New Covenant Fulfilled: Ezekiel 36:22-30, Romans 11:25-29# How does the Church then relate to the New Covenant? Paul said it clearest, [God]… made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. 2 Corinthians 3:6# God has incorporated the Church into Israel’s promises by making us ministers or servants of the New Covenant. One day the Church will rule and reign with Christ when the New Covenant is fulfilled in the Messianic Kingdom.# God keeps His promises (covenant) because of the blood…though Israel rejected their Messiah, God’s deliverer, and remain to this day in a state of rebellion, God will be faithful to His promise because of the blood, His Son’s blood that was shed.# If Judah didn’t believe in God’s faithful character, they should trust the blood shed of the covenant. Perhaps Zechariah’s generation was thinking of the blood of the Mosaic covenant, which serves as a type of the blood of the lamb of God. Exodus 24:3-8, 29:38-46; Mark 14:24, John 1:29# God has not discarded Israel or the plans He has for Israel. He has not replaced one single promise He has made to the church. Each and every promise God made to Israel will be kept at the right time because God is faithful to the blood of the covenant. Praise God for His faithfulness! Ezekiel 36:22# On the other hand, if God did not keep His promises to Israel based on their failures, what chance do we have of Him keeping His promises to us?# Thanks be to God, that is not the case as we are saved by grace and not of ourselves, salvation is the work of God.# Zechariah 9:11b \u0026hellip;I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit... Luke 16:24, restoration of those still in Babylon because of his covenant with them.# Cisterns without water were sometimes used as prisons. Genesis 37:24, Jeremiah 38:6# One cannot get out of a waterless pit themselves unless someone rescues them. Genesis 37:23-28# Based on the context waterless pit is not to be taken literally but metaphorically.# The people of Zechariah’s time were not prisoners of Babylon. Those who stayed behind was because they found it preferable to stay.# Therefore, the prisoners are those enslaved by sin.# Luke 4:18 \u0026ldquo;the spirit of the lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed,# Zechariah 9:12 The fortress King# Zechariah 9:12a Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; God calls them to return to the stronghold, namely Himself. Psalm 18:2, 31:2, 62:2; Jeremiah 16:19; Nahum 1:7# Zechariah 9:12b This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. When God gets them out of the pit, He promises to double whatever they had before. Isaiah 61:7# Job was granted double after his trials. Job did not know what God was going to do. Job 42# Exodus 12:17 \u0026lsquo;You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore, you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.# Daniel 8:21-25, 11:23-35# Zechariah 9:13 The warrior King# Zechariah 9:13a For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. This image of a bow and arrow refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together as God\u0026rsquo;s bow and arrow prepared for battle. Genesis 48:19# Since we know Israel and Judah have not been united since Zechariah’s time, we can say this has not occurred yet. It must refer to sometime in the future.# “The entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country [Media]; wherefore there are but two tribes [Judah and Benjamin] in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers” [44] # Zechariah 9:13b And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; Daniel 11:30# The word Greece here adds some difficulty to the passage. Many scholars believe these verses refer to the Maccabean revolution that took from 167 to 160 b.C. when the tyrannical king Antiochus “Epiphanes” IV was in power.# It is true that the prophet Daniel referred to this man as typifying the Antichrist. Daniel 11:21-35# The timeframe of Zechariah 9:1-8 is when Greece is quickly coming into being the world power when Alexander the Great conquered Syria, Phoenicia and Philistia and was headed to Egypt.# We are told God was behind this in order to prepare the way for Messiah’s coming.# The world became united under one common language, Gree# Messiah’s arrival was not when Greece was in power but when Rome was.# Therefore, in the immediate context to be writing a poem of divine conquest and preparation for the Messiah (around the time of Greece), then refer to the quality and characteristics of the Messiah and His coming (time of Rome) to jump back to the time of Greece to then jump back to refer to Israel in the days of her physical regathering (Rome) when Messiah has returns seems unlikely.# Zechariah does not say Greece but “sons of Greece”. Who might the sons of Greece be?# The simplest way to understand sons of Greece YAVAN in Hebrew, refers to the Hellenization of the people. The influence Greek culture and language had on people was vast and permeated all peoples, even the Jews.# Greeks refer to themselves as “Έλληνες”— Hellenes. The word “Greek” comes from the Latin “Graeci”, and through Roman influence became the common root of the word for Greek people and culture in most languages.[45] # The Greek teacher, Isocrates, in the 4th Century B.C. said, “And if a man should partake of our culture, let him be called Hellene”# (ii Therefore, Greece (Latin) is YAVAN (Hebrew) which is HELLENE (Greek).# Greek influence can be seen in forms of government. Humanistic viewpoint is largely based on Greek thought. Greece has dominated subsequent European thinking and culture.# The sons of Greece then, would be referring to the peoples of the world.# The sons of Zion battle the sons of Greece is saying the Jews go to battle against the world.# Zechariah 9:14 The King of power# Zechariah 9:13c-14a And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them,# Zechariah 12:1–9 teaches that there will be one last battle before Jesus establishes His kingdom, as the Gentile armies attack Jerusalem. But the Lord will use Judah as His bow and Ephraim as His arrow and defeat all His enemies[46] # Zechariah 9:14b And His arrow will go forth like lightning.# This refers to the Lord when He comes at the end of the tribulation.# Matthew 24:27 \u0026ldquo;For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.# Zechariah 9:14c And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, this is not the rapture at the last trump. God has more than one trumpet sound. This is a trumpet for Israel.# Zechariah 9:14d And will march in the storm winds of the south. Psalm 18:7–15 and Habakkuk 3:3–15# storm winds of the south - God has been known to create the whirlwinds. Job 1:19# Zechariah 9:15 The King of safety# Zechariah 9:15a The LORD of hosts will defend them. God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord of Hosts is He who defends them against their enemies. Psalm 27:10# Zechariah 9:15b And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; no weapon formed against God will prosper. Isaiah 54:17# Rather the people trample on the sling stones used as weapons in war. 1 Samuel 25:29# They would trample on the sling stones (v. 15) used in warfare, and would become precious stones in the King\u0026rsquo;s crown (v. 16).# Zechariah 9:15c And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; they are not drunk from drinking wine, rather they are celebrating from “drinking” the blood of their enemies.# Zechariah 9:15d And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. They will be “filled to the brim” just like the bowls were filled from the sacrificial blood of the altar. Leviticus 4:6-7# Zechariah 9:16 The King of salvation# Zechariah 9:16a And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; The image of the people changes from being an army to a flock. God goes from being a warrior defending them to a shepherd who delivers them.# Zechariah 9:16b For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.# They trample on the sling stones then become stones in the crown of the king.# Zechariah 9:17 The King who will bring prosperity# Zechariah 9:17a For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs!# These are the covenant blessings that will come to Israel when she returns to the Lord. Deuteronomy 28:1-14# Israel will no longer be despised but will be an attractive nation. People will want what the Jews have.# Zechariah 9:17b Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. This is when God will give them double in the land as He promised. Zechariah 9:12# Because Israel as a nation rejected their Messiah, that is, they didn’t trust in him as the promised delivered, these promises were not fulfilled at the time of His coming.# Zechariah 10:1-12 Poem of the wandering flock# Zechariah 10:1-2 The flock without a shepherd# During Israel\u0026rsquo;s periods of idolatry (Hosea 4) she ascribed fertility to Ba\u0026rsquo;al (Canaanite storm and fertility god) and not to YHWH. Chapter 10 highlights this grave mistake. Jeremiah 14:22, Zechariah 14:17[47] # Zechariah 10:1a Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain – drought was in the land due to the people not keeping the covenant. Therefore they should go to the Lord to request rain.# The springtime is an important time for the rains because farming depends on it.# People were evidently putting their hopes in other things (idolatry, good luck charms, diviners) to provide their needs, ie rain. Zechariah 10:2# Droughts on the land came about because of their wrong relationship with the Lord.# rain is symbolic of blessing or prosperity. No rain in Israel is a sign of cursing.# Spring is when they sow their seed. This is important to planting season. Joel 2:23# Zechariah 10:1b The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. why ask God for rain? Because he is the one who makes the clouds to rain. Job 36:27-28# Why would there be no rain? Jeremiah 14:22, Joel 2:23-27# Zechariah 10:2a For the teraphim speak iniquity,# The teraphim can refer to many different idols. They were generally household gods used for divination, probably shaped like human beings. Judges 17:4-5, 1 Samuel 19:13, 16# The idolatry in the land, the household idols, came into their homes and people were looking to these idols for provision instead of God.# Zechariah 10:2a And the diviners see lying visions…the visions were lies. Deuteronomy 18:14, Jeremiah 27:9, Jeremiah 29:8, Micah 3:7# Zechariah 10:2a And tell false dreams; The dreams they told were not true, they certainly were not from God. Jeremiah 23:32# Zechariah 10:2b They comfort in vain. The diviners gave them a sense of comfort, yet it was not according to reality. Job 21:34, Jeremiah 6:13-14, Jeremiah 37:19# The diviners don’t have control over the ability to rain. Telling someone it will rain soon made them feel good but it was in vain.# Zechariah 10:2b Therefore the people wander like sheep, Though they provide an immediate feeling of comfort, it is in vain because it was not based on reality. Acts 19:19# They became a superstitious people, full of good luck charms and no need for God.# Zechariah 10:2c They are afflicted, As long as these people were clinging to this idolatry, they were wandering like sheep. In fact, they were afflicteZechariah 11:7, Numbers 27:17, Ezekiel 34:5, Jeremiah 50:6# Why consult God when you can get your palm read? It provided instant gratification.# Why consult God when you have a god for that? A god that gets you what you want-even if it’s not good.# The people were consulting demons or learning doctrines of demons and being \u0026lsquo;guided\u0026rsquo; by this. They were wandering aimlessly.# Saul lost his kingdom because he consulted mediums.# Zechariah 10:2c because there is no shepherd. It does not say there was no religious leader. There was no one who cared for the flock.# Sheep aimlessly wander without a shepherd. A shepherd leads to water, leads to grass for food. A shepherd protects and keep the sheep safe. Psalm 23# Just like sheep without a shepherd are sheep lying in wait to be preyed on, so too the nation of Israel was open season for tragedy.# The people were commanded to listen to the priests. Exodus 28:30, Leviticus 8:8, Ezra 2:63# The hired hands obstruct the flock owner (Judah is God’s flock, cradle of Messiah)# Zechariah 10:3a \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; Ezekiel 34:17# Instead of being shepherds, the leaders are likened to male goats, who are worthy of blame for what has occurred. They are hired hands and don’t care for the sheep. Ezekiel 34:1-10; 1 Samuel 28:3-7; 1 Kings 16:31, 22:6-12; 2 Kings 1:2, 16:15, 21:6, John 10:1, 10, 12-13# Zechariah 10:3b For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah,# As sheep become restless, they wander, now the Lord of Hosts has come. He will comfort the flock. John 10:11,# Matthew 9:36 Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd. Isaiah 61:1, Isaiah 49:13, Luke 19:10# Zechariah 10:3c And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. The Lord will turn wandering sheep into His majestic war horse.# God is into the recycling business. He takes things that are of no use and gives them a wonderful purpose.# Zechariah 10:4a \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, the leader (Messiah) who would stabilize the nation would come from the house of Judah. Judges 20:2, 1 Samuel 14:38, Isaiah 19:13, 1 Corinthians 3:11, Isaiah 28:16, Zechariah 3:9# Zechariah 10:4b From them the tent peg, out of Judah comes one that will serve like a nail on the wall of a tent.# The tent peg refers to the large peg in an Oriental tent on which were hung many valuables.[48] # On Christ people can confidently hang their hope. Isaiah 22:23-24, John 10:28-29, Luke 19:48# Zechariah 10:4c From them the bow of battle, Israel will be made into a bow in His hands. Messiah is a mighty warrior; He will never lose a battle. Exodus 15:3-4, Isaiah 63:1-6# Zechariah 10:4d From them every ruler, all of them together. Psalm 45:4-5, Psalm 2# Zechariah 10:5a \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; What a contrast between Israel under the leadership of fleecing shepherds and God. They go from being useless and purposeless to being firmly established. Psalm 1# First, He makes them like adorned horses for battle, then he turns them into His bow and then makes them mighty men of battle.# When Jesus comes, He will be coming as a warrior and they are His weapons.# Zechariah 10:5d And the riders on horses will be put to shame. The Gentiles are those with horses. They will not be able to stand against the people of God. Ezekiel 38:4, Daniel 11:40# Zechariah 10:6a \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, God will be the source of strength of Judah and Israel will be rescued, God will gather them back into the land.# God is working on the nation, even though it was separated at the time. The house of Judah is the southern kingdom which was already in the land. The house Joseph (also Ephraim) represents the northern kingdom of Israel which was scattered among the nations.# This verse is stating the reunion of the political union of the tribes of the north with the tribes of the south.# Today the 10 tribes are scattered around the world. They appear to be spread out around the earth. Yet when this occurs, God will gather them from where they are and gather them to the land.# Zechariah 10:6b Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, when God has made all things right, it will be as if Israel had never been scattered.# God demonstrates his compassion with Israel even after their many rejections of Him.# No words can describe the compassion God has for Israel. Even more, is to think of the omniscient God who chooses to forget their sin.# Zechariah 10:6c For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. What a day that will be, when Israel at last recognizes the one who they pierced and place their trust in Him!# When as a believing nation they call on their God, He comes in response.# Zechariah 10:7a \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad those who were shepherd-less, wandering and weak from idolatry, will become strong because God is their strength.# Ephraim (north) was the son of Joseph but he was later adopted by Jacob to be one of the heirs. Genesis 49:22-26, Judges 1:22-23# Though Assyria came and overtook and scattered the northern tribes, God will one day bring them back and make them mighty.# This would have occurred when Jesus offered peace with God. Since it was rejected, it has been postponed until they do return to the Lord.# Gladness came as a result of becoming receptors of God’s grace. Their hearts will be glad.# Zechariah 10:7b as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. The blessing is such that it will be as if they had never been cast off.# Zechariah 10:8a \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; as a Shepherd\u0026rsquo;s whistle or a beekeeper\u0026rsquo;s call they are beckoned by God. Isaiah 7:18# This illustrates what the Lord will do and the people of Israel will gather to Him. John 10:27-28# Zechariah 10:8b And they will be as numerous as they were before. The land of Israel will be a time of prosperity before the division of the kingdom at the end of Solomon\u0026rsquo;s reign.# Zechariah 10:9a \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples,# This is not Babylon alone since Assyria and Egypt are mentioned later. It is referring to a plural number of people of Israel’s worldwide scattering.# Zechariah 10:9b They will remember Me in far countries, one day Israel will remember their roots and from all over the world will return to the land. We are already starting to see this in our day!# We are reminded Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s name means God remembers.# Zechariah 10:9c And they with their children will live and come back. Not the present generation but sometime in the future. Their return is to Israel (come back). This is a geographical return to Israel.# Zechariah 10:10a \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria. Isaiah 11:11# Zechariah 10:10b And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon# They will be brought to Gilead is east of the Jordan in the land of Israel.# Zechariah 10:10c Until no room can be found for them.# Zechariah 10:11a \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea,# Zechariah 10:11b So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; God will literally dry the Nile River up.# Zechariah 10:11c And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. Assyria will be humbled and brought down politically. Egypt\u0026rsquo;s authority will be taken away. Genesis 12:3,# z. Zechariah 10:12 \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Israel will once again walk by faith, strengthened in the Lord.# The state of Israel when Messiah will come# Zechariah 11:1-3 The fleecing shepherd’s wail# Zechariah 11:1-3 The Land is wailing -# Zechariah 11:4-7 flock is doomed.# Zechariah 11:8-11 God no longer favors the flock.# Zechariah 11:12-13 Israel sells out Messiah# Zechariah 11:14 Unity placed on hold# Zechariah 11:15-16 Coming false shepherd# Zechariah 11:17 God destroys Antichrist# # Due to the merchant leaders in Israel, God raises up yet another instrument to judge them. The next few verses describe the takeover of Jerusalem by Rome. This occurred in 63b.C.[49] # It is during the Roman empire that The Good Shepherd will come to offer to shepherd the sheep doomed to slaughter.# The Good Shepherd will be met with opposition and ultimately be refused by the Jewish leaders.# The temple was later burned to the ground in 70a.D. and Israel’s religious leaders had their temple hospice removed.# The Romans ruled over Judah and declared the empire “Christian” under Constantine in the 4th century.# With no temple, no shepherds and no religion, Israel as a nation was “slaughtered”. They were no morIt was not until 1948 that Israel was reborn and that the Jews started to return to the land.# Zechariah 11:1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Jeremiah 22:23# Zechariah 11:2a Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. God will go after the strong point of the nation. Exodus 27:6# Lebanon was known for its cedar while Bashan for its oak forests. Isaiah 2:13, Ezekiel 27:6# The destruction of the trees in the land could be symbolic of the destruction of the people because of the bad leadership. Judges 9:7-16# Zechariah 11:3a There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; The shepherds\u0026hellip;wail\u0026hellip;their glory (the temple) is ruined. Jeremiah 25:34-38# Lebanon furnished timber for building the temple. Ezra 3:7, 5:8, 6:4# Because the religious leaders abused the power given to them by using the temple and the people for profit, God will remote the temple and with it their glory.# Jeremiah 25:34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.# Jeremiah 25:35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.# Jeremiah 25:36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.# Jeremiah 25:37 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.# Jeremiah 25:38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.# Ultimately the temple was destroyed by the Roman Titus in 70a.D.# Zechariah 11:3b There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. The young lions can be heard roaring because the pride of the Jordan is in ruin. Jeremiah 50:44# Zechariah 11:4-14 Good Shepherd poem I# Zechariah 11:4-6 The avaricious shepherds# The context of chapter 11 is obviously the rejection of a godly leader and his replacement by wicked leadership. Jesus saw Himself as both the wounded Shepherd (cf. Mark 8:32-33; 9:32-34; 10:35-37) and the Good Shepherd (cf. John 10).# This passage aligns well with Zechariah 13:7-9# Zechariah 11:4 Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. Like before, Zechariah will take up mimes to explain what is going to occur.# Zechariah is asked to act out the role of a Shepherd who actually pastures the flock.# Zechariah 11:5a \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, the leaders were mercenaries, buying sheep to slay them and make a profit.# The picture here is of Israel being delivered into the hand of their oppressors.# Zechariah 11:5b and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; The religious people get rich from the oppression of the people.# Zechariah 11:5c And their own shepherds have no pity on them. Unlike the good Shepherd who has compassion for the sheep, these hired hands don’t have any pity.# Zechariah 11:6a \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; Just like they had no pity, now God will show them no compassion.# Zechariah 11:6b \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; This is referring to Israel under the oppression of Rome.# The leaders will declare, “we have no king but Caesar”. John 19:12, 15# Zechariah 11:7-14: The Good Shepherd pastures the flock# Zechariah 11:7a So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. God had said to pasture the flock…This role know to have been fulfilled Jesus but Zechariah was acting it out. Zechariah 11:4# This sort of acting out God’s word was a method applied by Isaiah, Jeremiah and especially Ezekiel.# Zechariah 11:7b And I took for myself two staffs: Zechariah proceeds to get into his role of shepherd and takes up two staffs.# Why two staffs? Eastern shepherds carried one rod to beat away beasts from the sheep and a crocked staff to retrieve sheep from a cliff or from tangled places.# The purpose of the good shepherd was to pasture the flock. What does it mean to pasture a flock? Sheep need to be lead to pasture in order to eat. A shepherd knows where to lead the sheep to green pasture. Psalm 23# In same way, The Good Shepherd will come to feed or teach the people.# Jesus came with the purpose of teaching the people. He used to rods to shepherd.# Just like a shepherd has two staffs as means to pasture. The Good Shepherd calls one rod Favor and the other is called Union, signifying His purpose. He has come to grant favor and unity.# Zechariah 11:7c the one I called Favor… favor NOAM means pleasantness, or graciousness. One of the staffs is given the name “favor” to represent how God in grace had favored Israel. Deuteronomy 7:7# Zechariah 11:7d and the other I called Union; union CHEBEL means rope twisted together. God\u0026rsquo;s desire was to take the divided nation and unite them. Ezekiel 37:15-28# Zechariah 11:7e so I pastured the flock. Zechariah plays the role of a good Shepherd. Psalm 23# Every Shepherd is encouraged to take note. The Good Shepherd come to pasture (feed) the flock.# The Good Shepherd uses favor, graciousness on the flock.# The Good Shepherd uses union; He binds the flock together.# Psalm 23:4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.# Zechariah 11:8 Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month\u0026hellip; the shepherd that came with favor and union in his hand suddenly takes a protective role and stands between the prey (religious leaders) and those being preyed on (the people).# The word annihilated KACHAD means to destroy. Here in the sense of cutting down of power.# This verse is possibly the verse that has the most interpretations of any other verse in the Old Testament.# \u0026ldquo;One writer has counted forty different interpretations of these words\u0026rdquo;.[50] # The context of this passage is during Christ\u0026rsquo;s first coming. The three shepherds are removed within one month. Zechariah 10:3, Matthew 21:42-46# \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;These three shepherds are the Pharisees and Herodians, the Sadducees.\u0026rdquo; Matthew 22:15-16, Matthew 22:23, Matthew 22:34-35# These three groups were religious leaders at that time.# (ii During His first coming, these three groups set aside their differences in order to get rid of Jesus Christ.# (iv) In order to get the death penalty, they became allies with Rome.# When Rome destroyed the temple in the 5th month 70a.D. this was a death blow for these groups.# According to the Mishnah, both temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av. This could hardly be seen as a coincidence.[51] # Today Israel mourns for the destruction, not of one but of two temples, on the same day! They cry for the Temple to be rebuilt yet fail to return to the Lord.# Zechariah 11:8 for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. The Lord’s impatience is a human term, so we understand, not because the Lord is impatient. The soul of the fleecing shepherds grew tired of the good shepherd.# Zechariah 11:9 Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. The problem was with the shepherds, not the people in this case. We are given a greater understanding of this in the Gospels.# Because the religious leaders continued to reject the teachin and caused Israel to turn away, Jesus began teaching in parables about the coming Kingdom. Matthew 13:10-11, 13-15# Soon afterward, the focus began to change from being only to Israel to be primarily to the Gentiles. Acts 28:26‑28# Zechariah 11:9 What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; Previously we were told the three shepherds were going to be annihilated. God is going to let it play out and they will end up devouring each other. Matthew 15:14# Zechariah 11:10 I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. Zechariah grabs everyone’s attention when we breaks one of his staffs into pieces, symbolizing God breaking off a covenant with the nations.# The imagery of the staff breaking makes us think the covenant is no more. However, the word break is PARAR also has the idea to frustrate or thwart. Perhaps this should be viewed as a postponement.# Favor extended to the flock is frustrated. Since the flock rejected the Good shepherd, this was understandable. However due to the fact that favor was directed to the Gentiles through Israel they are affected by the rejection of Israel’s leaders. Therefore, the covenant to the peoples is delayed.# The staff symbolize instruments to pasture the flock. Therefore, what was broken is the faculty to pasture. That is, the ability to give favor in protecting the nation.# It is difficult to be dogmatic about what covenant this could be referring to.# This is not any covenants God made with Israel. Not merely a covenant to the people (Israel) but to all the peoples (nations). Isaiah 56:6-7# We aren\u0026rsquo;t told this specifically but by implication, God has made a covenant with the peoples of the earth in relation to His own people Israel.# One suggests, God has placed the nations under restraint lest they work Israel harm or ill.\u0026rdquo;[52] Job 5:23, Ezekiel 34:25, Hosea 2:18, Genesis 12:3, Romans 15:8-9# A covenant made with the peoples cannot refer to the Mosaic since that covenant was made with Israel only.# Regarding Israel\u0026hellip;the promise has not been broken, only postponed. And postponement is not abandonment with God. That is what Zechariah 14 shows.[53] # Zechariah 11:11a So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me\u0026hellip;the afflicted of the flock refers to the small number of believing Israel. Luke 12:49-53# Zechariah 11:11c realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; Matthew 26:15, Mark 14:10-11# Zechariah 11:12b but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. The chief priests paid Judas Iscariot 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus. Matthew 26:14-16# Zechariah 11:13a *Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter…*Zechariah is told to act this out in the temple and it symbolizes what actually will occur when the religious leaders will pay Judas to betray Jesus.# Zechariah 11:13b that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; This is sarcasm is a remark on the little value they placed on Him. Isaiah 53:3, Acts 4:11# Zechariah 11:13c So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. This was fulfilled when Judas returned the money to the chief priests and they in turn used it to buy a piece of land from the potter to use as a burial site for stranger. Matthew 27:3-7, Matthew 27:9-10# While the chief priests were willing to pay 30 pieces of silver for the Messiah, God sacrificed His only Son. The chief priests arranged their payment in secret while God paid in plain view for everyone to see. The chief priests maintained their political power (for a time) but God maintained perfect righteousness (forever).# Zechariah 11:14 Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. Zechariah acts out the breaking of the second shepherd’s staff. With the rejection of the Shepherd comes the scattering of the sheep. A sheep without a shepherd will be prone to be scattered.# In 70a.D. the temple was destroyed by the Romans and the people were scattered.# If Messiah would have been placed as king he would have reunited the kingdom. The tribes of the north and the tribes of the south would have been one again. 1 Kings 12, Jeremiah 31:31# Zechariah had said Messiah would come and unite the two kingdoms. Zechariah 10:6-8,# Ezekiel talks about two staffs coming together. This happens in the millennium.# Judah and Israel will only be united when the Messiah is their Shepherd and brings them back together.# Christ came in the name of the Father, He was not received. Another should come in his own name, and him the people would receive.[54] John 5:43# Zechariah 11:15-17 The False Shepherd# Zechariah 11:15 \u0026ldquo;The LORD said to me, Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. Zechariah is asked to continue the charades but this time he was to change his apparel to impersonate a foolish or worthless shepherd.# Foolish EVILI means silly or foolish. Someone who does not take God into account is called a fool. “The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God”” Psalm 14:1# Jesus said He was The Good Shepherd. He laid His life down for the sheep. John 10:10-11# Yet they valued Him like a worthless shepherd.# This foolish shepherd lays down the life of the sheep for his own.# This illustrates what the lack of discernment the people have and will accept him as their shepherd. John 5:43# Zechariah 11:16a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land\u0026hellip; This could mean the shepherd will be a Jew or one in Judah. He comes from the land, raised up by God.# The difference between this false shepherd and the previous false shepherds is that this one was not chosen by the people. He is raised up by God to be an instrument of judgment upon them.# Zechariah 11:16a a shepherd\u0026hellip;who will not care for the perishing, This shepherd has other interests. He is not a good shepherd.# Instead of feeding the flock he will not care and leave them starving.# Daniel sheds light on this shepherd\u0026hellip;he will be a wicked king\u0026hellip;# Daniel 11:36 \u0026ldquo;Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished\u0026hellip;# Paul describes him this way\u0026hellip;# 2 Thessalonians 2:4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.# The temple of God refers to the Tribulation temple. Antichrist places his throne in the temple, as though he were God.# The Tribulation temple is thought to be the same temple as the one in Ezekiel 40-48. This cannot be since the Branch will build it when He comes and the people will come from all over to build it.# The temple is a holy temple, built to God. If that were not the case then Antichrist couldn’t desecrate it. The abomination of desolation is contingent upon the fact that the temple is holy to some extent at least.# This refers to the abomination of desolation Daniel spoke of at the midpoint of the tribulation period.# Daniel 11:37 \u0026ldquo;He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will magnify himself above them all.# Revelation 13:4 they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, \u0026ldquo;Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?\u0026rdquo;# Because the Antichrist gets his ruling power directly from Satan (the dragon), when people worship him, they are really worshipping Satan.# Revelation 13:6 And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.# Revelation 13:7 It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.# Revelation 13:8a All who dwell on the earth will worship him\u0026hellip;# Though God will permit Antichrist to rise to power, his reign will be temporary and brought to an end at the end of the 7-year Tribulation period.# Revelation 13:5 \u0026hellip;and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.# Zechariah 11:16b a shepherd\u0026hellip;who will not\u0026hellip;seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. This evil shepherd is worse than the fleecing shepherds. He will devour them. John 10:10# Evidently the nation of Israel must have had a time of peace and safety since it refers to them as fat. Antichrist comes into power offering peace.# Israel experiences up to about three and a half years of peace before Antichrist breaks the treaty after 42 months.# Tearing off the hoofs of the sheep probably represents the shepherd as extremely greedy, searching for the last edible morsel that he can extract from his charges whom he has consumed.[55] # Zechariah 11:17a \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! Woe, take pity, because God will destroy this false shepherd. John 10:12# Zechariah 11:17b A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo; The arm represents power, the eye intelligence. These will be destroyed. God will remove his power and his intelligence. Revelation 13:3# his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye utterly darkened. - JNDarby translation# A sword will hurt the Good Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7# Summary of Antichrist# He does not care for the people of Israel.# He will be a man who comes up from the land of Israel,# not interested in women# later given great satanic authority to continue reigning as king. It seems at one point he receives a fatal blow and is miraculously restored to life. At least enough time for him to come back and reign another 42 months (3 1/2 years).# He will use the Jewish people to achieve his goals.# Ultimately, he will persecute the Tribulation saints (those who believed during the Tribulation period).# Zechariah 12:1-14:21 The Burden regarding Israel# The following three chapters (12-14) could easily be the most important eschatological chapters for Israel. These chapters clearly reveal future events in the life of Israel that God uses to bring about a turn around after being rejected for a undescribed period of time.# Zechariah 12:1- A Day of Mourning# Key theme in burden 2: Day of the Lord regarding Israel. This term appears 18 times in this burden.# It provides us with more details. The Battle of Armageddon (Revelation), thes destruction of those nations. Correlates with 1st and 8th visions.# Repentance of Israel is necessary for Messiah\u0026rsquo;s return.# The same Shepherd that was rejected in the first burden will come and rescue them in this burden. The King on the donkey will return riding on a horse.# The false prophets - relates to 7th vision.# Shows us what life will be during Millennium# Now, Zechariah, in pertaining things of the future, he will go back to God as creator and owner, setting a creator-creature distinction.# Zechariah 12:1-3 A time of world focus on Jerusalem# Zechariah 12:1 A threefold declaration of God as creator and owner.# Zechariah 12:1a The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. While the first burden was regarding the nations, this second burden is specific to Israel. Israel here does not mean the northern tribes alone but all of the Jewish nation.# Zechariah 12:1b Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, God has authority over the heavenly realm. Genesis 1:1, Isaiah 42:5# When Moses is about to begin instructing Israel regarding their identity as a people, he begins by teaching God as creator and owner and therefore supreme authority.# The verbs in verse 1 imply a continuous action. God continues to stretch, lay and form.# Zechariah 12:1c lays the foundation of the earth, He also has authority over the earthly realm Genesis 1:1, Job 38:3-6# Zechariah 12:1d and forms the spirit of man within him, God is over the human real.# Humans have a material part (physical body) and an immaterial part (the soul). God has formed man\u0026rsquo;s spirit within him. Genesis 2:7# The \u0026ldquo;spirit\u0026rdquo; of man means the unique person with the potential of rebellion or fellowship. Psalm 139[56] # These three expressions show God as the creator is no doubt owner and fully empowered over creation to do as He wishes. God has all the necessary credentials.# This is like when Jesus, when about to interact with the 7 churches in Revelation. Each time he introduces himself according to what He will say. Revelation 2-3.# Zechariah 12:2a \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; God will raise up Jerusalem to cause stumbling to the nations.# Reeling (RAAL) - staggering - something that causes one to stumble like in a drunken stupor. The nations won\u0026rsquo;t be able to control themselves. They will gravitate to Jerusalem. The center of the tension will be Jerusalem.# Jerusalem will become an obsession to the nations. It will make them stumble around like drunken people.# This may be fulfilled when the peace treaty is signed.# Zechariah 12:2b and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. The central focus of the nations appears to be Jerusalem which is at the center of Judah, therefore it will also be attacked.# Zechariah 12:3a \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples.# In that day\u0026hellip;this is when the nations of the world come up against Jerusalem, Jerusalem will become a heavy stone as well as cup that causes reeling. Zechariah 12:2, Psalm 75:8, Jeremiah 25:15-16# Zechariah 12:3b all who lift it will be severely injured. Jerusalem is like an immovable stone that the more the nations try to move it, will be cut. Genesis 12:3# Joel 3:2 I will also gather all the nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of my people and mine inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land.# Since the nations of the earth cut the land of Israel, God will divide them.# God is creator and owner of the earth. Also, of man\u0026rsquo;s spirit within him. Is God limited to moving someone\u0026rsquo;s spirit in one direction or another? God says if you try to move or affect Jerusalem in any way, I will do it to you! This is true throughout history not just during this time. To all the peoples of all time.# This time refers to the whole period of the Tribulation.# Those who try to mess with the apple of God\u0026rsquo;s eye will have to deal with God.# Zechariah 12:3b And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. Not some, but all are gathered in array against Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:2,# This is the insanity of the nations against Israel.# This hasn\u0026rsquo;t happened yet, but Zechariah says it will happen one day. When? We can\u0026rsquo;t be dogmatic but there are certain clues in Scripture.# Possible scenario:# Israel is regathered in the land. Ezekiel 37:12, Isaiah 11:11-42# Ancient cities rebuilt and inhabited. Ezekiel 36:1-5, 8-10# (ii Muslim Arab resistance - Jeremiah 49, Isaiah 17, Zephaniah 4:2, Jeremiah 49# (iv) Must be a level of security and prosperity. Ezekiel 38:10-12# (v) Gog and Magog - perhaps this will be the catalyst to sign the peace treaty. Daniel 9# (v Midpoint of The Tribulation. Matthew 24:15-21# (vi1260-day period - second half of Daniel 70th week. 1/3 of nation will be protected while they are hunted down by Antichrist.# (viii) Nations gather at the valley of Jehoshaphat (Armageddon) to form one army. Revelation 16:16, 19:18-21# (ix) The army of the nations moves south to attack Jerusalem.# All of history is building up to this climactic moment of confrontation with evil. Psalm 2; Isaiah 8:9-10, 17:12-14; Ezekiel 38-39; Daniel 9:24-27, 11:36-45; Joel 3:9-17; Zechariah 14:2; Revelation 16:14-16, 19:17-19# This burden probably begins near the midpoint of The Tribulation# Joel 3:9 Proclaim this among the nations: prepare war, arouse the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.# Joel 3:10 Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.# Joel 3:11 Haste ye and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.# Joel 3:12 Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.# Joel 3:13 Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down, for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.# Joel 3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of decision.# Joel 3:15 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.# Joel 3:16 And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: and Jehovah will be a shelter for his people, and the refuge of the children of Israel.# Zechariah 12:4-9 The Lord of Hosts defends Jerusalem. Psalm 21:4# Zechariah 12:4a \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment.# Zechariah 12:4b and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah,# I will watch over…is a term in Hebrew for care and attentiveness. 1 Kings 8:29, 2 Chronicles 7:15, Nehemiah 1:6# There is some question as to Judah’s involvement. It is uncertain whether they are for or against the people of Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:4c while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. The nations come against Israel on horses. Ezekiel 38-39,# blindness - removed from Jewish people, Zechariah 12:10# blindness and madness is an interesting combo. It relates back to Deuteronomy 28:28.# It is a dangerous thing to go against Israel. Israel\u0026rsquo;s true iron dome is God. Psalm 21:4# Zechariah 12:5a \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts… In order for Judah to recognize their help comes from the Lord, they have to have their blindness removed. Judah recognizes in their hearts that their defender, the one who fights for them is the Lord of Hosts. Proverbs 4:23, Nehemiah 4:20# Zechariah 12:5b \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; Judah is coming to the realization perhaps they are on the wrong side of history.# This seems to be saying that Judah will recognize the importance of the God (their God) of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.# Judah was participating in the takeover of Jerusalem, but changed their minds when they saw the faith of Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s defenders.# Just like Israel, we too have blindness that needs to be removed. We too have things that we regard as strengths and one by one God has to show us that those are hinderances rather than strengths.# Zechariah 12:6a \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, Once God is on their side (they trust God) they will become mighty and untouchable.# Zechariah 12:6b so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, Judah goes from being an enemy to being a mighty force in God’s hands.# Zechariah 12:6c while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem will be back in her place. The land is theirs by right. The creator of the earth has deeded them the land.# They are dwelling on their own sites. Ezekiel 34:13, 36:24, 37:14, 21; Leviticus 25:23# Zechariah 12:7a \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, save here refers to physical protection. Hebrews 11:7, Philippians 1:13# tents could be understood as military camps or as homes - defenseless people of Judah.# Zechariah 12:7b so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. people living in the city have fortification (gated community). Both those in the tents (homeless) and those in the city will be saved in the exact same way.# Success will not be attributed to human ability.# The Lord will defend the tents before the protected capital so that both recognize it is the Lord. Both will realize the victory is of the Lord.# In order for the instrument not to take credit from God, he often chooses the least qualified people to use.# Gideon - least of his clan# Moses - isn\u0026rsquo;t qualified. Not a speaker.# Jeremiah - Who am I? I am but a youth# If God can work through a flawed instrument, people won\u0026rsquo;t say it was them, people are obligated to say God did it. if we believe that we are inadequate for God, take heart, we are precisely the kind of person God has used throughout history! 1 Corinthians 1:26-31, 2 Corinthians 10:17# God will work so that human pride will not be indulged. [57] # Zechariah 12:8 \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem,# Zechariah 12:8 and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, God is their strength. They are supernaturally powerful. The oldest and weakest will be like David!# It was known and even songs were written about David’s God given prowess in battle. 1 Samuel 18:7# Zechariah 12:9a and the house of David will be like God, just like David’s victories were God supernaturally fighting for them, so it will be on that day.# Man’s thinking he can become like God started in the very beginning. That is not what this is saying. Genesis 3:5, Isaiah 14:14# It was common during the Greeks and Romans to think wars were won if the gods accompanied you.# This should be understood as they will seem like God ELOHIM in the eyes of their enemies. Even as Moses did before Pharoah. Exodus 7:1# Zechariah 12:9b like the angel of the LORD before them.# The Angel of the Lord is limitless in His power. Isaiah 37:6# The reason they will look like the Angel of the Lord before them, is because it really is the Angel of the Lord fighting for them.# Zechariah 12:9c \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. In this case it will not be luck or the numbers or ability of a certain leaders but of the God of Israel who destroys all the enemy nations.# Zechariah 12:10 - A Day of Mourning# Zech title# Zechariah 12:10a \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, only when Israel comes back will God pour out His Spirit. Ezekiel 36:24-25, Joel 2:28# I will pour out… is often used to express God pouring out His Spirit. Ezekiel 39:29; Joel 2:28,29; Isaiah 44:3# Spirit is RUAH. There is no article in the Hebrew. This is not a reference to the Holy Spirit but to the human spirit.# Positive attributes of the human spirit# Deuteronomy 34:9 \u0026ldquo;filled with the spirit of wisdom\u0026rdquo;# Isaiah 28:6 \u0026ldquo;a spirit of justice\u0026rdquo;# Negative attributes of the human spirit# Numbers 5:14,30 \u0026ldquo;a spirit of jealousy\u0026rdquo;# Isaiah 19:4 \u0026ldquo;a spirit of distortion\u0026rdquo;# Isaiah 29:10 \u0026ldquo;a spirit of deep sleep\u0026rdquo;# Hosea 4:12 \u0026ldquo;a spirit of harlotry\u0026rdquo;# God is pouring out a grace spirit in verse 10 as a result of their conversion and removing an impurity spirit (RUAH) in verse 12. The land is mourning in verse 10 but is cleansed in verse 12. This is the working of the Holy Spirit.# The completion of the second temple was a small foreshadowing of this major event. Zechariah 4:5# The prophets spoke of the day when God\u0026rsquo;s Spirit would be poured out. It would be the dawning of a new age when all the promises made would be fulfilled. Isaiah 32:15, Joel 2:28-32, Ezekiel 39:29, Isaiah 44:3# Zechariah 12:10b …so that they will look on Me… the word translated \u0026ldquo;on\u0026rdquo; in this verse should really be translated as \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;unto\u0026rdquo;. That is, the people looked to Him for deliverance. They looked unto Him for the deliverance of their sin. Isaiah 45:22, Numbers 21:9, John 3:14-15# Zechariah 12:10c …whom they have pierced; The description can fit none other than Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified in the year 33a.D. Numbers 25:8, Judges 9:54, I Samuel 31:4, I Chronicles 10:4, Psalm 22:16-17, Zechariah 2:11# John confirms the fulfillment of this prophecy as he stood from afar and watched Jesus being crucified and pierced through with a spear. John 19:34-37# Typically, Jews killed people by stoning. John 8:58-59# However, Zechariah foretells the Jews pierced Him. Psalm 22 predicts the crucifixion 1000 years in advance. Isaiah 53:5 is a prophecy 700 years in advance of the cross. But Zechariah’s prophecy is 3000 years ahead of its fulfillment.# This is the moment when all of heaven (and a few from earth) have been waiting for in this nail-biting series.# The order of events is important. Zechariah makes this clear. The faithfulness of God is seen growing exponentially while at the same time Israel’s sinfulness.# To Zechariah’s generation God had said, “Return to me, I will return to you” To the next generations he continues, “return to me, I will return to you”.# Jesus, God in the flesh, came proclaiming in person, “return to Me, I will return to you”.# (ii The people rejected Jesus. They killed the Lord of glory! 1 Corinthians 2:8# (iv) Today, through the Church, even through jealousy, God is calling out to Israel, “return to Me, I will return to you” Romans 11:1, 11-14# (v) In the midst of war, in their greatest of woes ever, their blinders are removed, and they realize who Messiah really was and that He had come to save them thousands of years earlier! He had been the lamb of God who came to remove the sins of the whole world. In a moment, all of Israel changes their minds and turns to the Lord. All of Israel puts their faith in Him.# (v Almost as a child calls for his daddy, Israel as one, calls out to the Lord for deliverance from their enemies, “Abba Help!”# In a moment, in a flash, they will all see the same Jesus, the same man that was pierced, coming in the clouds. Every eye in Jerusalem will see Him. Jesus the Messiah will come back, yes…the very one they had pierced. Just like God had been announcing all along, if you’ll return to me…I WILL COME BACK (RETURN) TO YOU!# Revelation 1:7 BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.# Christian, there is nothing you can do that can separate you from the love of God in Christ!# Are you a Christian? Why? Are you a Christian because you have prayed asking God to forgive you? God had already paid for your sins at the cross. Did you ask Him to somehow do it again? This does not make you a Christian.# Are you a Christian because of asking Jesus to be your Lord? Jesus is the Lord of the living and the dead. He doesn’t need you to make Him anything. He is God. This does not make you a Christian.# Have you realized the penalty of your sin is death eternal and there is absolutely no possibly way to make that right by changing your ways or doing good. This is why Messiah came to die because it was the only way.# The only requirement to receive the free gift of salvation is faith. John 3:16, Acts 16:30-31, Ephesians 2:8-9# We are justified freely by his grace. Romans 5:1# (ii Upwards of 150 passages in the Bible condition receiving salvation to believing only. [58] # Friend, have you placed your faith in the person of Christ and His finished work alone for your salvation? There is nothing you have done that His death on calvary does not cover. Are you confident this same Jesus died and rose again for you too? Trust in Christ alone to be saved. This is what makes you a Christian!# Zechariah 12:10c and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, The loss of a son, an only son is among the greatest sorrows known to man.# When Israel comes to life, they will begin to sob with great sadness. The moment of realization comes after they are delivered spiritually. They all will receive the Holy Spirit and God will give them a spirit of grace. Hearts that feel with deep intensity the error of what they did when they crucified the Lord of glory. Matthew 5:4# Some say that in order to be saved one must mourn, feel profound shame and guilt for sin. If this is true, then Judas would have been saved. Hell will be filled with people who felt a deep sadness but never trusted in Christ.# The nation here is exerting sadness because they are saved. They are deeply moved by God’s gracious gift. He gave his only son to they might return to Him and He to them!# It is the Spirit that teaches us the deep appreciations of the Person of Christ and His work which in turn gives us a spirit of grace. Titus 2:11-13# They will see Jesus of Nazareth in a new way! Upon realizing who He is and what He did they will be impacted by their response of rejection. Their self-righteousness had taken them to crucify God\u0026rsquo;s Shepherd who in turn gave His life for the sheep.# The Holy Spirit includes several instances in Scripture of grieving parents over their only son. Luke 7:12-15, Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10# Joseph story: brothers betrayed him, then his brothers reunited. They rejected him then received him. Gen 50:20, Gen 45:14, The brothers are a type of Israel\u0026rsquo;s story when they are reunited with their Messiah.# Zechariah 12:10-13:1 The Deliverance of Judah# Zechariah 12:10 and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. In a Jewish home, the firstborn was an especially important person. [***59]*** # Just like God gave His only Son, they will feel in a human sense the profound sense of weight the free gift of salvation cost God to procure it for man and the immense error of their way for having rejected him for 3 millennia.# Matthew 5:4 \u0026ldquo;Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.# Zechariah 12:11a \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem,# Zechariah 12:11b like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 2 Chronicles 35:25-27# Josiah, one of the last godly kings, when he died there was great weeping. In Josiah\u0026rsquo;s death, the last hope for Judah faded and the people wept uncontrollably.# Some say this refers to weeping over the Canaanite god Ba’al, however the context does not seem to indicate that. 2 Kings 5:18# The plain of Megiddo is the valley of Armageddon. Revelation 16:16# As this conflict is taking place, the whole nation starts to weep uncontrollably.# Zechariah 12:12a \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself;# This describes a individual revival taking place in a national sense. Matthew 24:30# Matthew 24:30 \u0026ldquo;And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the land lament, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. Darby# Zechariah 12:12b the family of the house of David\u0026hellip; David represents the regal authority over the nation. 2 Samuel 7:16# Zechariah 12:12c the family of the house of Nathan\u0026hellip; represents the prophets. 2 Samuel 7:17, 12:7# Zechariah 12:13a *the family of the house of Levi\u0026hellip;*the priests too will mourn.# Zechariah 12:13b the family of the house of Shimeites by itself… non-priestly Levites who weren\u0026rsquo;t necessarily priests will mourn by themselves.# Zechariah 12:13c and their wives by themselves; the wives of the royal family, the prophets, priests and all the Levites will weep,# Zechariah 12:14 all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. this is individual mourning on a national scale because God has saved them from their sins. Romans 11:25-26, Jeremiah 5:31, Jeremiah 30:7# Zechariah 13:1-5 Spiritual cleansing of the land# Zechariah 13:1 \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened… The day of Israel’s salvation will be like a fountain flowing with forgiveness. Isaiah 12:2-3, Jeremiah 2:13, Romans 11:26-27, Ephesians 5:26, Titus 3:5# There will be an interval period of 75 days. Daniel 12:11 1290 days - Midpoint to end of tribulation is 1260 but 1335 (+45)# 12 and 13 are so close, some suggest a chapter division was uncalled for. Israel converts in chapter 12 but is cleansed in chapter 13.# God\u0026rsquo;s life-giving water will now flow forever. [60] Zechariah 14:8, Ezekiel 47:1-12, Revelation 22:1; Ps. 46:4).# Zechariah 13:1 for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. this fountain pictures the cleansing that takes place in Israel. Ezekiel 36:24-28, John 3:3, 5# It involves cleansing of the land of wickedness. This connects well with the flying Scroll of vision 6.# Zechariah 13:2a \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, Idolatry will be removed from the land.# Commandments #1 and #2 deal with idolatry. Ignoring these first two commandments is what got Israel sent into exile.# Zechariah 13:2b and they will no longer be remembered\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 13:2c-5 False Prophets removed# Zechariah 13:2c and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.# Here unclean spirit has the article. It refers to one spirit in particular. Satan was blinding people to the Gospel and to believe the deception of the false prophets. This will be removed. 2 Corinthians 4:1-6# Revelation 20:1 - Satan will be bound for 1000 years. So he would not deceive the nations. Idolatry will not be started again because they will be bound up.# False prophets can do miracles. They say, “let\u0026rsquo;s follow other gods”. They contradict what God has said. Their predictions are inaccurate. Deuteronomy 18:20-22# Demonic influence is removed\u0026hellip;there’s no temptation to idolatry. Those born in Millennium will have freedom to choose for or against God. None of Israel will reject God, however. It will come from the nations.# Zechariah 13:3 \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; This is a return to the law. Deuteronomy 13:1-5# Parents who have children who have false prophets will execute them. This will be a fear of the Lord, not a fear of the religious leaders. John 9:21-23# Zechariah 13:3 and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. Deuteronomy 13:6-10# Zechariah 13:4 \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, Jeremiah 23, Ezekiel 13# All teaching must be tested. How do we test it? By placing it in light of Scripture. 1 John 4:1# Zechariah 13:4-5 and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; The dangerous situation for false prophets will cause them to go into hiding.# Samuel, Elisha, Elijah, and John wore heavy robes. 1 Samuel 28:14, 1 Kings 19:13, 2 Kings 1:8, Matthew 3:4# False prophets, in order to deceive look the same. They are really wolves but have the outward appearance of sheep (look authentic). Matthew 7:15# Zechariah 13:5 but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; They will pretend they aren\u0026rsquo;t prophets at all. They will lie about their vocation. He will say he is a farmer rather than a prophet.# Zechariah 13:6a \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; People will ask him about the wounds between his arms.# Him in the context is a false prophet trying to avoid being caught.# Traditionally this verse has been interpreted to say that this is talking about Jesus. To see Jesus in this passage is simply a poor hermeneutic as the context will not allow it.# False prophets and would cut themselves to enhance their ecstasy, to increase ritual potency, or to identify themselves with a particular god. 1 Kings 18:28; Jeremiah 41:5; 48:37# The false prophet will be easily recognized by special cultic marks on his body. \u0026ldquo;Between his arms\u0026rdquo; is a Hebrew idiom for somewhere on his back, chest, arms, or hands. There seem to be two OT allusions to this practice: [61] # the prophets of Ba\u0026rsquo;al. 1 Kings 18:28) [62] # special pagan practices for mourning. Leviticus 19:28, 21:5; Deuteronomy 14:1; Jeremiah 16:6, 41:5, 48:37[63] # Zechariah 13:6b Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; False prophets, in order not to get caught, will say it was an accident to avoid further questioning.# Friends or lovers is a term often used in the Old Testament for people who practice idolatry. Jeremiah 22:20,22; 30:14; Ezekiel 16:33,36,37; 23:5,9,22; Hosea 2:7,9,12,14,15# H. Zechariah 13:7-9 – The Good Shepherd poem II# Zechariah 13:7a \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, God commands the death penalty upon Messiah. Isaiah 53:10# With the genre change between the prose in verses 1-6 and poetry in 7-9 comes a huge break in subject change. It goes from talking descriptively about false prophets to a poem about the Good Shepherd.# Contrary to popular opinion, when God gave His son, Messiah, it was to be the sin bearer for all of humanity not to come and not merely to show us a better way to live. Isaiah 53:12, John 3:16, Romans 5:8# God allowed the Jews to have their way and to convince Rome to hold a public crucifixion of an innocent man. The penalty for the sins of mankind was not a secret arrangement between an illuminated few but rather presented to the whole world because that’s who He died for.# Zechariah 13:7b *And against the man, My Associate,\u0026quot;*literally, “the man of my union.”# Zechariah 13:7c Declares the LORD of hosts. The identity of the Messiah, He will man and divine# The Lord of Hosts’ Associate is only used here and in Leviticus. Leviticus 5:21, 18:20, 19:15,17, 24:19, 25:14,15# The Shepherd is struck with the sword. Jesus quotes this verse to His Disciples referring to himself as the shepherd and they as the sheep. Matthew 26:30-31# When Israel rejected the Son, it was because they had rejected the Father.# Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep.# The little ones - the disciples were scattered, Israel was scattered because they crucified the Shepherd. Deuteronomy 4:27# Mark 14:27-28 And Jesus said to them, \u0026ldquo;You will all fall away, because it is written, \u0026lsquo;I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.\u0026rdquo;# Jesus quotes Zechariah then continues saying that He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah’s message with the Gospel accounts.# Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound. Notice how it is God who plays the leading role in Messiah\u0026rsquo;s work. He causes him to be stricken. It is also God raises Messiah back to life three days later. Acts 2:32# Isaiah 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.# Jesus was smitten of God. The next verse goes on to explain why\u0026hellip;# Isaiah 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed.# The word scourging (CHABBURAH singular) is another word for blow or wound. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins.# Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do these 500 years in advance. He would strike down the Shepherd, turn His hand against the little ones and raise the Shepherd back up. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.# The Gospel was God\u0026rsquo;s eternal plan for the redemption of man.# Jesus\u0026rsquo; death on the cross is the maximum expression of love and justice merging together at one place. The perfect justice requiring a perfect sacrifice was realized when God\u0026rsquo;s Son Himself paid with His life. At that same moment, God demonstrated His love for mankind. Romans 5:8# Zechariah 13:8-9 Israel is Fully Restored# Zechariah 13:8 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish;# Two thirds of the Jewish people will die in the land. Ezekiel 28:38# Hitler is known for having killed 6 million Jews. That is an estimated one third of Israel. What will happen at this time (Tribulation) in history has nothing comparable to it neither will there every be anything like it.# Matthew 24:15 - abomination of desolation. Let the reader understand - flee to the mountains.# Zechariah 13:8-9 But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, The immediate context refers to the land, two thirds of the people perishing and one third surviving, we can assume then the fire must also be literal.# The refiners fire is the way metals are purified. 1 Peter 1:6-7# This fire will serve God\u0026rsquo;s purposes to test the Jews and to look heavenward and call on the name of the Lord.# The remnant that survives would include the 144,000 sealed Jews mentioned in Revelation 7:1-8 and 14:1-5# God has to move heaven and earth to bring about Israel\u0026rsquo;s restoration.# Zechariah 13:9a Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested.# In the days of Zechariah, a refiner would take the raw gold or silver and place it in a ceramic container. Inside the container was the ore—not just the precious metal, but also impurities such as zinc, lead, and salt.[64] # The ceramic container was put into a fiery kiln for five days. During those five days, all of the impurities would separate to the outside edges of the container. Nothing would be left in the middle of the vessel but the pure silver or gold. [65] # This sort of metallurgic term to symbolize a spiritual refining is used in other passages. Proverbs 17:3; Isaiah 1:25, 48:10# Zechariah 13:9b *They* will call on My name… they will call because they had believed earlier. Romans 10:9-10. Calling on His name brought physical deliverance. They were already saved before this.# This verse contains covenant phrases. Hosea 2:19-23# It has a chiastic structure using they, I, I, they.# When will the Jewish nation call on the Lord? At the end of the Tribulation. Matthew 23:37-39, Psalm 118:26, Joel 2:32, Romans 10:13,# Zechariah 13:9c And I will answer them.# Romans 11:26 - the remaining 1/3 will be saved.# God will one day answer them because he is promising right here that this is what He will do.# Zechariah 13:9d *I* will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; God has returned to them because they had returned to Him in faith.# Zechariah 13:9e And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026quot;…The Lord is my God will be proclaimed. Psalm 43:4, Romans 1:8# Upon their successful response to the testing, once again Israel will be seen to be God\u0026rsquo;s people among the nations. They will be the light to the Gentiles. Isaiah 42:6, Acts 13:47# Zechariah 14:1-7 - Jerusalem\u0026rsquo;s Deliverance# Israel is the naval of the earth. Ezekiel 5:5# The naval is set in the center of the human body, so the land is the naval of the world, situated in the center of the world in Jerusalem. Jerusalem in the center of the land of Israel. And the sanctuary in the center of Jerusalem. The holy place in the center of the sanctuary, and the ark of the covenant in the center of the holy place, and the foundation stone before the holy place because from it the world was founded. [66] # A thirteenth-century crusader map places Jerusalem at the center of the earth\u0026hellip;the map depicts the earth as a three-leaf clover, each leaf being a continent: Europe, Asia, and Africa. The three are drawn together by a ring encircling a single city; that city is Jerusalem.[67] # Verse 12 tells of Jehovah smiting his enemies and their “flesh” being consumed. Again, this cannot refer to a period after the literal return of Christ; the Coming of the Lord will signal “the end,” at which point the dead will be raised, and the living - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye - will be changed from flesh to a new, spiritual essence. We will pass from corruption to incorruption, from mortality to immortality (1 Cor. 15:23-24,51-53).# Three main views exist regarding the Millennium and the interpretation of Zechariah chapter 14.# Some hold it to be a symbolic prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, together with a spread of the gospel throughout the Christian age thereafter.[68] # Some say it is a depiction of the history of spiritual “Jerusalem” (the church), from the time of its commencement on the day of Pentecost throughout the Christian age.# Chapter 14 are Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy regarding a future fulfillment when Messiah returns to the earth to establish a literal earthly kingdom in Jerusalem.# Zechariah 14:1 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. The nations who took from Jerusalem will be returned.# You…is singular referring only to Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:2# Then the Lord will return their spoil. Zechariah 14:14# Just like God took away, He now turns to bless them.# The interpretive key here is a day is coming. This clearly refers to the Day of the Lord which is a period of time.# They day of the Lord stands in contrast to man\u0026rsquo;s day. Currently man is having his day but a time will come when God will openly intervene with the affairs of man, first for judgment, then for blessing.# The day of the Lord in its broadest sense refers to the period of time beginning with the rapture and continuing until the creation of the new heavens and new earth.# However, the Day of the Lord does not always refer to the whole period of time. Context helps determine what portion of the day is being referred to. It could mean any one of the following:# The Tribulation period# The Second Coming# The Millennium# The entire period between the Rapture until the new heavens and the new earth.# There are different terms used to describe the nature of the Day of the Lord.# Wrath. Zephaniah 1:15, Zechariah 14:1-9# Judgment. Revelation 14:7# Indignation. Isaiah 26:20-21# Trial. Revelation 3:10# Trouble. Jeremiah 30:7# Destruction. Joel 1:15# Darkness. Amos 5:18# Desolation. Daniel 9:27# Overturning. Isaiah 24:1-4, 19-21# Punishment. Isaiah 24:20-21# Glory. Isaiah 11:10# Praise. Isaiah 12:1, 4# Salvation. Isaiah 25:9# Worship: Isaiah 27:13# Zechariah 14:2-3 The Great Tribulation# Zechariah 14:2a For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, The war of all world wars. The city of Jerusalem vs the nations of the earth.# verses 2 and 3 cover most of the Great Tribulation period, the second half of Daniel’s 70th week.# God makes the nations join against Jerusalem. Ezekiel 38-39, Zechariah 12:3, Ezekiel 5:5, Ezekiel 38:12# Zechariah 14:2b the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, The people inside Jerusalem will take a beating. For a time, the city will be captured. 2/3 of the nation will be destroyed.# If Israel is Gods chosen why were 2/3 killed? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t all be saved? Election has to do with Gods choice for purpose, not destiny. God chose Israel to be a light, to be the ethnicity of the Savior, to be the keeper of the Old Testament Scriptures, and so much more. An Israelite must believe to be delivered from hell. God didn’t choose the whole only 1/3. This is saying God made them believe. He does not do that however he did know they would since he knows all things.\nZechariah 14:2c but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. The people outside of the city will not have access to help.# When the Romans came against Jerusalem in A.D. 70 they came with a multinational army and brought terrible destruction on the city and its people. Yet there was none of the deliverance that Zechariah will describe in the following verses, so it is difficult to say that this was fulfilled in the Roman attack upon Jerusalem in A.D. 70.[69] # Zechariah 14:3-7 The Return of the King!# Zechariah 14:3 Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. Just about when things seem lost, when no one else will help Israel, the Lord will come and turn it all around. Psalm 121:4, Exodus 4:2,# Messiah will come and supernaturally overcome the nations going against Jerusalem. He no longer comes in reference to sin but as a conquering warrior. He returns as the Lion of Judah.# Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.# Revelation 19:12 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.# Revelation 19:13 He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.# Revelation 19:14 And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses. This is the Lord of Hosts coming.# Revelation 19:15 From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.# Revelation 19:16 And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, \u0026ldquo;KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.\u0026rdquo;# 7 Literal Events Foretold when Jesus Descends in Zechariah 14:4-9# Messiah’s feet will stand on the mount of Olives# The mount of Olives will be split# The saints will return with Him# The remnant will flee# The luminaries will dwindle# Living waters will flow# The Lord will be King over the whole earth# Zechariah 14:4a In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; 2 Samuel 15:30, Acts 1:9-12, Matthew 24:3,# the Mount of Olives rises to a height of 2,710 feet, making it higher than the Temple Mount.# The last time God descended on a mountain in this way was in the giving of the law. Exodus 19:18# Jerusalem, and to the east, the mount of olives are physical places. Jesus Christ is physically coming back to earth. Job 19:25# This is not the rapture of the Church. The rapture is not a return where we are caught up to meet the Lord in the air.# Jesus\u0026rsquo;s feet will first touch the earth where they left, on the Mount of Olives. Just like Jesus left physically, he will return physically. Acts 1:9-11# Zechariah 14:4c and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, The instant Jesus touches it, it will split the mountain.# An oil company doing seismic studies found a major fault in this area going east to west precisely through the mount of Olives. It is so severe that it could split at any time. It is waiting for Messiah’s feet to land. Ezekiel 38:19[70] # Zechariah 14:4d so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. The mount of Olives will split. Evidently this allows for the remnant to flee Jerusalem and also for the waters to flow. Zechariah 14:8, 13:1; Psalm 46:4; Ezekiel 47:1-12; Revelation 22:1# Zechariah 14:5a You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; The remnant will flee when this happens. Azel could be a village near Jerusalem. Micah 1:1-11# Zechariah 14:5b yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Josephus mentions an earthquake in connection with Uzziah’s sin (pride) as king decided to go into the temple to act as priest. [71] Amos 1:1# Zechariah 14:5c Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! The holy ones is the church. Revelation 19:14, Revelation 1:6, 5:10# Angels will also be coming with Christ. Matthew 25:31, Jude 14,# God’s faithfulness and protective power during this gruesome attack on Jerusalem remind us that our safety does not depend on our distance from danger. Our safety is in God\u0026rsquo;s hands. He keeps us through the most dangerous times we will ever face.# Zechariah 14:6 In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. Matthew 24:29, Revelation 16:10# Zechariah 14:6 For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD,# Zechariah 14:7 neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. At the point of evening, light comes.# When it is supposed to be the darkest, it becomes the lightest. Jesus is called the Morning star. 2 Peter 1:19, Revelation 2:28, Revelation 22:16# Zechariah 14:8-21 - The Millennial Kingdom# Zechariah 14:8a And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, while the fountain in chapter 13 is spiritual, these waters appear to be life giving waters that flow from east to west. Isaiah 33:21-23, 60:19,20# In the day national Israel acknowledges Jesus\u0026hellip;these things will come about.# The whole kingdom program is riding on Israel\u0026rsquo;s response to their king. The whole earth could believe but if Israel does not, there will be no kingdom. However, though only Israel believe and no one else in the world believe, the kingdom will come.# The kingdom comes after Jesus returns in a literal, physical coming. This does not happen until Israel returns to the Lord.# Zechariah 14:8b half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea.# The Mediterranean Sea is referred to as the western sea. The Easter Sea is the Dead Sea, which will no longer be dead. Ezekiel 47:1-12# East and West in relation to what? In relation to Israel, and specifically Jerusalem. This is God\u0026rsquo;s compass rose.# Today there is an ongoing battle regarding an area known as the \u0026ldquo;west bank\u0026rdquo;. West in relation to what? It is not west of Israel; it is west of Jordan. So, from God\u0026rsquo;s perspective that land should be called the \u0026ldquo;East Bank\u0026rdquo;. Every time we use the term \u0026ldquo;West Bank\u0026rdquo; we are using an anti-Israel perspective. It’s better to use terms like Judea and Samaria.[72] # Zechariah 14:8c it will be in summer as well as in winter. that is, it will never dry up. During the 1000 years of Christ, these waters will flow year around.# Zechariah 14:9-21 Christ\u0026rsquo;s earthly reign# Zechariah 14:9a And the LORD will be king over all the earth; Jesus functioning as king is yet future to Zechariah.# Jesus is prophet, priest and king.# In his first coming Jesus carried out the role as prophet.# Today Jesus is acting as high priest at the Father\u0026rsquo;s right hand.# Jesus is sustaining the universe.# Jesus is interceding before the Father# Jesus is presenting us as standing before the Father.# In the Millennial age, Jesus Christ will exercise his role and King over all the earth not heaven. Revelation 3:21# David\u0026rsquo;s throne is earthly# David\u0026rsquo;s throne is in Jerusalem# Revelation 20:3 Satan is bound; actual true justice comes to earth.# The Lord will be king\u0026hellip;not happening yet. Then He will be king over all the earth. This is not heaven.# It\u0026rsquo;s an earthly restoral of what Adam lost in the garden of Eden. Luke 4# We must be careful to distinguish the Millennial age from the Eternal state.# The Messianic Reign is Eternal but 1000 years of it is transitional# Millennium Age Eternal State Satan is in the Abyss Satan is in the Lake of Fire Seas No Sea Death No death, mourning or pain Luminaries - Isaiah 30:26 No sun moon or stars Temple - Ezekiel 47 No Temple Evil No evil Partial curse No Curse Plagues Sin Nature Salvation by faith Faith is no longer, all saved Temporary Eternal Transition Time Timeless Rebellion The eternal state will NOT include:# Satan - he is in the lake of fire (not the abyss)# Sea - Zechariah just mentioned two seas# Death no mourning or pain - There will be no rebellion ever. That\u0026rsquo;s not what Zechariah is talking about. No reign, no rain.# Luminaries - Sun, moon - Isaiah 30:26# Temple - Ezekiel 47, from the temple will flow waters.# Evil, Curse, Sin nature# Zechariah 14:9b in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. He is the only candidate, he is the only one in line, there is not debate, no question, there is no doubt, he is the only one.# Zechariah 14:10-15 The King will arrange His Kingdom# Zechariah 14:10a All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem;# Zechariah 14:10b but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s gate was in the northern wall of Jerusalem. Isaiah 2:1-4# Zechariah 14:10c as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. Jerusalem has risen, but certain things have remained.# These places are specifically mentioned because it means to show us literal, physical locations.# Zechariah 14:11 People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.# Jerusalem will be repopulated. Zechariah 8:4-5# There will no longer be a curse in Jerusalem. Israel now lives under the New Covenant provision that is not conditioned upon obedience to have blessings or cursed if they disobey.# Not only Jerusalem, but the whole earth will be repopulated.# Zechariah 14:12-15 - Judgment on Nations# Zechariah 14:12a Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; God has a record of the nations that have attacked Israel.# If God promised to bless nations through Israel, why on earth would the nations wants to do anything to disrupt that divine blessing?# A light offense against Israel is returned by God by a heavy offense against the nation.# Exodus 4:22 - God said he would bring plagues against the enemies of Jerusalem.# Zechariah 14:12b their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. Nuclear reaction? Chemical weapons? Matthew 24:21-22 - if the 7 year tribulation had gone on, nobody would have lived through it.# Flesh rots while standing on Feet# Eyes rot in sockets# Tongue rots in mouth# Revelation 6:8 75% of the earth is eliminated. 50% world\u0026rsquo;s population is destroyed.# Revelation 11 - Two Witnesses whole world will watch them die and come back to life. This is easily possible today through live television.# Zechariah 14:13a It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them.# God causes great panic. Many times, man in a state of fear goes against each other.# Zechariah 14:13b and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.# Man starts killing each other.# Judges 7:22 - Gideon didn\u0026rsquo;t have to do much. God caused great fear and they killed each other and fled.# Ezekiel 38:2 - Every sword will be against one another.# Zechariah 14:14a Judah also will fight at Jerusalem.# Genesis 49:10 Messiah comes from Judah.

Israel has to be in a state of wealth. Specifically in Silver and gold and clothing in great abundance.# in 1867 Mark Twain said the land was a barren expanse.# In our lifetime Israel has become a nation.# Israel is in the process of becoming phenomenally wealthy. Her gross domestic product is far better than her neighbors.# Israel has discovered oil in their land.# Ezekiel 38:12 - 14# Israel\u0026rsquo;s gold from the period of Solomon has been vastly lost. It appears as though the Israeli\u0026rsquo;s hid it. So much so that subsequent generations lost track of it. Will there be an unearthing of the silver and gold that was hidden? The nations will steal it, but eventually God will return it back to them. Zechariah 14:1, 14# Zechariah 14:15a So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, These are the enemy animals. Ezekiel 38:4# The landform between Israel and Syria is divided by the Golan Heights. IT is impassable by modern vehicles. It must be passed by horseback.# The Golan Heights now belongs to the people of Israel.# Zechariah 14:15b the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. When the plague hits all these animals it will make it difficult for these nations.# The horse is still used in warfare in certain terrain.# The enemy comes into Israel through mountains. What mountains? The Golan Heights would fit that perfectly.# The animals are needed to pass the Golan Heights. [73] # Zechariah 14:16-19 Kingdom Worship# As Prophet, Priest and poet, Zechariah is given an appropriate way to end the book!# The Nations Worship# Zechariah 14:16a Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem… There will be some nations left at the end of the Tribulation that went up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 8:20-23; Isaiah 2:2-4; 45:21-24; 60:4-14; Ezekiel 40—48; Philippians 2:10# Whoever is left of the nations - two judgments that take place on the earth for tribulation survivors. Some will be saved, some will not.# Unbelievers who survive will be cast off into Hades. Surviving believers will enter the Millennium age.# The Millennium will begin with mortals who happen to survive the Tribulation and are believers.# There is a parallel judgment for surviving Jews that will take place in Acts 20:30-34# There will be no unbelieving Jews at this time.# 4 Future Judgments for the World# Bema Nations Israel Great White Throne Church Remaining nations Remaining Jews at the end of the Millenium Zechariah 14:16b will go up from year to year to worship the King, the specific purpose the nations have for going to Jerusalem will be to worship the King. This is a monarchical type of government. The King will be God and that nations will come to render homage to Him.# Jesus\u0026rsquo; three offices past, present, future# Prophet Priest King Past Present Future First Coming Now Seated Messianic Kingdom Isa 65:25# King Jesus is not reigning yet. This is still future. Just like David was anointed but never actually reigned until Saul was deposed, so too Messiah has been anointed and waiting the time set by God the Father to reign upon His own earthly throne. 1 Samuel 16, 2 Samuel 2, 2 Samuel 5# It is not until Satan (as Antichrist) is deposed that Christ will reign. First Messiah receives the title of the earth based on Him being worthy as the Lamb who was slain. Then Antichrist must be chained and thrown into the Abyss, then Messiah will take his rightful place and begin His ministry as King reigning from the city of Jerusalem.# That is why when Satan is released at the end of the Millennium, he goes straight to attack the Beloved City (Jerusalem) because he knows where the authority is. Revelation 20:7-9# Zechariah 14:16c who is the Lord of hosts\u0026hellip;There is no mistaking the identity of this King. He is the Lord of hosts. The Father has bestowed on Him the role as Lord of hosts. Psalm 24:10, Jeremiah 48:15# Kingship in Israel was integrated into a theocratic system in which Yahweh alone was considered King and absolute ruler of the universe. Exodus 15.18;19.6; Numbers 23.21; 1 Samuel 8.7; 12.12; Judges 8.23 [74] # The human king was but Yahweh\u0026rsquo;s earthly regent. Yet here see a regent who is the Lord of hosts. That is, this human earthly regent is the universal sovereign. Revelation 19:16, Psalm 24:10# Zechariah 14:16b and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. The Feast of Booths of one of three of the most important feasts in the life of Israel. It was a time of grateful rejoicing. Leviticus 23:40, Deuteronomy 16:14-15, Nehemiah 8:17# Leviticus 23 gives the Jewish feasts. One of those is the Feast of Booths. It commemorates the provision of the Lord.# Celebrated The Feast of Booths does not imply that the Kingdom is once again under the Mosaic law.# There are usually objections to taking the temple and sacrifices literally.# While there are similarities in the sacrifices, they are different, just like Noah\u0026rsquo;s sacrifices were different from Moses\u0026rsquo; sacrifices. Those sacrifices all pointed ahead to one who would come. The sacrifices done in the Millennium will point back.# All these differences show that this is not a return to the Law of Moses but is rather a Kingdom Law. How is it different?# Mosaic Law Kingdom Law Only Priest has access to temple All have access Relates only to Israel Includes Israel, Church and the nations distinctly No horses allowed Horses Nations unaffected Nations only receive rain if they come to feast of booths each year. This is the only feast that Zechariah mentioned that is celebrated. However, Zechariah 8:19 mentions turning mourning into feasts.# The Apostle Peter mistakenly concluded that the messianic kingdom had begun when he saw Jesus transfigured (Luke 9:33). He suggested that the disciples make three booths for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. This indicates that the Jews in Jesus\u0026rsquo; day associated the Feast of Booths with the beginning of Messiah\u0026rsquo;s kingdom, which is the same connection that Zechariah made here.

The families of the earth are the remaining people of the nations of the world.# Zechariah 14:17b to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. They will come to Jerusalem for the express purpose of worshipping the King. Matthew 2:6# First the eternal Angel of the Lord was seen to be a man. Then we see the man presented as a King. Now the King is presented as the Lord of Hosts and reigning in Jerusalem. Nations will come to him to worship. Matthew 2:2# Unlike any other king in the history of mankind, this King holds the world in His hands. He controls the wind and the rain. This will cause people to fear him as it did the disciples. Mark 4:39-41# The nations will need to walk by faith just like they have in any other age. They will need to trust in Messiah for salvation for what He did on calvary, They will need to walk by faith trusting in Messiah\u0026rsquo;s provision over the power of sin and also trust in Messiah to provide their material needs.# Failure to keep Kingdom law results in curses. Specifically in this case, they will get no rain.# The Millennial Kingdom – three distinct parts; Israel, Church and Nations# This new age brings God\u0026rsquo;s fulfilment of the New Covenant to Israel and Judah who will be a united nation. Jeremiah 31:31# At the same time, in her glorified state, the ministering of New Covenant administration will be responsibility of the Church.# Messiah deals with the nations in terms of blessings and curses depending on their relation to Him.# For Israel, as light unto the Gentiles, she will keep temple ritual.# Zechariah 14:18a If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; Egypt is a nation mentioned by name. In the millenium, Egypt will depent on God’s provision for rain, otherwise they will be cursed.# Zechariah 14:18b it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. God has turned the tables. Egypt is now dependent on Israel\u0026rsquo;s King to survive. They must render homage every year to the King in Jerusalem, otherwise they are not sent any rain.# Zechariah 14:19 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. Any nation who does not trust in the Lord to present themselves before the Lord on the Feast of Booths, will not receive any rain the following year.# Zechariah 14:20-21 The Holiness of The King will prevail# Zechariah 14:20a In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; Since Egypt has been given her rightful place in relation to Israel, we now see horses used in Israel. The horses are seen to contribute to the glorification of the LORD.# In the kingdom, instead of using the horses to fight, they are used to ring bells that read \u0026ldquo;Holy to the Lord\u0026rdquo;.# This speaks of a new dispensation no longer under the law. Under the law, Israel was prohibited to own horses. If one point of the law must be changed, the whole law is affected. James 2:10# Therefore, we conclude this must be a new administration, the fulfillment of the New Covenant, no longer under Mosaic law but a multi-program administration under the Spirit of grace and supplication where priesthood and royalty are joined in one office characterized by a rule of peace and a rod of iron.# This is a new administration where God includes Christ as King of the nations, Israel as His dearest subjugates, Jerusalem as His capital city, Zion the mountain of his throne, the Church as His beautiful queen and the angels as his personal ministers.# During the age of Law, only the turban of the priest held an inscription, \u0026ldquo;holy to the Lord\u0026rdquo;. Exodus 28:36# During the 1000 year reign of Christ, even the minutest things like bells on horses will be considered set apart for the worship of the Lord. The point is, worship is an integral part of life, all-inclusive unto the Lord.# The new means of walking will proceed from Zion in Jerusalem, not Sinai. Isaiah 2:1‑4# The whole life will be pervaded by the holiness of the LORD. The people will then be the holy nation that God has always envisioned. Exodus 19:6 [76] # Zechariah 14:20b And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Here the cooking pots in the temple are likened to the 100 bowls in the temple. 2 Chronicles 4:8# Zechariah 14:21a Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; Every pot throughout the land will be usable. Not just those set apart for use in the temple.# Zechariah 14:21b and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. Every pot in the land will be usable for cooking the sacrifice. The implication is that all are sacrificing not just the priest as seen in Levitical law. Leviticus 6:24-28# Zechariah 14:21c And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day. Genesis 9:25-27, Isaiah 35:8, Ezekiel 43:7, 44:9; Revelation 21:27# The house of the Lord is referring to the 4th Temple of the Millennium. Canaanites will be no more. Deuteronomy 23:3-4# Revelation 11:5 \u0026ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever.\u0026rdquo; Zechariah 14:9# Major climactic breakthrough at end.\nIn the end we all will say Israel suffered a lot. Israel will reply yes, but we are so glad God used it to bless us. In fact their suffering will be light compared to the heavy weight of the millennial and eternal blessings.\nGod knows whay we need when we’re sick. Feast of booths levels all classes of life.\nVI.Doctrines in Zechariah# \\ The Day of the Lord – an eschatological period of time that starts some point after the rapture and ends at the end of the Millennium.\n\\ The Second coming – This is the return to the Mount of Olives of the Lord Jesus at the end of the Tribulation.\n\\ The Tribulation – Daniel announced 70 weeks would pass before Messiah’s reign to be established. 69 weeks have passed. The last week is known as The Tribulation.\n\\ Armageddon. Often refers to the final battle at the end of the Tribulation when the nations go against Jerusalem. Actually Armageddon (Harm-Megiddo) is the place where the nations will meet. The actual war will take place in Jerusalem. Revelation 16:14-16\n\\ Gog and Magog. Ezekiel 38-39\n\\ New Covenant - It is commonly understood that the New Covenant is now, for the church. That cannot be for several reasons: The New Covenant was promised to the house of Judah and the house of Israel. Jeremiah 31:31. The New Covenant conditions have not been met. The New Covenant promises have not been fulfilled. The Church program has not replaced God\u0026rsquo;s program for Israel. God\u0026rsquo;s promises must be fulfilled with the nation of Israel in order to fulfill the many prophecies and, \u0026ldquo;then you will know I am the Lord\u0026rdquo;.\nThe units of volume mentioned in the Bible are the following:# homer.

It is to abide where it originated and where it has always belonged. The cycle of wickedness, as it were, is complete. Godlessness in every form has finally come home.\n[26] John F. Walvoord The predictions of Isaiah have to do with Babylon’s ultimate destruction in the Day of the Lord. The near and the far view are often mingled as in chapter 13. The destruction of Babylon is pictured in Isaiah 13:1-11 as part of God’s program to punish the entire world (cp. 13:11). The historic conquering of Babylon by the Medes and the Persians is mentioned specifically in Isaiah 13:17-19 The prophet seems to refer to the far view, that is, the destruction of Babylon in relation to the second coming of Christ. Isaiah 13:20-22.\n[27] John F. Walvoord the prophecies of Jeremiah are notable because they were delivered at the peak of Babylon’s power when it seemed most unlikely that the great nation would fall. Babylon is pictured as being punished because of its cruel treatment of Israel (50:17, 18; 51:24, 49).Practically all of the predictions of Jeremiah seem to relate to the fall of Babylon by the attack of the Medes and the Persians. Only occasionally does there seem to be a reference to a future ultimate destruction as in Jeremiah 51:62-64. The prophecies of Jeremiah predicting the fall of Babylon at the hands of the Medes and the Persians were graphically fulfilled approximately sixty-five years later, as recorded in Daniel 5\n[28] Jewish Virtual Library https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jerusalem-as-the-earth-rsquo-s-center-judaic-treasures\n[29] Dr. Andy Woods audio series Zechariah on SermonAudio\n[30] Dr. Constable\u0026rsquo;s Notes on Zechariah 2022 Edition\n[31] Unger, p. 109.\n[32] The Aramaic Targum is an ancient interpretive paraphrase of the Hebrew Bible, the Jerusalem Talmud is one of the collections of Jewish civil and ceremonial law and legend, and a Midrash is a commentary on the Hebrew Bible.\n[33] Constable\n[34] Meredith Kline – the Exaltation of Christ\n[35] E.g., Leupold, p. 124.\n12 Charles Feinberg, The Minor Prophets\n[36] Leslie M.

First over the wall was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, the son of the former dictator and a senior officer in Pompey\u0026rsquo;s army. He was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, who each led a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews, 12,000 of whom were slaughtered. However, only a few Romans troops were killed. Pompey himself entered the Temple\u0026rsquo;s Holy of Holies, which only the High Priest was allowed to enter, and thus desecrated it. He did not remove anything, neither its treasures nor any funds, and the next day, he ordered the Temple cleansed and its rituals resumed.

This same theory also appears among the Essenes of the Dead Sea community.

The temple had been destroyed because Israel had not trusted God. Their motives were clearly misplaced. They were lamenting the consequences of their actions rather their actions themselves. It was empty rote.\nGod has purposed one day to do good to Israel but first Israel is to be in a state of belief in the land. God will change their sorrow to joy. Fasting to gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore they are to love truth and peace in the present. They are to trust God in the present knowing the promises of better days to come.\nZechariah 9:1 The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD),\nZechariah 9:2 And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.\nZechariah 9:3 For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.\nZechariah 9:4 Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.\nZechariah 9:5 Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.

Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; Then the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.

Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo; Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo; Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be calledthe Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificialbasin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemyin the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomedto slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, thatmagnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=============================\n================================\nZechariah\n(Chronology)\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.\nThen I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.\nThen I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificialbasin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemyin the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.\nThen the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=========================\nZechariah possible: Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah to the World (Phrased)\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.\nThen I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you— indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel— these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.\nThen I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.\n\u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days, \u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificialbasin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain— The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.\nThen the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=========================\nZechariah# possible title: Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah to the Nations# (Phrased + Indented)# • Why study the book of Zechariah? • It reveals behind the scenes Spiritual warfare • It reveals Israel\u0026rsquo;s future kingdom and the nations under it. • Because God remembers his promises (Meaning of Zechariah). • IT is because of the prophecy of this book and teh book of Haggai that the temple was rebuilt. Ezra 4:5 After 70 years God raised up a man named Cyrus to open the door to Juda\u0026rsquo;s return to the land. This return happened in three waves. The first wave was led by a man named Zerubabel. This first return is the time at which the prophecy of Zechariah is given. Upon Juda\u0026rsquo;s return to Jerusalem they first rebuilt the altar of the Lord and reestablished sacrifices. Also, the Temple was to be rebuilt with donations of material and money (Ezra 3:1–7) but up to the point where Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy begins, only the foundation has been laid. Opposition from the Samaritans has delayed the work about 18 years.\nMessage #1 - God\u0026rsquo;s call to return# In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, Cyrus was the first Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, the persian succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the writing of Zechariah in 520 B.C.. Perhaps Scripture dates the writing of the book in reference to a Gentile king because Daniel's \u0026quot;times of the Gentiles\u0026quot; is now underway. No Jewish king is reigning. Jerusalem is being trampled underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24 the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, Zechariah is a young prophet. He never saw the first temple as he was a baby when he come from Babylon. Some scholars ascribe Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah. the son of Berechiah, evidently Zechariah's father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra. the son of Iddo Iddo is Zechariah's grandfather. He is listed among the priests who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 4 saying, \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, (the people who have returned) \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\nThis is most important to notice. Who is the LORD of hosts? THE LORD OF HOSTS: (Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of armies used 235 times in the Bible). Tza-va (צבא) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the plural. Multiple armies of which are included the angelic beings. Genesis 2:1 mentions the hosts being created. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. “You are the Lord, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host.” (Nehemiah 9:6). and all the host them, of the heavens and the earth; the host of heavens are the sun, moon, and stars, often so called in Scripture, and also the angels; Luke 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Host can be stars Her 8:2\nFor behold, He Who forms mountains \u0026amp; creates the wind \u0026amp; declares to man what are His thoughts, He Who makes dawn into darkness and treads on the high places of the earth, the LORD God of hosts (Sabaoth) is His name. Amos 4:13) So, God is first seen here as the creator of the hosts. In Samuel 1, Elkanah and family are seen going yearly to Shiloh to sacrifice. Hannah is the first person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. Later (1 Samuel 17:45) David invokes this name of God when going before Goliath. 2Sa 5:10 David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. 1Ch 11:9 David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him. [2Sa 6:18](verseid:10.6.18) When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offering, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.2Sa 7:27 \u0026quot;For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to Your servant, saying, 'I will build you a house'; therefore Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You. LOH AS KING: Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory?The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah Isa 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. Zec 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.' The LORD of Hosts is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. This is central to the message this prophet has. Revelation 19:11-20 hosts: 1Ki 22:19 Micaiah said, \u0026quot;Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many. Isa 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14 Psa 84:1-12....How blessed is the man who trusts in You!\nHOSTS AS ARMIES: Ex 7:4 Lord of hosts as the leading General of Israel's army. “If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah.” (Isaiah 1:9). (2Ki 6:15) \u0026quot;Do not fear, for (term of explanation) those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\u0026quot; (2Ki 6:16, cp 1Jn 4:4-note). Isa 13:4 A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. Isa 19:16 In that day the Egyptians will become like women, and they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which He is going to wave over them. You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any who are treacherous in iniquity. Selah. [Isa 1:24](verseid:23.1.24) Therefore the Lord GOD of hosts, The Mighty One of Israel, declares, \u0026quot;Ah, I will be relieved of My adversaries And avenge Myself on My foes.Isa 2:12 For the LORD of hosts will have a day of reckoning Against everyone who is proud and lofty And against everyone who is lifted up, That he may be abased.Isa 5:7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel And the men of Judah His delightful plant. Thus He looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; For righteousness, but behold, a cry of distress. Nah 2:13 \u0026quot;Behold, I am against you,\u0026quot; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026quot;I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.\u0026quot; Isa 1:24, Mal 4:1 \u0026quot;For behold, the day is coming, burning like a furnace; and all the arrogant and every evildoer will be chaff; and the day that is coming will set them ablaze,\u0026quot; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.\u0026quot; Mal 4:2 \u0026quot;But for you who fear My name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings; and you will go forth and skip about like calves from the stall. Mal 4:3 \u0026quot;You will tread down the wicked, for they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,\u0026quot; says the LORD of hosts. PSalm 103:20-21, Matt 13:41, Matt 24:30-31, LOH as REDEEMER: Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel. (Isaiah 47:4), Isa 19:20 It will become a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Champion, and He will deliver them. Isa 44:6 \u0026quot;Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me. Isa 47:4 Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel. Jer 50:34 \u0026quot;Their Redeemer is strong, the LORD of hosts is His name; He will vigorously plead their case So that He may bring rest to the earth, But turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon. Mal 3:17 \u0026quot;They will be Mine,\u0026quot; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;on the day that I prepare My own possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him.\u0026quot; Zech 14:16, Isa 44:6, Rev 22:13 Psa 59:5 LOH as HOLY: Is 6:3 ...\u0026quot;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.\u0026quot; Jer 32:18, Although one might disagree on what \u0026quot;host\u0026quot; refers to in a given verse, the important truth is that Jehovah is LORD over ALL HOSTS, whether they are the host (armies) on earth, the stars or the angels (good or bad).Isa 5:16 But the LORD of hosts will be exalted in judgment, And the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness. \u0026quot;All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN \u0026amp; among the inhabitants of earth \u0026amp; no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, 'What have You done?\u0026quot; Da 4:35 Lord of hosts as Holy: But the Lord of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. Isa 8:14. Jer 11:20,\nIsa 37:16 \u0026quot;O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, who is enthroned *above* the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.\nA mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing: For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe; His craft and pow\u0026rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate, On earth is not his equal.\nDid we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing; Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God\u0026rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he; Lord Sabaoth is his name, from age to age the same, And He must win the battle.\nAnd though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us, We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us; The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him; His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure, One little word shall fell him.\nThat word above all earthly pow\u0026rsquo;rs, no thanks to them, abideth; The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth; Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also; The body they may kill: God\u0026rsquo;s truth abideth still, His kingdom is forever.\n(Martin Luther)`\n​\t\u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; ​\tdeclares the LORD of hosts, The Lord of hosts declares Israel to return, not merely to the land but to himself. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are back in the land, they have rebuilt the altar and laid the foundation for the temple. It's appears as though things are going well apart from the opposition from the Samaritans. Perhaps Zechariah's message should be rather, rebuild the temple no matter the obstacles, just get it done! Yet, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, they must first of all return to Him by faith. This, perhaps was totally overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances. SO, when a little trial comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, simple trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11 ​\t\u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; ​\tsays the LORD of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts with you. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God's presence among the people. Haggai's prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. Here God is telling Israel to return to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart back to the Lord of Hosts. ​\t\u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, 2 Chr 30:7 ​\tto whom the former prophets proclaimed, ​\tsaying, ​\t\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways ​\tand from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; ​\tBut they did not listen ​\tor give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; ​\tdeclares the LORD. ​\t\u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? The fathers had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. ​ And the prophets, ​ do they live forever? Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to. ​ \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, ​ which I commanded My servants ​ the prophets, ​ overtake your fathers? Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still sends more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God's commands are still the same, even today ​ Then they repented and said, the word for repent (SHUB) is better translated here returned as it's referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. ​ As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us ​ in accordance with our ways ​ and our deeds, ​ so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Scripture states that 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers (Ezra 2:64–65), including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. (Ezra 2:70). Though these returned physically, overall, they did not turn to God. Jer 7:4 \u0026quot;Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.' Jer 7:8\nA NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible is used in different ways and it has caused a lot of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original metanoia (change your mind). We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them. This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it first is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be right with God. Israel needed to come to God by faith, not merely saying they did wrong and accepting God's punishment.\nThe purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him. Isa 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, \u0026quot;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned *by rote,* Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.\u0026quot; Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are *done* in a dark place, And they say, \u0026quot;Who sees us?\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Who knows us?\u0026quot; You turn *things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, \u0026quot;He did not make me\u0026quot;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, \u0026quot;He has no understanding\u0026quot;?\nGod wanted this generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith.\n\u0026quot;Return to me and I will return to you\u0026quot; - God\n“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”. (James 4:8 nkjv) Message #2 - Eight Visions# On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, There are no Hebrew names given for months. Moses gave the law to the second generation on the first day of the 11th month. Deut 1:3 which is the month Shebat, Shebat is the aquired Babylonian name for the eleventh month. This is the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel. in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, this is three months after receiving the first message. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight visions in one night.\nThe man on the Red Horse# as follows: ​\tI saw at night, Zechariah received this message in a vision at night. This was not a dream. He literally saw these things and describes what he saw in terms he and his audience understood. ​\tand behold, ​\ta man was riding later we will see that this man, also called the Angel of the Lord is none other than Christ himself. ​\ton a red horse, generally speaking red symbolizes blood as a result of war. This rider may have been riding in battle. Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. This man is none other than Jesus Christ. Revelation 6:4, Rev 19:19-21 ​\tand he was standing ​\tamong the myrtle trees The rider on the red horse was riding but is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is no longer riding but standing under the shade of myrtle trees. Nehemiah 8:15 implies that myrtle trees possibly grew in or near Jerusalem. They are certainly all through modern Palestine. MOst pictures of myrtle trees show it as a shrub about 8-10 feet tall but given the right conditions and with plenty of water, it grows to a considerable size. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther\u0026rsquo;s Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 The pomegranate is also in the myrtle family\n​\twhich were in the ravine, Jer 7:30-34 \u0026quot;For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight,\u0026quot; declares the LORD, \u0026quot;they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. \u0026quot;They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind. \u0026quot;Therefore, behold, days are coming,\u0026quot; declares the LORD, \u0026quot;when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place. \u0026quot;The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.\u0026quot;Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin.Nehemiah, Isaiah and Zechariah mention myrtle trees. Nehemiah mentions myrtle branches during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths. Isaiah states that during the milenial reign when everything is restored, God will turn briars (result of man's sin) into myrtle trees. Isaiah 41:19, Isaiah 55:13, ​\twith red, ​\tsorrel ​\tand white ​\thorses behind him. Red, sorrel and white horses behind him ​\tThen I said, ​\t\u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; ​\tAnd the angel ​\twho was speaking with me ​\tsaid to me, ​\t\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; not who but what ​\tAnd the man ​\twho was standing ​\tamong the myrtle trees ​\tanswered and said, the man on the red horse himself explains... ​\t\u0026ldquo;These are those ​\twhom the LORD has sent ​\tto patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; It is difficult to pinpoint when this ocurrs. We know from Job 1:6-7 that Satan also roams to and fro over the earth. This angel patrol seems to be roaming over the earth.Zech 6:7, ​\tSo they answered the angel of the LORD ​\twho was standing ​\tamong the myrtle trees ​\tand said, ​\t\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, ​\tand behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo;\n​\tThe LORD answered the angel ​\twho was speaking with me ​\twith gracious words, ​\tcomforting words. ​\tSo the angel ​\twho was speaking with me ​\tsaid to me, ​\t\u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, ​\t\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous ​\tfor Jerusalem and Zion. ​\t\u0026ldquo;But I am very angry ​\twith the nations ​\twho are at ease; ​\tfor while I was only a little angry, ​\tthey furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo;\npeace is a good thing but not at the cost of injustice. Israel is not in her land, she has been disbursed. Here the angel of the Lord is calling out for justice.\n​\t\u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, ​\t\u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem ​\twith compassion; ​\tMy house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; ​\tdeclares the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;and a measuring line ​\twill be stretched ​\tover Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; ​\t\u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, ​\t\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow ​\twith prosperity, ​\tand the LORD will again ​\tcomfort Zion ​\tand again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nFour Horns \u0026amp; Four Craftsmen# Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nJoshua the high priest and his friends# Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Now Joshua was clothed\twith filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you— indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nA Lampstand of gold# Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo; Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12). His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge. \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel— these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nA Flying Scroll# Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nEphah going forth# Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nTwo Women# Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nFour Chariots# Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nMessage #3 -# In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.\n\u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days, \u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nIV Message #4 - The Two Burdens# Burden #1 - The First Coming# The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain— The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nBurden #2 - The Second Coming# The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.\nThen the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.\nNow this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.\nSo also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.\nThen it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=========================\nZechariah# possible: Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah to the Nations (Phrased + Indented + Comments)\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said, \u0026quot;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026quot; The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026quot;Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026quot;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026quot; 'Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026quot;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026quot; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026quot;' \u0026quot;Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026quot;'\u0026quot; Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, \u0026quot;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026quot; Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026quot;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026quot; Again he said to him, \u0026quot;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026quot; Then I said, \u0026quot;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026quot; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026quot;Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing *here.* 'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you— indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. 'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to *sit* under *his* vine and under *his* fig tree.'\u0026quot; Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel— these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.\n\u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days, \u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain— The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nBehold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.\nThen the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea;\nZechariah 14:8-11 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. (9) And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one... People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Isaiah 11:9-10 They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea. (10) Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious. Isaiah 60:18-20 No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. (19) The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. (20) Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.\n​\tit will be in summer ​\tas well as in winter. what does this mean? does it happen in summer and winter simultaneously? Probably not since Jerusalem is the center? This is probably referring to the amount of time...lingering on from summer and going into the winter. ​\tAnd the LORD will be king ​\tover all the earth; ​\tin that day ​\tthe LORD will be the only one, ​\tand His name the only one. ​\tAll the land will be changed ​\tinto a plain ​\tfrom Geba ​\tto Rimmon ​\tsouth of Jerusalem; ​\tbut Jerusalem will rise ​\tand remain on its site ​\tfrom Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate ​\tas far as the place ​\tof the First Gate ​\tto the Corner Gate, ​\tand from the Tower of Hananel ​\tto the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. ​\tPeople will live in it, ​\tand there will no longer be a curse, ​\tfor Jerusalem will dwell in security.\nNow this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; against those who have gone against Jerusalem and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.\nSo also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.\nThen it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. When God gave the law, he commanded that Israel should live in tents or booths during the feast on the seventh month (Tishri). Nehemiah 8:14 For seven days, starting the fifteenth day of the seventh month Israel was to have a feast. During this time, they were to dwell in tents or booths. Leviticus 23:16, 34 This was a feast of celebration after the harvest was gathered. Deuteronomy 16:13 This feast is mentioned in Zechariah 3 times and only near the end of chapter 14. Zechariah 14:16, 18-19 The feast of booths/tabernacles was celebrated after the harvest. During the Millenial reign of Christ, not only will Israel but all of the nations will come to celebrate the great havest of souls. This may be the connection with the 70 bulls that were sacrificed and symbolized the 70 Gentiles nations of Genesis 10. Numbers 29:12-34\nIn that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day. \u0026lsquo;What a strange last statement to make before finishing up the fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promises. Surely this had to be hopeful news, but why? Why are the Canaanites singled out?\n===========================\nZechariah# (Chronology + Conversation)\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nSo they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said,\n\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said,\n\u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo;\nThe LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he answered me,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him,\n\u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan,\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo;\nSo they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;\nSo the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nAlso the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to him,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I answered,\n\u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;\nI said,\n\u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.\nI said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.\nThen I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;\nThe angel replied to me,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.\nThen He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo;\nThe word of the LORD also came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026quot; Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificialbasin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemyin the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.\nThen the LORD said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\nThe LORD said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,\n\u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=========================\n========================\nZechariah# (Chronology + Conversation)\nZACARíAS 1.

Milenial (Eze 40-48) - Zech. 6:12\nMessage #1 - God says, \u0026ldquo;Return to ME!\u0026rdquo;\n- *(Year 2, month 8 of Darius)*\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, 520BC. dates are given based on the ruling gentile king. There is no king of Israel or Judah at this time. Zerubbabel is governor. The line of David is off the throne, and the Times of the Gentiles are in progress. (Luke 21:24, Rom 11:25). The eighth month was called Bul (1 Kings 6:38) but after exile evidently Marcheshvan - \u0026quot;rainy\u0026quot; (Josephus).\nthe word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, “The second year of Darius” is the same year in which Haggai prophesied. Haggai was given a prophecy in September (to begin rebuilding temple), October (Hag 2), and December, but none in November. So this man Zechariah was given a prophecy in November, the month Haggai missed. Two months before this message, they had began to rebuild the temple. One month before, they were discouraged. Haggai gave them an encouraging message of hope (Hag 2). - Zechariah is mentioned as head of the family (Neh 12:4++). This means in 520 Zechariah was probably a young man. Zechariah was a prophet - this was his rank.\nthe son of Berechiah, (Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - Yahweh blesses\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Berechiah, the __fa__ther of Zechariah.\na. Jesus menciona a un profeta martirizado llamado Zaracías hijo de Berequías en Mat 23:35. Lucas no lo menciona. Luc 11:51, 2 Cró 24:20-22. Es dificil saber con certeza.# i. Opción 1: Berequias significa lo mismo que Jehoiada.# ii. Opción 2: Berequías era el padre mientras que Jehoiada era su abuelo.# iii. Opción 3: Jesus era testigo del asesinato de Zacarías al igual que Abel.# - Matthew was familiar with Zechariah. In fact he quotes it three times. The fact that Jesus mentions Zechariah of Berechiah as a martyr would have surprised Matthew and therefore he noted it. Zechariah 9:9, 11:13, 13:7# iv. Option 4: Error in transcription\u0026rsquo;# the son of Iddo saying, (Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - grandfather of Zechariah. One of the priests/levites who returned from Babylon (Neh 12:4, Neh 12:16)\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026quot; 70 years exile is proof. Zechariah makes it clear, the reason they were in captivity was because they had displeased the Lord.\nTherefore say to them,\n\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, LORD of hosts - 52x in Zechariah. The way it is used it “implies the boundless resources at His command for His people's good\u0026quot;- fausset. He is rich in mercy (Eph 2:4). He is rich in power (Matt 28:18). This is some false prophet. This is a message from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to the importance of the message. APP: What does God have to say about this/that? \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, invitation to a spiritual return at the time of a physical return. In the midst of physical returning, God invites Judah into a relationship, not religious rote.\n\u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. This is clearly Zechariah emphasizing God's continual offer of forgiveness. The Lord of hosts would return to be theirs upon their return to HIM, not to the land! Q: were the people thinking all was well because they were back in the land? Once they rebuilt the temple, would they think God had returned to them? Was their religion what God looked for?\n\u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, former prophets: Hosea. Joel. Amos. Isaiah. Jeremiah. This is important to the message of Zechariah - God spoke to the people through the prophets of old. The people did not listen, therefore they were wrong and God was angered. They were exiled. Zechariah is appealing to the people...look what happened when God (through the prophets of old) was not listened to. Now listen to God as He speaks through me.\n\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, It's not Zechariah's word, it's the Lord of host\n\u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; This can be better understood in the light of what Haggai says in Hag 2:10-14. Two ways to understand men of old: through the lens of religion and the dogmas they enforced and try to replicate the formula to produce the same results. The other lens is to understand what God was doing at a specific time through failed people and simple learn from the past within it's specific time. How can that apply to us today? The latter is the correct lens.\nBut they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.\n\u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026quot; The fathers were dead. The prophets were dead and their message died with them. Did God keep speaking the same message (through the same prophets) forever? NO! God was patient but not passive. But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? The anticipated answer is, YES!\nThen they repented and said, they repented: (SHUB - return) this is not the same meaning as METANOIA in NT. This means simply to return. Religious or otherwise. It is often assumed SHUB is the same as METANOIA. They are not. Acts 26:20 shows METANOIA is not return.\n\u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 23:20 **\u0026quot;The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.** Mal 3:7\u0026quot;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,\u0026quot; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026quot;But you say, 'How shall we return?'\nSUMMARY NOTE: Were Haggai and Zechariah effective? Did the people listen? Ezra says thanks to them the temple was rebuilt: \u0026quot;Ezr 6:14 And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\u0026quot; Message #2 - Zechariah received a series of visions\n- *(Year 2, month 11 [Shebat] of Darius)* In a series of eight night visions, God explains His involvement with His people.\nVision Meaning 1 Horsemen (1:7-17): Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt. The nations watched (near fulfillment) 2 Horns and craftsmen (1:18-21): The four empires will be terrified by four craftsmen (near) 3 Measuring Line (2:1-13): Jerusalem measured=restored (near) 4 High Priest (3:1-10): Judah rejects God, yet ultimately God will restore them (near) 5 Olive Trees (4:1-14): God empowers his people through His Spirit (near) 6 The Flying Scroll (5:1-4): (far) 7 The Ephah (5:5-11): (far) 8 Four Chariots (6:1-15): Gentiles judged / Christ\u0026rsquo;s reign (far) Vision #1 - The Horseman\nGod watches the nations. God will rebuild Jerusalem and the temple\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,\nwhich is the month Shebat, the month is named this time. Is there a reason?\nin the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:\nI saw at night, a vision at night\nand behold, a man was riding on a red horse, No explanation is given as tot he colours of the horses. a red horse, is it death, war?\nand he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, Myrtle trees are seen as blessing from God in Isaiah 55:1-13. God will turn briars into myrtle trees. The fact that this rider is standing among myrtle trees in the ravine speaks of blessing.\nwith red, sorrel and white horses behind him. red horse, sorrel (brown), white horses\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; An angel was also there\nAnd the angel who was speaking with me said to me, This angel is similar to Gabriel who came to explain the meaning of the visions\n\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; The interpreting angel says, \u0026quot;i will show you. I will explain to you\u0026quot;\nAnd the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, now the man on the red horse speaks\n\u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; Are there always those patroling the earth? Is this a one-time event?\nSo they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, they? The red horse and white horses? Angel of the Lord, man on the red horse, man standing among the myrtle trees. Same person?\nTHE ANGEL OF THE LORD: (6x in Zechariah). This “man among the myrtle trees” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times made temporary preincarnate appearances on earth. As the Angel of the Lord, the Son of God appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), Abraham (18; 22:11–18), Jacob (31:11, 13), Moses (Ex. 3), Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23), Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).\n\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; These horsemen answer to the angel of the Lord. When is the earth peaceful and quiet? In relation to what? Evidently in relation to the defense/prosperity of Jerusalem. The nations were at ease.This is wrong since the Jews are not in the land. Then the angel of the LORD said,\n\u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; The Angel of the Lord answers to God the Father. In this case he intercedes for the people...\u0026quot;how long?\u0026quot;. The events of the vision take place after the 70 years in exile. The expectation is the reconquering (compassion) of the land. For centuries, “How long?” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Ps. 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “How long?” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven (Rev. 6:10). That the Son of God should so identify Himself with the cries of His people reveals His compassion and concern. “In all their distress he too was distressed” (Isa. 63:9 niv).- wiersbe\nThe LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.Zechariah makes mention of the mercy in the Lord's words. This is the nature of all prophecy. IT is to bring hope and comfort to the reader.\nSo the angel who was speaking with me said to me, this is the interpreting angel. \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, this was to be what Zechariah was to tell the people. \u0026quot;NOTICE: proclaim...the message God gave him\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. Jerusalem and Zion are distinguished here. Possibly the city vs the holy mountain Psa 2:6, Isa 10:32, Mic 3:12, Mic 4:1-2\n\u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; The Lord said this would happen and had even promised to punish the Chaldeans for their harsh treatment of the Jews. HAB 2:8\n\u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD,\n\u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; what is a measuring line? You can't measure something that isn't there. My house (temple #2) will be built. Zechariah 4:10 \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, especially Jerusalem\nVision #2 - Four Horns\nGod concerns himself with the four gentile nations who have risen against Israel and Judah\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, horns are generally empires or powers\n\u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he answered me,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; four horns, IF ISRAEL and if this deals with the period up to that time, then (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Medo-Persia?). If 4 horns of Daniel and after 70x7 then it deals with the 4 horns from the times of the Gentiles starting with Babylon. A key interpretive phrase is \u0026quot;have scattered...\u0026quot;Does this deal with Zechariah's past or from Zechariah's vision's past? Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, Zechariah was shown 4 craftsmen. What are craftsmen? 1. Blacksmiths 2. Carpenters 3. Masons 4. Warriors 5. Jewelers. 2 Kings 22:6 distinguishes craftsmen from masons. 2 kings 24:16 mentions \u0026quot;1000 craftsmen...strong and fit for war\u0026quot;. 2 Chr 24:12 mentions craftsmen who were hired to rebuild the temple. Isa 40:19-20 connects craftsmen to idol makers. Isa 54:16 God makes the smith (craftsmen) to form the weapons out of iron. Nebuchadnezzar took all the crafstmen to Babylon. Eze 21:31 seems to refer to craftsmen as leaders, brutal men skilled in destruction. It does appear at first glance that God wants Zechariah to know the four horns are dealt with so as to not be discouraged.\n\u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; It is good when Zechariah asks questions for us becuase he generally gets an answer. He asks not who are they but what are they coming to do, so Zechariah's curiosity is in regards to their purpose. If 70 years then these 4 craftsmen already came. If 70x7 then the 4 craftsmen could be during the tribulation? And he said, the interpreting angel\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; four craftsmen? What they're doing is answered: To terrify the four horns...to throw them down. Evidently their identity is not important. Their purpose and is.Psa 75:10\nVision #3 - The Man Measuring the Temple\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. Similar scene to Rev 11 except this is in referince to the city not the temple. So I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Not what are you doing, but where are you going? The man seems to be walking away somewhere not evident to Zechariah, perhaps because at the time there was no city to speak of, it was in ruins.\nAnd he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; not measuring the temple as Rev 11 but Jersusalem. What was the state of Jerusalem at the time?\u0026quot;\nAnd behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, what angel is going to measure with the man? Where is the angel 'coming out' from? Coming out from the city? A note about the status of Jerusalem at this point in history: Jerusalem was destoyed: Jeremiah 26;18, 2 Chro 36:17-21, Eze 33:21 Jerusalem will be rebuilt: Temple will be rebuilt within 4 years (by the sixth year of king Darius): Ezra 6:14-15 under Zerubbabel: 2 Chr 36:22-23, Zechariah 4:9\nJerusalem walls rebuilt: Neh 2:3, Neh 2:17\n\u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, Zechariah is refered to as young man by the new angel.\n\u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; The Lord will cause Jerusalem to be rebuilt (inhabited).2 Chr 36:22-23, Neh 2\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. Genesis 12\n\u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them THE NATIONS will feel the wave of the hand of God over them\nso that they will be plunder for their slaves. Calamity due to their slaves - the jews.\nThen you Judah\nwill know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. Is Jesus speaking? It's no doubt when it happens. God did it. They would know it.\n\u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Emanuel? God with us? John 1:14, Mat 4:13-17. This is true of the first coming but ultimately fullfiled in the second coming. As we see following... \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. At first glance this could be refering to Jesus' first coming but it says (after the nations join), then I will dwell...this must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst. In that day...\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, your kingdom come.\n\u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; Isa 62:1-4\nVision #4 - Joshua the High Priest\nJoshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35 Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when \u0026quot;the Branch\u0026quot; rules\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan,\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! the Lord said Satan. This must be Jesus rebuking Satan\nIndeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan is not after Joshua, but who Joshua represents - Israel\nIs this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments?\n\u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's.\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the obvious next step, \u0026quot;don't forget the turban!!\u0026quot;. Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on...\nSo they who, the angels?\nput a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. Notice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here...\u0026quot;IF you will walk...then you will govern my house\u0026quot;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.\n\u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, \u0026quot;your friends\u0026quot; in other words, religious leaders - these the priests, pharisees, saducees?\nfor behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jer 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13\n\u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. THis addition is very interesting...\u0026quot;before Joshua\u0026quot; the stone. The cornerstone. The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6\nBehold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, inscription on the rock?\n\u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy\ndeclares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Hab 3:17\nVision #5 - The Lampstand\nThen the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to state was he saw.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks\nand its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Ex 25:37\nalso two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;\nSo the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained\n\u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, a specific message to Zerubbabel...\n\u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026quot;ease does not produce strength\u0026quot;. Grace is what teaches us (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are to be strenghtened by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2)\n\u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!\nVision #6 - Two Annointed Ones\nAlso the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—a plumb line is used for building. these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6\nThen I said to him,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; First he asks what are the olive TREES\nAnd I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; Now he asks what are the olive BRANCHES. the two witnesses from Revelation?\nSo he answered me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I answered,\n\u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5?\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; tribulation?\nsurely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.\n\u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; the justice of God - he will make it go forth.\nand it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo; total consumption\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;\nI said,\n\u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; is this the harlot Babylon?\nAnd he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. Rev 17-18?\nVision #7 - Two Winged Women serve \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; to build a temple in Shinar\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.\nI said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her the harlot Babylon\nin the land of Shinar; a return to Babel\nand when it is parepared, The temple\nshe will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo; a temple will be built in Babylon\nVision #8 - Four Chariots\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; the two mountains?\nand the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Very similar to the 4 horsemen in Revelation\nThen I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; not where or who but what. Later we are told these respond to the angel of the Lord. Are they angels sent to patrol and appear to Zech as chariots? The angel replied to me, not the angel of the Lord, but the interpreting angel\n\u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,\nwith one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; drought? Famine?\nand the white ones go forth after them, false conquest? Antichrist?\nwhile the dappled ones go forth to the south country. ``\n\u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.\nThen He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; does this imply repentance or justice served?\nThe word of the LORD also came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.\n\u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026quot; why would the high priest wear the crown?\nThen say to him,\n\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nMessage #3\n*(year 4, month 9 [Chislev] of Darius)*\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.\nNow the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?\n\u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.\n\u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint\nso that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets;\ntherefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts;\n\u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known.\nThus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD,\n\u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.

Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.\nAshkelon will see it and be afraid.\nGaza too will writhe in great pain;\nAlso Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.\nAnd a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth.\nThen they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.\nBut I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.\nRejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you;\nHe is just and endowed with salvation,\nHumble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\nI will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem;\nAnd the bow of war will be cut off.\nAnd He will speak peace to the nations;\nAnd His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.\nAs for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.\nReturn to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword.\nThen the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar.\nAnd the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain.\nTherefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.\n\u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.\n\u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone,\nFrom them the tent peg,\nFrom them the bow of battle,\nFrom them every ruler, all of them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.\n\u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.\n\u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026quot;\nWhen I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026quot;\nI will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo;\nAnd their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026quot;\nbut behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.\nAnd I took for myself two staffs:\nthe one I called Favor and\nthe other I called Union;\nso I pastured the flock.\nThen I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.\nThen I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you.

But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nIn that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026quot;\nIn that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026quot;\nAnd in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026quot;\nIn that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026quot;\nIn that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026quot;\nIt will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026quot;\nAlso it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.\nIn that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!\nIn that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.\nAnd in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth;\nin that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.\nIt will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.\nIn that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.\nAnd there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\nZechariah - background\nTitle: Zekar-yah = God remembers On December 18, 520 BC, Zechariah began his ministry.

General Information\nAuthor: Zechariah. Was a levite who was born in Babylon (Neh 12:1, 16). He was the son of Berekiah and the grandson of Iddo the priest (Zechariah 1:1 ; cf. 12:4, 16; Ezra 5:1; 6:14 ), therefore, although the name was a common one, it is possible that he was a priest. Zechariah was a prophet. Zechariah was probably young (Zechariah 2:4). He is also stated as the head of the family (Neh 6:14) at 520BC which at the time of the writing makes him a young man.

Zechariah 1:1 In the eighth month of the second year of Darius\u0026hellip; This king is not the Darius the Mede we meet during Daniel\u0026rsquo;s time (538-536 BC). This king, Darius I, is a successor to Cyrus the Persian. He ruled from 522-486 BC. Ezra 4-6# 1. The year is 520 BC. Medo-Persia is in power. Zerubbabel has been placed as governor over Judah.# 2. Some dates to help understand where we are in Israel\u0026rsquo;s history.# 1. 722 BC - The Assyrians conquer Israel# 2. 700 BC - Isaiah prophesied that a king named Cyrus would be instrumental in returning the people and rebuilding Jerusalem. Isa 44:28, Isa 45:13# 3. 605 BC - The EXILE begins. The Babylonians conquer Judah.# 4. 586 BC - The temple is destroyed# 5. 538 BC - Cyrus makes a decree to set the exiles free and to return to rebuild the temple. Ezra 1:1-4, 6:3# 6. 536 BC - The foundation for the temple begins# i. After the foundation for the temple was laid, the Samaritans began to make trouble to discourage any rebuilding. Ezr 4:1-6:28,# ii. The Samaritan woman and Jesus have a conversation surrounding this issue many centuries later. John 4:19-24# 7. 520 BC - Darius I reaffirmed Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s decree yet the temple remained in ruins. Ezra 6:1-12, Hag 1:4# a. The rebuilding of the temple begins. Haggai and Zechariah begin their ministry.# 8. 516 BC - the Temple is finished# 9. 457 BC - Artaxerxes I issued a decree to Ezra, giving autonomy to Judah., Ezr 7:12-26# 10. 444 BC - Artaxerxes I issued a decree to Nehemiah to rebuild Jersualem. Neh 2:1-8# a. The times of the gentiles is set in progress. , Dan 9:24-27, Luk 21:24, Rom 11:25# 3. Haggai began prophecying on this same year as well.# a. Due to setbacks caused by the Samarians, about 17 years had passed since Cyrus\u0026rsquo;s decree to return to the land and restore the temple. The temple remains in ruins. Ezr 4-6# Zechariah 1:1b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,# 1. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction. It was God\u0026rsquo;s word. Heb 1:1, 2 Tim 3:16-17# 2. Haggai prophesied in September, October and December but nothing in November. Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy was in November.# 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what God commanded. Ezra 5:2# 4. Even though there was opposition, God told the people to begin rebuilding the temple. The opposition remained quiet until hearing back from king Darius I regarding the authenticity of the decree issued by Cyrus. Ezra 5:5# Zechariah 1:1c the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, Zech 1:1, Zech 1:7# Not much is told to us about Berechiah except he was the father of Zechariah.# Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called Zechariah son of Berechiah in Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions this but leaves Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s name out. Luk 11:51# It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to know why it is stated this way in Matthew since we don\u0026rsquo;t know how Zechariah dies and there is another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who was a prophet that had lived 300 years earlier that was killed by the people. 2 Chr. 24:20-22# Option 1: Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. Since they mean the same, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus# Option 2: Both Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s may have had fathers named Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather.# Option 3: Error in transcription# Option 4: Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s. This seems the most plausible option of the 4.# Matthew was also familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would have caught his attention to hear Jesus state it.# Iddo, was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. He was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Neh 12:1-4# En 520 B.C. Zechariah is probably a young man. Zac 2:4# Zechariah was a prophet. This was his roll.# Zechariah 1:2 \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. Having been exiled for 70 years is proof of this. 2 Chr 36# Zechariah 1:3 \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,# Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo; word to the people, this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua.# 2. \u0026ldquo;The Lord of hosts\u0026rdquo; appears no less than 52 times in Zecharias. The way this title of God is used implies the unlimited resources available at his disposition for his people. Hosts is that which goes forth, army, war, warfare. A host is a mass of persons organized usually for battle. The usage of this title implies that God is He who goes before and battles.# David understood that it was God who fought for them against their enemies when he went before Goliath in the name of the Lord of hosts. 1 Sam 17:45-46# New Testament Connection:# Romans 9:29 - \u0026ldquo;And just as Isaiah foretold, \u0026ldquo;UNLESS THE LORD OF SABAOTH HAD LEFT TO US A POSTERITY, WE WOULD HAVE BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND WOULD HAVE RESEMBLED GOMORRAH.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; The Lord of Sabaoth here is the same Lord of hosts. It was the Lord of hosts that kept them from the same fate as Sodom and Gomorrah\u0026rsquo;s. Isa 1:9# James 4:5 - \u0026ldquo;Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, and which has been withheld by you, cries out against you; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.\u0026rdquo; James reminds the church age believer with Hebrew roots about how the Lord of hosts had told them to act fairly with everyone and trust God for His provision. Mal 3:5, Zech 7:8-10# Eventually Christ, when He reigns on the earth will take on the name Lord of hosts. Zech 14:16-17# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message comes from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to see the importance of his message. Thankfully governor Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest didn\u0026rsquo;t question the source of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message. Ultimately the temple will be rebuilt under Zerubbabel.# Zechariah 1:3 \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts.# The opposite of return is to forsake. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and needed to return. The result would be God\u0026rsquo;s returning to them as the Lord of hosts to defend and fight for His nation.# Zechariah 1:4a \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo; They could see their evil ways and God knew their hearts were far removed. Rev 2:1-7# Evil ways and evil deeds are demonstrable yet a return to God is not merely about ceasing to do evil things but a return to fellowship.# A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external).# Zechariah 1:4b \u0026ldquo;But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. The previous generation did not listen to God, they did not change their minds and continued on even expecting the consequences. Zech 7:11-14# God invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zech 7:4-6, Zech 8:2, Amo 5:21-27, Col 2:23,# God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship. Isa 1:12-14, Jer 4:4# It is counted as violence to the law. Eze 22:26, Zep 3:4# In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.# An old commentator rephrased Paul\u0026rsquo;s words, I perceive that in all things yo are too superstitious. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23# Zechariah 1:5 \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? The great majority of that generation died while in exile. Most did not return. Psa 90:10# Zechariah 1:5b And the prophets, do they live forever? Now those prophets were gone, their message should have been heeded at the moment it was proclaimed. Delayed obedience is disobedience.# God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvatión is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jer 26:5, 2 Cor 6:2# Zechariah 1:6 \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? \u0026hellip;God had made it abundantly known and clear to everyone. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have an excuse.# Zechariah 1:6b Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us...the term repented is a bit confusing here.# The word SHUB \u0026ldquo;repented\u0026rdquo; could also be translated as \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; (KJV). Compare the use of SHUB in Zec 1:3 with Zec 1:6# If we are to think they repented, then they are being referred to in a positive light. Yet the whole argument to the admonition hinges on the fact that the previous generation did not do what was right.# The purpose then must be to show the previous generation had returned, accepting their fate as from God for doing wrong but were still not trusting God. This present generation should not take that approach with God, but rather repent.# The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of thinking, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said. Eze 20:43# A short note about biblical repentance:# It\u0026rsquo;s not merely recognizing the wrong you have done. It\u0026rsquo;s not a focus on the admission of guilt. Mat 27:3-5# It\u0026rsquo;s not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words.# It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Rom 2:4, 2 Cor 7:9# It\u0026rsquo;s not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.# It\u0026rsquo;s not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance. This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today. The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic. Luk 3:8-18,# Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God, you change your thinking regarding what you are trusting in to trust God. Act 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isa 1:18, Heb 6:1# F\tor instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luk 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luk 13:1-5# Or for a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Rev 2:21, Rev 3:3, Rev 3:19, 1 Jn 1:9, Rom 6:1-11, Rom 8:12-13, Gal 5:16# Conclusion of Message #1# God invited this generation to return to himself. It was an invitation to a relationship of trust and dependance in God. The previous generation had disobeyed God. They returned physically to the land, they even recognized their error but never changed their minds and placed their faith in God alone. Returning to God is an act of faith (changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God) not by external works (ie returning to the land, rebuilding the temple).\nZechariah 1:7-6:15 - Message #2 - Zechariah is given 8 visions that show a hopeful future of Israel, Jerusalem and the temple.# Zechariah received 8 visions in one night. All 8 visions for the most part follow a similar pattern.# 1. Introduction 2. An explanation of what was seen 3. A request for clarification 4. The meaning of the vision Vision Meaning 1 Horseman (1:7-17): Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt. The nations watched 2 Horns and craftsmen (1:18-21): The four empires will be terrified by four craftsmen 3 Measuring Jerusalem (2:1-13): Jerusalem measured=restored 4 High Priest (3:1-10): Judah rejects God, yet ultimately God will restore them 5 Olive Trees (4:1-14): God empowers his people through His Spirit 6 The Flying Scroll (5:1-4): 7 The Ephah (5:5-11): 8 Four Chariots (6:1-15): Gentiles judged / Christ\u0026rsquo;s reign Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the rider among the myrtle trees# Zechariah 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, \u0026hellip;three months after receiving the first message, Zechariah receives another message from the Lord in the form of 8 visions in one night. Zech 1:1# Zechariah 1:7b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: God spoke again to Zechariah and it happened like this\u0026hellip;# Once again Zechariah gives his ancestry. Zechariah was from a priestly line serving as a prophet. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was later compiled together to form all of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecies.# Zechariah 1:8a I saw at night\u0026hellip; This is not a dream, it is a vision, he received while awake at night. Visions were received while awake and dreams are revelations while asleep. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Num 12:6# Zechariah 1:8b and behold, a man was riding on a red horse\u0026hellip; The first thing Zechariah saw was a man on a red horse. In verse 11 we are told this man is the angel of the Lord.# Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in contexts dealing with war.# The color red is often associated with blood and or war.# Here we see the angel of the Lord is ready to make war while in Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.# Zechariah 1:8b and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, Interestingly, myrtle trees are mentioned in other passages when God says he will turn the wilderness to blossom. Isa 41:19# In the fulfillment of the eternal covenant or New Covenant to Israel, God will turn briars into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isa 55:13# Zechariah 1:8c with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.# There are horses and chariots mentioned in Zechariah 6:2-7. Some believe these are related but many differences exist.# The number of horse colours in chapter 1 are three while in chapter 6 there are four.# Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know the meaning of the vision.# Zechariah 1:9b And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor\u0026rsquo;s task to interpret some mysterious dream. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Rev 1:1# Zechariah 1:10a And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, Zechariah hears the rider himself, the Angel of the Lord speaks.# Zechariah 1:10b \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; Satan is the prince of the air and has been given authority over the earth but that does not mean God is not in control and watching all things. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him.# Zechariah 1:11a So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees The agents report back to the angel of the Lord of they observe among the nations.# The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 6 times in Zechariah. This “man among the myrtle trees” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), Many scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth.# The angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), Abraham (18; 22:11–18), Jacob (31:11, 13), Moses (Ex. 3), Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23) and Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).# Zechariah 1:11b and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026ldquo;Peace! All is well!\u0026rdquo;. The response by the angel of the Lord reflects things are far from right in order to be at peace.# There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with peace as long as it is attained the right way. The nations were at peace at the expense of God\u0026rsquo;s nation Israel. God has no regard for man\u0026rsquo;s way of peace apart from Him.# True, ultimate world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from his throne in Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4# Peace does not come until Babylon is destroyed. Rev 17-18, Zech 5# Zechariah 1:12a Then the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts\u0026hellip; This is a conversation between the angel of the Lord and the Lord of hosts.# Zechariah 1:12b *how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah\u0026hellip;*The angel of the Lord requests the Lord of hosts for compassion.# For centuries, “How long?” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Psa 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2).# “How long?” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven. Rev. 6:10# Zechariah 1:12c \u0026hellip;with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, \u0026ldquo;how much longer are your people to suffer?\u0026rdquo; Jer 29:10# The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 17 extra years had passed and still \u0026ldquo;the earth is peaceful and quiet\u0026rdquo; and no temple has been erected. Jer 29:10# The angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s words reflect his concern for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026ldquo;at peace\u0026rdquo;.# It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Act 1:7# It was told to Daniel that ultimately it would be 70 units of 7. This comes to a total of 490 years that yet have to be fulfilled in their purpose. Dan 9:24-27# Zechariah 1:13 The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the \u0026ldquo;accusation\u0026rdquo; and responds with kind words. Col 4:6# Zechariah 1:14a So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; This message is not to be kept hidden it is to be announced. As a prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Heb 1:1-2# This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zech 1:12# Zechariah 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous This is not to be kept a mystery. The Lord kindly responds \u0026ldquo;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!\u0026rdquo; God has a strong devotion towards Israel. Isa 54:8, Heb 12:6-7# This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel.# Zechariah 1:14c for Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture we see how Zion is synonimous with Jerusalem. Yet here they shown distinct.# Zion is the mountain on which Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psa 2:6# Zion is the mountain on which God\u0026rsquo;s house, the temple, stands. Mic 3:12# Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Mic 4:1, 3# Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Mic 4:2# Zechariah 1:15 \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; The Lord had said this would happen and had even promised to punish them (specifically in this case the Chaldeans) for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1# Zechariah 1:16 \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort.# About 200 years earlier, God had announced through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this\u0026hellip;.\u0026ldquo;It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Isa 44:28# Zechariah adds to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10# Zechariah 1:17 \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The Lord of hosts (He who battles for them) is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zech 6:15# While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.# Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;you will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo; Ex 6:7# When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zech 13:9# When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Eze 36:11# When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Eze 36:23# When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Eze 36:36.# When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Eze 36:38.# When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Eze 37:6.# When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Eze 37:13# When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Eze 37:14# When God\u0026rsquo;s sanctuary will stand among them forever. Eze 37:28# When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Eze 38:23# When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Eze 39:28# Zechariah 1:18-21 The vision of the four horns and four craftsmen# Zechariah 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Horns used this way, typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. Psa 75:10, Dan 7-8, Rev 12-13, 17# Zechariah 1:19 So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; This does not seem to be referring to a future time. It speaks of four horns (gentile nations) that already had scattered Judah.# Option 1: The four horns had already come. Perhaps this refers to the four nations (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) mentioned in 2 Kings 24:2 that God used to scatter Judah.# Option 2: The four horns are not yet completed. Assyria is stated in one place as being the first to scatter, then Babylon and Medo Persia were guilty of this so the forth was yet to come, referring to Rome. Jer 50:17-18, Eze 34:11-24# Zechariah 1:19b *Judah, Israel and Jerusalem\u0026hellip;*Is the order given important? Judah, then Israel then Jerusalem\u0026hellip;it does not seem to change the interpretation since later only the scattering of Judah is mentioned. Zechariah 1:21# Zechariah 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen.# Craftsmen probably refers to a skilled worker in metal. Jer 29:2, Isa 44:11, Hos 13:2# Zechariah 1:21 I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; Even though the horns would scatter Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would terrify them and throw them down.# This served to encourage the reader that though things seemed helpless, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who would ultimately have the last word.# Zechariah 2:1-13 The vision of the measuring of Jerusalem# Zechariah 2:1a Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. Zechariah saw a man who had an instrument to measure in his hand.# Zechariah 2:2 So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; Zechariah was puzzled as to where the man was going. It may be that the actual city and it\u0026rsquo;s borders were unclear and was was actually there was a barren land since it had been demolished.# Zechariah 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel.# Zechariah 2:4 and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. God commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the angel to run!# Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.# Zechariah 2:5 \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; God himself says He will be the protecting wall around the city.# Zechariah 2:6 \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. This probably refers to Assyria.# Zechariah 2:7 \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.# The daughter of Babylon refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isa 47, Psa 137:8, Rev 17# This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Rev 17:5# Zechariah 2:8 For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches it, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deut 32:9-10# Zechariah 2:9 \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately shatter them like earthenware and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psa 2# Zechariah 2:10 \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Wow! Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon.# Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zech 9:9# Zechariah 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Clearly a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel\u0026rsquo;s rule.# About 20 References of \u0026ldquo;in that day\u0026rdquo; are found in Zechariah.# When God returns and comforts Jerusalem.# When God defends the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Zech 12:6# When God will destroy the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zech 12:3, 9# When God will remove all idolatry from the land. Zech 13:2# When Messiah stands on the mount of Olives. He will reign over all the earth from Zion. Zech 14:4, 9# Zechariah 2:11b Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ will one day dwell in their midst forever.# Zechariah 2:12 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present God has placed His program with them on hold. One day though, God will once again work directly in and through Israel. Rom 11:11-12, 25# Zechariah 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; God is angered at the current situation and laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple.# Zechariah 3:1-10 The vision of Joshua the high priest# Zechariah 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.# Zechariah 3:2 The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel.# Zechariah 3:4 He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 3:5 Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.# Zechariah 3:6 And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,# Zechariah 3:7 \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,# then you will also govern My house God gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Eze 44:15-16# Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27# and also have charge of My courts, The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests would be placed in charge of all the courts.# and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. # In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 2:5# Zechariah 3:8a \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.# Zechariah 3:8b you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends symbolize all the priests# Zechariah 3:8c for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant# Zechariah 3:9 \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.# Zechariah 3:10 \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:1-14 The vision of the two olive trees# Zechariah 4:1 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. Zechariah is roused to alertness. It\u0026rsquo;s important Zechariah get this down.# Zechariah 4:2 He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;# Zechariah 4:3 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:4 Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:6 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts.# Zechariah 4:7 \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:8 Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,# Zechariah 4:9 \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.# Zechariah 4:10 \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:11 Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:12 And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:13 So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:14 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:1-4 The vision of a flying scroll# Zechariah 5:1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll.# Zechariah 5:2 And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:3 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.# Zechariah 5:4 \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:5-11 The vision of the Ephah# Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:6 I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land# Zechariah 5:7 (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:8 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.# Zechariah 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.# Zechariah 5:10 I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:11 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 6:1-15 The vision of four chariots# Zechariah 6:1 Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.# Zechariah 6:2 With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses,# Zechariah 6:3 with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.# Zechariah 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 6:5 The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,# Zechariah 6:6 with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country.# Zechariah 6:7 \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.# Zechariah 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 6:9 The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,# Zechariah 6:10 \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.# Zechariah 6:11 \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.# Zechariah 6:12 \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD.# Zechariah 6:13 \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne.

Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.# Zechariah 10:3** ](verseid:38.10.3) \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.# Zechariah 10:4** ](verseid:38.10.4) \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together.# Zechariah 10:5** ](verseid:38.10.5) \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemyin the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.# Zechariah 10:6 \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.# Zechariah 10:7 \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.# Zechariah 10:8 \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before.# Zechariah 10:9 \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back.# Zechariah 10:10 \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them.# Zechariah 10:11 \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart.# Zechariah 10:12 \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# Zechariah 11:1 Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars.# Zechariah 11:2 Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down.# Zechariah 11:3 There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.# Zechariah 11:4 Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomedto slaughter.# Zechariah 11:5 \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them.# Zechariah 11:6 \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 11:7 So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock.# Zechariah 11:8 Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.# Zechariah 11:9 Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 11:10 I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.# Zechariah 11:11 So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.# Zechariah 11:12 I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.# Zechariah 11:13 Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, thatmagnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.# Zechariah 11:14 Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.# Zechariah 11:15 The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.# Zechariah 11:16 \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.# Zechariah 11:17 \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 12:1 The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,# Zechariah 12:2 \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.# Zechariah 12:3 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.# Zechariah 12:4 \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.# Zechariah 12:5 \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 12:6 \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:7 \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.# Zechariah 12:8 \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.# Zechariah 12:9 \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.# Zechariah 12:10 \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.# Zechariah 12:11 \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.# Zechariah 12:12 \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;# Zechariah 12:13 the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves;# Zechariah 12:14 all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.# Zechariah 13:1 \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.# Zechariah 13:2 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.# Zechariah 13:3 \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.# Zechariah 13:4 \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive;# Zechariah 13:5 but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 13:6 \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 13:7 \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones.# Zechariah 13:8 \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it.# Zechariah 13:9 \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested.

Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!# Zechariah 14:6 In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.# Zechariah 14:7 For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.# Zechariah 14:8 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.# Zechariah 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.# Zechariah 14:10 All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses.# Zechariah 14:11 People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.# Zechariah 14:12 Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.# Zechariah 14:13 It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.# Zechariah 14:14 Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.# Zechariah 14:15 So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.# Zechariah 14:16 Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.# Zechariah 14:17 And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.# Zechariah 14:18 If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.# Zechariah 14:19 This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.# Zechariah 14:20 In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar.# Zechariah 14:21 Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.# "},{

      "content":"Zechariah# possible title: Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah to the Nations# I. Zechariah - background# A. General Information# Title: Zekar-yah = God remembers\nOn December 18, 520 BC, Zechariah began his ministry. Zechariah 1:1\nZechariah is a post-exilic book\nPre-exilic - Habakkuk, Zephaniah Exilic- Daniel, Ezekiel Post-exilic - Zechariah, Haggai, Zechariah 1:1 – Zechariah, which means Yahweh remembers, prophesied at the same time as Haggai to encourage Israel to finish rebuilding the Temple.\nThe structure of the book can be remembered by the formula 8-4-2.\nZechariah 1-6 – Eight Visions Zechariah 7-8 – Four Messages Zechariah 9-14 – Two Burdens The New Testament quotes or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.\nZechariah (520-490 BC)\nAuthor: Zechariah. Was a levite who was born in Babylon (Neh 12:1, 16). He was the son of Berekiah and the grandson of Iddo the priest (Zechariah 1:1; cf. 12:4, 16; Ezra 5:1; 6:14](javascript:{})), therefore, although the name was a common one, it is possible that he was a priest.\nZechariah was a prophet.\nZechariah was probably young (Zechariah 2:4). He is also stated as the head of the family (Neh 6:14) at 520BC which at the time of the writing makes him a young man. Possibly his grandfather and father had since passed away.\nAudience: Returned Remnant\nPurpose: To encourage the returned remnant to rebuild the temple by focusing on the future hope of Messiah\nKey Term: The Messiah is Unveiled\nEasy division of the book\nMessage 1 - Chapter 1:1-6\nMessage 2 - Chapters 1-6 – Eight visions\nMessage 3 - Chapters 7-8 – Four Messages\nMessage 4 - Chapters 9-14 – Two Burdens\nPassages that you should know\nZechariah 1:3 – Return to the Lord!\nZechariah 1:8-14; 6:1-8 – Angelic patrols\nZechariah 14:9 – The Lord will be king over all the earth.\nKey Observations\nRemember the structure of the book by the formula 1-8-4-2.\nTo have a correct understanding of God’s prophetic program, we must understand the message of the Book of Zechariah.\nB. Grouping the Prophets# Option 1: Major (4) vs Minor (12)\nOption 2: Pre-exilic (before 586 BC), exilic (586-538 BC), post-exilic ()\nPre-exilic 1. North - pre 722 - Hosea, Amos, Jonah 2. South - Joel, Obadiah, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah Exilic 1. Ezekiel 2. Daniel Post-exilic 1. Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi C. Why study the book of Zechariah?# • It reveals behind the scenes Spiritual warfare\n• It reveals Israel\u0026rsquo;s future kingdom and the nations under it.\n• Because God remembers his promises (Meaning of Zechariah).\n• It is because of the prophecy of this book and teh book of Haggai that the temple was rebuilt. Ezra 4:5\nAfter 70 years God raised up a man named Cyrus to open the door to Juda\u0026rsquo;s return to the land (Ezra 1:2-4). This return happened in three waves. The first wave was led by a man named Zerubabel. This first return is the time at which the prophecy of Zechariah is given. Upon Juda\u0026rsquo;s return to Jerusalem they first rebuilt the altar of the Lord and reestablished sacrifices (Ezra 3:1-6). Also, the Temple was to be rebuilt with donations of material and money (Ezra 3:1–7) but up to the point where Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy begins, only the foundation has been laid (Ezra 3:8-13, 5:16). Opposition from the Samaritans has delayed the work about 18 years.\nII. Zechariah 1:1-6 - Message #1 - God\u0026rsquo;s call to return# Zechariah 1:1 In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,… Cyrus was the first Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, the persian succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the writing of Zechariah in 520 B.C.. # Most likely Scripture dates the writing of the book in reference to a Gentile king because Daniel's \u0026quot;times of the Gentiles\u0026quot; is now underway. No Jewish king is reigning. Jerusalem is being trampled underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24\nZechariah 1:1 the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,…* Zechariah is a young prophet. He never saw the first temple as he was a baby when he come from Babylon. Some scholars ascribe Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah.# 1. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction. It was God\u0026rsquo;s word. Heb 1:1, 2 Tim 3:16-17# 2. Haggai prophesied in September, October and December but nothing in November. Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy was in November.# 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what God commanded. Ezra 5:2# 4. Even though there was opposition, God told the people to begin rebuilding the temple. The opposition remained quiet until hearing back from king Darius I regarding the authenticity of the decree issued by Cyrus. Ezra 5:5# Zechariah 1:1 the son of Berechiah, …* evidently Zechariah's father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra.# not much is told to us about Berechiah except he was the father of Zechariah.# Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called Zechariah son of Berechiah in Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions this but leaves Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s name out. Luk 11:51# It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to know why it is stated this way in Matthew since we don\u0026rsquo;t know how Zechariah dies and there is another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who was a prophet that had lived 300 years earlier that was killed by the people. 2 Chr. 24:20-22# Option 1: Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. Since they mean the same, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus# Option 2: Both Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s may have had fathers named Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather.# Option 3: An error in transcription# Option 4: Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s. This seems the most plausible option of the 4.# Matthew was also familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would have caught his attention to hear Jesus state it.# Zechariah 1:1 the son of Iddo Iddo is Zechariah's grandfather. He is listed among the priests who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 4# Iddo, was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. He was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Neh 12:1-4# Zechariah was a prophet. This was his roll.# Zechariah 1:1 saying, \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chr 36# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, (the people who have returned)# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts\u0026rsquo; word to the people, this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua.# THE LORD OF HOSTS: # The LORD of Hosts is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. This is an important key to understanding Zechariah's message.# THE LORD OF HOST IS COMMANDER OF ARMIES# (Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of armies used 235 times in the Bible). # Tza-va (צבא) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the plural. Multiple armies of which are included the angelic beings.# Isaiah 13:4 A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16# Isaiah 19:16 ...they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts...You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any who are treacherous in iniquity. Selah. Isaiah 1:24, Isaiah 2:12, Isaiah 5:7 # Nahum 2:13 \u0026quot;Behold, I am against you,\u0026quot; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026quot;I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.\u0026quot; Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matt 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20# THE LORD OF HOSTS IS KING:# Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah# Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. # Zechariah 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.'# `1 Kings 22:19 Micaiah said, \u0026ldquo;Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many.# Isaiah 28:5 In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14# THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE REDEEMER:# Isaiah 47:4 Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel.# Isaiah 44:6 \u0026quot;Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me. Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5# Psalm 84:1-12 ....How blessed is the man who trusts in You!# THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HOLY: # Isaiah 6:3 \u0026quot;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.\u0026quot; Jeremiah 32:18 , Isaiah 8:14. Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16# THE LORD OF HOSTS IS SOVEREIGN: # \u0026quot;All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN \u0026amp; among the inhabitants of earth \u0026amp; no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, 'What have You done?\u0026quot; Daniel 4:35# Hannah is the first person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. 1 Samuel 1# David invokes the Lord of Hosts when going before Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10# David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27# WHAT ARE THE HOSTS?# `Genesis 2:1 mentions the hosts being created. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts.# Nehemiah 9:6 “You are the Lord, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host.” . and all the host them, of the heavens and the earth; the host of heavens are the sun, moon, and stars, often so called in Scripture, and also the angels; # ANGELS:# Luke 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16# A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing: For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe; His craft and pow\u0026rsquo;r are great, and, armed with cruel hate, On earth is not his equal.\nDid we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing; Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God\u0026rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he; Lord Sabaoth is his name, from age to age the same, And He must win the battle.\nAnd though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us, We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us; The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him; His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure, One little word shall fell him.\nThat word above all earthly pow\u0026rsquo;rs, no thanks to them, abideth; The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth; Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also; The body they may kill: God\u0026rsquo;s truth abideth still, His kingdom is forever.\n(Martin Luther)`\nEventually Christ, when He reigns on the earth will take on the name Lord of hosts. Zech 14:16-17# Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message comes from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to see the importance of his message. Thankfully governor Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest didn\u0026rsquo;t question the source of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message. Ultimately the temple will be rebuilt under Zerubbabel.# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; While Haggai is more focused on the return to the land and the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah's message is to encourage the people to return to a right relationship with God. In order to do so, God will reveal the person of Jesus Christ. The book of Zechariah will present Christ as: The angel of the Lord, The man, The Branch, The Shepherd, The king, The Redeemer, The humble Servant and finally, The Lord of Hosts.# The opposite of return is to forsake. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and needed to return. The result would be God\u0026rsquo;s returning to them as the Lord of hosts to defend and fight for His nation.\nZechariah 1:1 declares the LORD of hosts, The Lord of hosts declares Israel to return, not merely to the land but to himself. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are back in the land, they have rebuilt the altar and laid the foundation for the temple. It's appears as though things are going well apart from the opposition from the Samaritans. Perhaps Zechariah's message should be rather, rebuild the temple no matter the obstacles, just get it done! Yet, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, they must first of all return to Him by faith. This, perhaps was totally overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances. SO, when a little trial comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, simple trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 1:1 says the LORD of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts with you. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God's presence among the people. Haggai's prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. Here God is telling Israel to return to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart back to the Lord of Hosts.# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, 2 Chr 30:7# Zechariah 1:1 to whom the former prophets proclaimed,# Zechariah 1:1 saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 1:1 But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.# Evil ways and evil deeds are demonstrable yet a return to God is not merely about ceasing to do evil things but a return to fellowship.# A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external).# God invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27, Colossians 2:23# God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4# It is counted as violence to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4# In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.# An old commentator rephrased Paul\u0026rsquo;s words, I perceive that in all things yo are too superstitious. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? The fathers had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. Psa 90:10# Zechariah 1:1 And the prophets, do they live forever? Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to. # God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvatión is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jer 26:5, 2 Cor 6:2# Zechariah 1:1 \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,# Zechariah 1:1 overtake your fathers? Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still sends more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God's commands are still the same, even today# Zechariah 1:1 Then they repented and said, the word for repent (SHUB) is better translated here returned as it's referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. Compare the use of __\u0026lt;u\u0026gt;SHUB\u0026lt;/u\u0026gt;__ in Zec 1:3 with Zec 1:6# Zechariah 1:1 As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds,# Zechariah 1:1 so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Scripture states that 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers (Ezra 2:64–65), including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. (Ezra 2:70). Though these returned physically, overall, they did not turn to God. Jer 7:4 \u0026quot;Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.' Jer 7:8# A NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible is used in different ways and it has caused a lot of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original metanoia (change your mind). We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. # They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them. This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it first is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be right with God. Israel needed to come to God by faith, not merely saying they did wrong and accepting God's punishment.# The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of thinking, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said. Ezekiel 20:43# A short note about biblical repentance:# It\u0026rsquo;s not merely recognizing the wrong you have done. It\u0026rsquo;s not a focus on the admission of guilt. Matthew 27:3-5# It\u0026rsquo;s not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words.# It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9# It\u0026rsquo;s not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo; which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.# It\u0026rsquo;s not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance. This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today. The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic. Luke 3:8-18,# Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God, you change your thinking regarding what you are trusting in to trust God. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1# For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5# Or for a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16# The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him. Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, \u0026quot;Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned *by rote,* Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed.\u0026quot; Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are *done* in a dark place, And they say, \u0026quot;Who sees us?\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Who knows us?\u0026quot; You turn *things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, \u0026quot;He did not make me\u0026quot;; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, \u0026quot;He has no understanding\u0026quot;?\nGod wanted this generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith.\n\u0026quot;Return to me and I will return to you\u0026quot; - God\n“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”. (James 4:8 nkjv) III. Message #2 - Eight Visions# Vision Meaning 1 Horseman (1:7-17): Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt. The nations watched 2 Horns and craftsmen (1:18-21): The four empires will be terrified by four craftsmen 3 Measuring Jerusalem (2:1-13): Jerusalem measured=restored 4 High Priest (3:1-10): Judah rejects God, yet ultimately God will restore them 5 Olive Trees (4:1-14): God empowers his people through His Spirit 6 The Flying Scroll (5:1-4): 7 The Ephah (5:5-11): 8 Four Chariots (6:1-15): Gentiles judged / Christ\u0026rsquo;s reign On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, There are no Hebrew names given for months. Moses gave the law to the second generation on the first day of the 11th month. Deut 1:3\nwhich is the month Shebat, Shebat is the aquired Babylonian name for the eleventh month. This is the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel. in the second year of Darius,\nthe word of the LORD came\nto Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, this is three months after receiving the first message. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight visions in one night.\nOnce again Zechariah gives his ancestry. Zechariah was from a priestly line serving as a prophet. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was later compiled together to form all of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s prophecies.\nThe man on the Red Horse# as follows:\nI saw at night, Zechariah received this message in a vision at night. This was not a dream. He literally saw these things and describes what he saw in terms he and his audience understood.\nZechariah 1:8a I saw at night\u0026hellip; This is not a dream, it is a vision, he received while awake at night. Visions were received while awake and dreams are revelations while asleep. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Num 12:6\nand behold, a man was riding In verse 11 we are told this man is the angel of the Lord.\non a red horse, generally speaking red symbolizes blood as a result of war. This rider may have been riding in battle. Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. This man is none other than Jesus Christ. Revelation 6:4, Rev 19:19-21\nHorses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in contexts dealing with war.# The color red is often associated with blood and or war.# The angel of the Lord is ready to make war.# In Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.# and he was standing among the myrtle trees The rider on the red horse was riding but is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is no longer riding but standing under the shade of myrtle trees. Nehemiah 8:15 implies that myrtle trees possibly grew in or near Jerusalem. They are certainly all through modern Palestine. Most pictures of myrtle trees show it as a shrub about 8-10 feet tall but given the right conditions and with plenty of water, it grows to a considerable size. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther's Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 The pomegranate is also in the myrtle family\nInterestingly, myrtle trees are mentioned in other passages when God says he will turn the wilderness to blossom. Isa 41:19# In the fulfillment of the eternal covenant or New Covenant to Israel, God will turn briars into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isa 55:13# which were in the ravine, Jer 7:30-34 \u0026quot;For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight,\u0026quot; declares the LORD, \u0026quot;they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. \u0026quot;They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind. \u0026quot;Therefore, behold, days are coming,\u0026quot; declares the LORD, \u0026quot;when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place. \u0026quot;The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away.\u0026quot;Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin.Nehemiah, Isaiah and Zechariah mention myrtle trees. Nehemiah mentions myrtle branches during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths. Isaiah states that during the milenial reign when everything is restored, God will turn briars (result of man's sin) into myrtle trees. Isaiah 41:19, Isaiah 55:13,\nwith red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Red, sorrel and white horses behind him Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw. And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor's task to interpret some mysterious dream. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Rev 1:1 And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, the man on the red horse himself explains... \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; This is most likely something that is constantly going on. We know from Job 1:6-7 that Satan also roams to and fro over the earth. This angel patrol also roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7 So they answered the angel of the LORD The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 6 times in Zechariah. This “*man among the myrtle trees*” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), Many scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth. The angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), Abraham (18; 22:11–18), Jacob (31:11, 13), Moses (Ex. 3), Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23) and Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).\nwho was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth,\nand behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026quot;Peace! All is well!\u0026quot;. The response by the angel of the Lord reflects things are far from right in order to be at peace. There's nothing wrong with peace as long as it is attained the right way. The nations were at peace at the expense of God's nation Israel. God has no regard for man's way of peace apart from Him. True, ultimate world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from his throne in Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4 Peace does not come until Babylon is destroyed. Rev 17-18, Zech 5\nThen the angel of the LORD said,\n\u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah,\nThe angel of the Lord requests the Lord of hosts for compassion. For centuries, “*How long?*” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Psa 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “*How long?*” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven. Rev. 6:10 Yet God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9 ​\twith which You have been indignant ​\tthese seventy years?\u0026rdquo;\nGod had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, \u0026quot;how much longer are your people to suffer?\u0026quot; Jer 29:10. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 17 extra years had passed and still \u0026quot;*the earth is peaceful and quiet*\u0026quot; and no temple has been erected. Jer 29:10. The angel of the Lord's words reflect his concern for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026quot;*at peace*\u0026quot;. It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Act 1:7. It was told to Daniel that ultimately it would be 70 units of 7. This comes to a total of 490 years that yet have to be fulfilled in their purpose. Dan 9:24-27\n​\tThe LORD answered the angel ​\twho was speaking with me ​\twith gracious words, ​\tcomforting words. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the \u0026quot;accusation\u0026quot; and responds with kind words. Col 4:6\n​\tSo the angel ​\twho was speaking with me ​\tsaid to me, ​\t\u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying,\nThis message is not to be kept hidden it is to be announced. As a prophet Zechariah's task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Heb 1:1-2 This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zech 1:12# ​\t\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous\nThe Lord kindly responds \u0026quot;I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!\u0026quot; God has a strong devotion towards Israel. Isa 54:8, Heb 12:6-7 This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel. ​\tfor Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture we see how Zion is synonimous with Jerusalem. Yet here they shown distinct. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psa 2:6. Zion is the mountain on which God's house, the temple, stands. Mic 3:12. Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Mic 4:1, 3. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Mic 4:2\n\u0026ldquo;But I am very angry# ​\twith the nations ​\twho are at ease; ​\tfor while I was only a little angry, ​\tthey furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo;\npeace is a good thing but not at the cost of injustice. Israel is not in her land, she has been disbursed. Here the angel of the Lord is calling out for justice.\nThe Lord had said this would happen and had even promised to punish them (specifically in this case the Chaldeans) for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1 ​\t\u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, ​\t\u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem ​\twith compassion; ​\tMy house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; rebuilding of temple is foretold here ​\tdeclares the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;and a measuring line ​\twill be stretched ​\tover Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins.\nWe can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort. About 200 years earlier, God had announced through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this....*\u0026quot;It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'\u0026quot;* Isa 44:28. Zechariah adds to Isaiah's prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10 Zechariah adds to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10 \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying,# ​\t\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow ​\twith prosperity, ​\tand the LORD will again ​\tcomfort Zion ​\tand again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThe Lord of hosts (He who battles for them) is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zech 6:15 # While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah's time, verse 17 is clearly yet future. # Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026quot;*...you will know that I am the Lord*\u0026quot; Ex 6:7# When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zech 13:9# When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Eze 36:11# When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Eze 36:23# When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Eze 36:36.# When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Eze 36:38.# When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Eze 37:6.# When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Eze 37:13# When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Eze 37:14# When God's sanctuary will stand among them forever. Eze 37:28# When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Eze 38:23# When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Eze 39:28# Four Horns \u0026amp; Four Craftsmen# God's anger at the nations and his mercy on Israel. Isaiah 47:6, 11\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Horns used this way, typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. Psa 75:10, Dan 7-8, Rev 12-13, 17\n​\tSo I said to the angel ​\twho was speaking with me, ​\t\u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; ​\tAnd he answered me, ​\t\u0026ldquo;These are the horns ​\twhich have scattered ​\tJudah, ​\tIsrael ​\tand Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; This may be referring to a future time. It speaks of four horns (gentile nations) that already had scattered Judah. Option 1 (past): The four horns had already come. Perhaps this refers to the four nations (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) mentioned in 2 Kings 24:2 that God used to scatter Judah. # Option 2 (future): The four horns are not yet completed. Assyria is stated as being the first to scatter, then Babylon and Medo Persia were guilty of this so the fourth was yet to come, referring to Rome. Jer 50:17-18, Eze 34:11-24 # Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; Even though the horns would scatter Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would terrify them and throw them down. This served to encourage the reader that though things seemed helpless, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who would ultimately have the last word. Then I lifted up my eyes# and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. Zechariah saw a man who had an instrument to measure in his hand. So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah was puzzled as to where the man was going. It may be because the current city of Jerusalem and it's borders were unclear and was was actually there was a barren land since it had been demolished. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel. and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, God commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the angel to *run*! Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.\n\u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited# without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. 'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, `God himself will be the protecting wall around the city.` and I will be the glory in her midst.'\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026quot; declares the LORD, \u0026quot;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026quot; declares the LORD. \u0026quot;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026quot; `Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon. The daughter of Babylon refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isa 47, Psa 137:8, Rev 17 This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Rev 17:5` For thus says the LORD of hosts,# \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches it, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deut 32:9-10 \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately *shatter them like earthenware* and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psa 2 Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon. Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zech 9:9\nfor behold I am coming# and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.\nClearly a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel's rule. About 20 References of \u0026quot;*in that day*\u0026quot; are found in Zechariah. When God returns and comforts Jerusalem. When God defends the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Zech 12:6 When God will destroy the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zech 12:3, 9 When God will remove all idolatry from the land. Zech 13:2 When Messiah stands on the mount of Olives. He will reign over all the earth from Zion. Zech 14:4, 9# This must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst.# Then I will dwell in your midst, Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ will one day dwell in their midst forever. and you will know# that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present God has placed His program with them on hold. One day though, God will once again work directly in and through Israel. Rom 11:11-12, 25\n\u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;# God is angered at the current situation and laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isa 62:1-4\nJoshua the high priest and his friends# Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35 Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when \u0026quot;the Branch\u0026quot; rules\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! This must be Jesus rebuking Satan Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan's accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem. Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Now Joshua was clothed\twith filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments? Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the obvious next step, \u0026quot;don't forget the turban!!\u0026quot;. Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on... So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house ``God gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Eze 44:15-16 Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27and also have charge of My courts, The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests would be placed in charge of all the courts. and I will grant you free access among these who are standing *here.*The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. `\nNotice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here...\u0026quot;IF you will walk...then you will govern my house\u0026quot;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.\nIn the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 2:5\n​\t\u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest. ​\tyou and your friends ​\twho are sitting in front of you— ​\tindeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends symbolize all the priests ​\tfor behold, I am going to bring in My servant ​\tthe Branch. God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jer 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13 ​\t\u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone ​\tthat I have set before Joshua; ​\ton one stone are seven eyes. THis addition is very interesting...\u0026quot;before Joshua\u0026quot; the stone. The cornerstone. The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6 ​\tBehold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; ​\tdeclares the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity ​\tof that land in one day. ​\t\u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy ​\tdeclares the LORD of hosts, ​\t\u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor ​\tto sit under his vine ​\tand under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Hab 3:17\nA Lampstand of gold# Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to so he was wide awake when receiving the vision. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Ex 25:37 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo; Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, a specific message to Zerubbabel... who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12). His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge.`\n\u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026quot;ease does not produce strength\u0026quot;. Grace is what teaches us about God's provision against sin, God inner strengthening of His Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit teaches us in all truth (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are commanded to get our strenghtening by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2) \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubbabel Zerubbabel or look what we accomplished. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!\nAlso the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house,\nand his hands will finish it. Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God.This prophecy was fulfilled when the temple was completed five years later in 515b.C. ​\tThen you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. ​\t\u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? ​\tBut these seven will be glad ​\twhen they see the plumb line ​\tin the hand of Zerubbabel—a plumb line is used for building. When God sees them back at rebuilding the temple, it will be a joyous thing to God. ​\tthese are the eyes of the LORD the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6 ​\twhich range to and fro ​\tthroughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;\nSo he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4\nA Flying Scroll# Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5? Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nEphah going forth# Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nTwo Women# Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nFour Chariots# Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIV. Message #3 -# In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.\n\u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days, \u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nV. Message #4 - The Two Burdens# Burden #1 - The First Coming# The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain— The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nBurden #2 - The Second Coming# The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.\nThen the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.\nNow this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.\nSo also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.\nThen it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=========================\nZechariah# possible: Israel\u0026rsquo;s Messiah to the Nations (Phrased + Indented + Comments)\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said, \u0026quot;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026quot; The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026quot;Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026quot;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026quot; 'Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026quot;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026quot; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026quot;' \u0026quot;Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026quot;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026quot;'\u0026quot; Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, \u0026quot;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026quot; Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026quot;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026quot; Again he said to him, \u0026quot;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026quot; Then I said, \u0026quot;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026quot; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, \u0026quot;Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing *here.* 'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you— indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. 'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to *sit* under *his* vine and under *his* fig tree.'\u0026quot; Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel— these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo; Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth. Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, \u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo; Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.\n\u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days, \u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain— The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, all of them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages. Then the LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo; So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. The LORD said to me, \u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, \u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nBehold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.\nThen the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea;\nZechariah 14:8-11 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. (9) And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one... People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Isaiah 11:9-10 They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea. (10) Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious. Isaiah 60:18-20 No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. (19) The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. (20) Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.\n​\tit will be in summer ​\tas well as in winter. what does this mean? does it happen in summer and winter simultaneously? Probably not since Jerusalem is the center? This is probably referring to the amount of time...lingering on from summer and going into the winter. ​\tAnd the LORD will be king ​\tover all the earth; ​\tin that day ​\tthe LORD will be the only one, ​\tand His name the only one. ​\tAll the land will be changed ​\tinto a plain ​\tfrom Geba ​\tto Rimmon ​\tsouth of Jerusalem; ​\tbut Jerusalem will rise ​\tand remain on its site ​\tfrom Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate ​\tas far as the place ​\tof the First Gate ​\tto the Corner Gate, ​\tand from the Tower of Hananel ​\tto the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. ​\tPeople will live in it, ​\tand there will no longer be a curse, ​\tfor Jerusalem will dwell in security.\nNow this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; against those who have gone against Jerusalem and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.\nSo also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.\nThen it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. When God gave the law, he commanded that Israel should live in tents or booths during the feast on the seventh month (Tishri). Nehemiah 8:14 For seven days, starting the fifteenth day of the seventh month Israel was to have a feast. During this time, they were to dwell in tents or booths. Leviticus 23:16, 34 This was a feast of celebration after the harvest was gathered. Deuteronomy 16:13 This feast is mentioned in Zechariah 3 times and only near the end of chapter 14. Zechariah 14:16, 18-19 The feast of booths/tabernacles was celebrated after the harvest. During the Millenial reign of Christ, not only will Israel but all of the nations will come to celebrate the great havest of souls. This may be the connection with the 70 bulls that were sacrificed and symbolized the 70 Gentiles nations of Genesis 10. Numbers 29:12-34\nIn that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day. \u0026lsquo;What a strange last statement to make before finishing up the fulfillment of God\u0026rsquo;s promises. Surely this had to be hopeful news, but why? Why are the Canaanites singled out?\n===========================\nZechariah# (Chronology + Conversation)\nIn the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nSo they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said,\n\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel of the LORD said,\n\u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo;\nThe LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he answered me,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up theirhorns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him,\n\u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan,\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo;\nSo they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. \u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;\nSo the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nAlso the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to him,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I answered,\n\u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;\nI said,\n\u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.\nI said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.\nThen I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;\nThe angel replied to me,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. \u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; And He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.\nThen He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo;\nThe word of the LORD also came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set iton the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026quot; Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? \u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. \u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts; \u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD, \u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. \u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. \u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. \u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! \u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. \u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026lsquo;So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificialbasin, Drenched like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. \u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. \u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemyin the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. \u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. \u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026ldquo;When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026ldquo;I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo; And their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026ldquo;but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo; So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo; I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo; So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.\nThen the LORD said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\nThe LORD said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026ldquo;Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,\n\u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026ldquo;In that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026ldquo;In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026ldquo;And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026ldquo;In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026ldquo;In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026ldquo;Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n=========================\n========================\nZechariah# (Chronology + Conversation)\nZACARíAS 1.

There is no king of Israel or Judah at this time. Zerubbabel is governor. The line of David is off the throne, and the Times of the Gentiles are in progress. (Luke 21:24, Rom 11:25). The eighth month was called Bul (1 Kings 6:38) but after exile evidently Marcheshvan - \u0026quot;rainy\u0026quot; (Josephus).\nthe word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, “The second year of Darius” is the same year in which Haggai prophesied. Haggai was given a prophecy in September (to begin rebuilding temple), October (Hag 2), and December, but none in November. So this man Zechariah was given a prophecy in November, the month Haggai missed. Two months before this message, they had began to rebuild the temple. One month before, they were discouraged. Haggai gave them an encouraging message of hope (Hag 2). - Zechariah is mentioned as head of the family (Neh 12:4++). This means in 520 Zechariah was probably a young man. Zechariah was a prophet - this was his rank.\nthe son of Berechiah, (Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - Yahweh blesses\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Berechiah, the __fa__ther of Zechariah.\na. Jesus menciona a un profeta martirizado llamado Zaracías hijo de Berequías en Mat 23:35. Lucas no lo menciona. Luc 11:51, 2 Cró 24:20-22. Es dificil saber con certeza.# i. Opción 1: Berequias significa lo mismo que Jehoiada.# ii. Opción 2: Berequías era el padre mientras que Jehoiada era su abuelo.# iii. Opción 3: Jesus era testigo del asesinato de Zacarías al igual que Abel.# - Matthew was familiar with Zechariah. In fact he quotes it three times. The fact that Jesus mentions Zechariah of Berechiah as a martyr would have surprised Matthew and therefore he noted it. Zechariah 9:9, 11:13, 13:7# iv. Option 4: Error in transcription\u0026rsquo;# the son of Iddo saying, (Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - grandfather of Zechariah. One of the priests/levites who returned from Babylon (Neh 12:4, Neh 12:16)\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. \u0026quot; 70 years exile is proof. Zechariah makes it clear, the reason they were in captivity was because they had displeased the Lord.\nTherefore say to them,\n\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, LORD of hosts - 52x in Zechariah. The way it is used it “implies the boundless resources at His command for His people's good\u0026quot;- fausset. He is rich in mercy (Eph 2:4). He is rich in power (Matt 28:18). This is some false prophet. This is a message from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to the importance of the message. APP: What does God have to say about this/that? \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, invitation to a spiritual return at the time of a physical return. In the midst of physical returning, God invites Judah into a relationship, not religious rote.\n\u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts. This is clearly Zechariah emphasizing God's continual offer of forgiveness. The Lord of hosts would return to be theirs upon their return to HIM, not to the land! Q: were the people thinking all was well because they were back in the land? Once they rebuilt the temple, would they think God had returned to them? Was their religion what God looked for?\n\u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, former prophets: Hosea. Joel. Amos. Isaiah. Jeremiah. This is important to the message of Zechariah - God spoke to the people through the prophets of old. The people did not listen, therefore they were wrong and God was angered. They were exiled. Zechariah is appealing to the people...look what happened when God (through the prophets of old) was not listened to. Now listen to God as He speaks through me.\n\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, It's not Zechariah's word, it's the Lord of host\n\u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; This can be better understood in the light of what Haggai says in Hag 2:10-14. Two ways to understand men of old: through the lens of religion and the dogmas they enforced and try to replicate the formula to produce the same results. The other lens is to understand what God was doing at a specific time through failed people and simple learn from the past within it's specific time. How can that apply to us today? The latter is the correct lens.\nBut they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD.\n\u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? \u0026quot; The fathers were dead. The prophets were dead and their message died with them. Did God keep speaking the same message (through the same prophets) forever? NO! God was patient but not passive. But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? The anticipated answer is, YES!\nThen they repented and said, they repented: (SHUB - return) this is not the same meaning as METANOIA in NT. This means simply to return. Religious or otherwise. It is often assumed SHUB is the same as METANOIA. They are not. Acts 26:20 shows METANOIA is not return.\n\u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Jeremiah 23:20 **\u0026quot;The anger of the LORD will not turn back Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; In the last days you will clearly understand it.** Mal 3:7\u0026quot;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes and have not kept them. Return to Me, and I will return to you,\u0026quot; says the LORD of hosts. \u0026quot;But you say, 'How shall we return?'\nSUMMARY NOTE: Were Haggai and Zechariah effective? Did the people listen? Ezra says thanks to them the temple was rebuilt: \u0026quot;Ezr 6:14 And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\u0026quot; Message #2 - Zechariah received a series of visions\n- *(Year 2, month 11 [Shebat] of Darius)* In a series of eight night visions, God explains His involvement with His people.\nVision Meaning 1 Horsemen (1:7-17): Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt. The nations watched (near fulfillment) 2 Horns and craftsmen (1:18-21): The four empires will be terrified by four craftsmen (near) 3 Measuring Line (2:1-13): Jerusalem measured=restored (near) 4 High Priest (3:1-10): Judah rejects God, yet ultimately God will restore them (near) 5 Olive Trees (4:1-14): God empowers his people through His Spirit (near) 6 The Flying Scroll (5:1-4): (far) 7 The Ephah (5:5-11): (far) 8 Four Chariots (6:1-15): Gentiles judged / Christ\u0026rsquo;s reign (far) Vision #1 - The Horseman\nGod watches the nations. God will rebuild Jerusalem and the temple\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month,\nwhich is the month Shebat, the month is named this time. Is there a reason?\nin the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:\nI saw at night, a vision at night\nand behold, a man was riding on a red horse, No explanation is given as tot he colours of the horses. a red horse, is it death, war?\nand he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, Myrtle trees are seen as blessing from God in Isaiah 55:1-13. God will turn briars into myrtle trees. The fact that this rider is standing among myrtle trees in the ravine speaks of blessing.\nwith red, sorrel and white horses behind him. red horse, sorrel (brown), white horses\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; An angel was also there\nAnd the angel who was speaking with me said to me, This angel is similar to Gabriel who came to explain the meaning of the visions\n\u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; The interpreting angel says, \u0026quot;i will show you. I will explain to you\u0026quot;\nAnd the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, now the man on the red horse speaks\n\u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; Are there always those patroling the earth? Is this a one-time event?\nSo they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, they? The red horse and white horses? Angel of the Lord, man on the red horse, man standing among the myrtle trees. Same person?\nTHE ANGEL OF THE LORD: (6x in Zechariah). This “man among the myrtle trees” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times made temporary preincarnate appearances on earth. As the Angel of the Lord, the Son of God appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), Abraham (18; 22:11–18), Jacob (31:11, 13), Moses (Ex. 3), Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23), Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).\n\u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; These horsemen answer to the angel of the Lord. When is the earth peaceful and quiet? In relation to what? Evidently in relation to the defense/prosperity of Jerusalem. The nations were at ease.This is wrong since the Jews are not in the land. Then the angel of the LORD said,\n\u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; The Angel of the Lord answers to God the Father. In this case he intercedes for the people...\u0026quot;how long?\u0026quot;. The events of the vision take place after the 70 years in exile. The expectation is the reconquering (compassion) of the land. For centuries, “How long?” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Ps. 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “How long?” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven (Rev. 6:10). That the Son of God should so identify Himself with the cries of His people reveals His compassion and concern. “In all their distress he too was distressed” (Isa. 63:9 niv).- wiersbe\nThe LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.Zechariah makes mention of the mercy in the Lord's words. This is the nature of all prophecy. IT is to bring hope and comfort to the reader.\nSo the angel who was speaking with me said to me, this is the interpreting angel. \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, this was to be what Zechariah was to tell the people. \u0026quot;NOTICE: proclaim...the message God gave him\u0026quot;\n\u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. Jerusalem and Zion are distinguished here. Possibly the city vs the holy mountain Psa 2:6, Isa 10:32, Mic 3:12, Mic 4:1-2\n\u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; The Lord said this would happen and had even promised to punish the Chaldeans for their harsh treatment of the Jews. HAB 2:8\n\u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD,\n\u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; what is a measuring line? You can't measure something that isn't there. My house (temple #2) will be built. Zechariah 4:10 \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, especially Jerusalem\nVision #2 - Four Horns\nGod concerns himself with the four gentile nations who have risen against Israel and Judah\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, horns are generally empires or powers\n\u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he answered me,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; four horns, IF ISRAEL and if this deals with the period up to that time, then (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Medo-Persia?). If 4 horns of Daniel and after 70x7 then it deals with the 4 horns from the times of the Gentiles starting with Babylon. A key interpretive phrase is \u0026quot;have scattered...\u0026quot;Does this deal with Zechariah's past or from Zechariah's vision's past? Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, Zechariah was shown 4 craftsmen. What are craftsmen? 1. Blacksmiths 2. Carpenters 3. Masons 4. Warriors 5. Jewelers. 2 Kings 22:6 distinguishes craftsmen from masons. 2 kings 24:16 mentions \u0026quot;1000 craftsmen...strong and fit for war\u0026quot;. 2 Chr 24:12 mentions craftsmen who were hired to rebuild the temple. Isa 40:19-20 connects craftsmen to idol makers. Isa 54:16 God makes the smith (craftsmen) to form the weapons out of iron. Nebuchadnezzar took all the crafstmen to Babylon. Eze 21:31 seems to refer to craftsmen as leaders, brutal men skilled in destruction. It does appear at first glance that God wants Zechariah to know the four horns are dealt with so as to not be discouraged.\n\u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; It is good when Zechariah asks questions for us becuase he generally gets an answer. He asks not who are they but what are they coming to do, so Zechariah's curiosity is in regards to their purpose. If 70 years then these 4 craftsmen already came. If 70x7 then the 4 craftsmen could be during the tribulation? And he said, the interpreting angel\n\u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; four craftsmen? What they're doing is answered: To terrify the four horns...to throw them down. Evidently their identity is not important. Their purpose and is.Psa 75:10\nVision #3 - The Man Measuring the Temple\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. Similar scene to Rev 11 except this is in referince to the city not the temple. So I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; Not what are you doing, but where are you going? The man seems to be walking away somewhere not evident to Zechariah, perhaps because at the time there was no city to speak of, it was in ruins.\nAnd he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; not measuring the temple as Rev 11 but Jersusalem. What was the state of Jerusalem at the time?\u0026quot;\nAnd behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, what angel is going to measure with the man? Where is the angel 'coming out' from? Coming out from the city? A note about the status of Jerusalem at this point in history: Jerusalem was destoyed: Jeremiah 26;18, 2 Chro 36:17-21, Eze 33:21 Jerusalem will be rebuilt: Temple will be rebuilt within 4 years (by the sixth year of king Darius): Ezra 6:14-15 under Zerubbabel: 2 Chr 36:22-23, Zechariah 4:9\nJerusalem walls rebuilt: Neh 2:3, Neh 2:17\n\u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, Zechariah is refered to as young man by the new angel.\n\u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; The Lord will cause Jerusalem to be rebuilt (inhabited).2 Chr 36:22-23, Neh 2\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. Genesis 12\n\u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them THE NATIONS will feel the wave of the hand of God over them\nso that they will be plunder for their slaves. Calamity due to their slaves - the jews.\nThen you Judah\nwill know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. Is Jesus speaking? It's no doubt when it happens. God did it. They would know it.\n\u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Emanuel? God with us? John 1:14, Mat 4:13-17. This is true of the first coming but ultimately fullfiled in the second coming. As we see following... \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. At first glance this could be refering to Jesus' first coming but it says (after the nations join), then I will dwell...this must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst. In that day...\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, your kingdom come.\n\u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; Isa 62:1-4\nVision #4 - Joshua the High Priest\nJoshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35 Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when \u0026quot;the Branch\u0026quot; rules\nThen he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan,\n\u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! the Lord said Satan. This must be Jesus rebuking Satan\nIndeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan is not after Joshua, but who Joshua represents - Israel\nIs this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo;\nNow Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments?\n\u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's.\nThen I said,\n\u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; Perhaps the obvious next step, \u0026quot;don't forget the turban!!\u0026quot;. Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on...\nSo they who, the angels?\nput a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. Notice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here...\u0026quot;IF you will walk...then you will govern my house\u0026quot;. The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.\n\u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, \u0026quot;your friends\u0026quot; in other words, religious leaders - these the priests, pharisees, saducees?\nfor behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jer 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13\n\u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. THis addition is very interesting...\u0026quot;before Joshua\u0026quot; the stone. The cornerstone. The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6\nBehold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, inscription on the rock?\n\u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; this is Messianic prophecy\ndeclares the LORD of hosts, \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Hab 3:17\nVision #5 - The Lampstand\nThen the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to state was he saw.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks\nand its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Ex 25:37\nalso two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo;\nThen I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;\nSo the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me, particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained\n\u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, a specific message to Zerubbabel...\n\u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. certainly contrary to those who say, \u0026quot;ease does not produce strength\u0026quot;. Grace is what teaches us (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are to be strenghtened by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2)\n\u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!\nVision #6 - Two Annointed Ones\nAlso the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God. \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—a plumb line is used for building. these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6\nThen I said to him,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo; First he asks what are the olive TREES\nAnd I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo; Now he asks what are the olive BRANCHES. the two witnesses from Revelation?\nSo he answered me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I said,\n\u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said,\n\u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo; Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4\nThen I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd I answered,\n\u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo; the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5?\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; tribulation?\nsurely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.\n\u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; the justice of God - he will make it go forth.\nand it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo; total consumption\nThen the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;\nI said,\n\u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo;\nAnd he said,\n\u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo; Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; is this the harlot Babylon?\nAnd he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. Rev 17-18?\nVision #7 - Two Winged Women serve \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; to build a temple in Shinar\nThen I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.\nI said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;\nThen he said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her the harlot Babylon\nin the land of Shinar; a return to Babel\nand when it is prepared, The temple\nshe will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo; a temple will be built in Babylon\nVision #8 - Four Chariots\nNow I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; the two mountains?\nand the mountains were bronze mountains. With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. Very similar to the 4 horsemen in Revelation\nThen I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me,\n\u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo; not where or who but what. Later we are told these respond to the angel of the Lord. Are they angels sent to patrol and appear to Zech as chariots? The angel replied to me, not the angel of the Lord, but the interpreting angel\n\u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,\nwith one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; drought? Famine?\nand the white ones go forth after them, false conquest? Antichrist?\nwhile the dappled ones go forth to the south country. ``\n\u0026ldquo;When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo;\nAnd He said, \u0026ldquo;Go, patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; So they patrolled the earth.\nThen He cried out to me and spoke to me saying,\n\u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo; does this imply repentance or justice served?\nThe word of the LORD also came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.\n\u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \u0026quot; why would the high priest wear the crown?\nThen say to him,\n\u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nThen you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.\nMessage #3\n*(year 4, month 9 [Chislev] of Darius)*\nIn the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.\nNow the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, \u0026lsquo;When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted?\n\u0026lsquo;When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? \u0026lsquo;Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus has the LORD of hosts said, \u0026lsquo;Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.\n\u0026ldquo;They made their hearts like flint\nso that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets;\ntherefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts;\n\u0026ldquo;but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known.\nThus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD,\n\u0026lsquo;I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called *the Holy Mountain.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. \u0026lsquo;And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people,\nand I will be their God in truth and righteousness.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;Let your hands be strong, by His spirit\nyou who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets,\nthose who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.\n\u0026lsquo;For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.\n\u0026lsquo;But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026lsquo;For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.\n\u0026lsquo;It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!\n\u0026lsquo;These are the things which you should do:\nspeak the truth to one another;\njudge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.\n\u0026lsquo;Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD.\u0026rdquo;\nBurden #1\nThen the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\n\u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;The fast of the fourth,\nthe fast of the fifth,\nthe fast of the seventh and\nthe fast of the tenth months\nwill become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah;\nso love truth and peace.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. \u0026lsquo;The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.\u0026rdquo; '\nSo many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts\nin Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nThus says the LORD of hosts,\n\u0026lsquo;In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, \u0026ldquo;Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nThe burden of the word of the LORD is against\nthe land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it;\nTyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.\nAshkelon will see it and be afraid.\nGaza too will writhe in great pain;\nAlso Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.\nAnd a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth.\nThen they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.\nBut I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.\nRejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you;\nHe is just and endowed with salvation,\nHumble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.\nI will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem;\nAnd the bow of war will be cut off.\nAnd He will speak peace to the nations;\nAnd His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.\nAs for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.\nReturn to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior\u0026rsquo;s sword.\nThen the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, Drenched like the corners of the altar.\nAnd the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain.\nTherefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.\n\u0026ldquo;My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.\n\u0026ldquo;From them will come the cornerstone,\nFrom them the tent peg,\nFrom them the bow of battle,\nFrom them every ruler, all of them together. \u0026ldquo;They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.\n\u0026ldquo;I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.\n\u0026ldquo;Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. \u0026ldquo;I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. \u0026quot;\nWhen I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. \u0026quot;\nI will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them. \u0026ldquo;And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. \u0026ldquo;And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds\u0026rsquo; wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions\u0026rsquo; roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, \u0026ldquo;Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter. \u0026ldquo;Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, \u0026lsquo;Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!\u0026rsquo;\nAnd their own shepherds have no pity on them. \u0026ldquo;For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD; \u0026quot;\nbut behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another\u0026rsquo;s power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.\nAnd I took for myself two staffs:\nthe one I called Favor and\nthe other I called Union;\nso I pastured the flock.\nThen I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.\nThen I said, \u0026ldquo;I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another\u0026rsquo;s flesh.\u0026rdquo;\nI took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces,\nto break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.\nSo it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.\nI said to them, \u0026ldquo;If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!\u0026rdquo;\nSo they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.\nThen the LORD said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Throw it to the potter, that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.\nThen I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\nThe LORD said to me,\n\u0026ldquo;Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. \u0026ldquo;For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land\nwho will not care for the perishing,\nseek the scattered,\nheal the broken,\nor sustain the one standing,\nbut will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs. \u0026quot;\nWoe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock!\nA sword will be on his arm And on his right eye!\nHis arm will be totally withered\nAnd his right eye will be blind.\u0026rdquo;\nBurden #2\nThe burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.\nThus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,\n\u0026ldquo;Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. \u0026quot;\nIt will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples;\nall who lift it will be severely injured.\nAnd all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. \u0026quot;\nIn that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. \u0026ldquo;Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, \u0026lsquo;A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.\u0026rsquo; \u0026quot;\nIn that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. \u0026quot;\nIn that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. \u0026quot;\nAnd in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. \u0026ldquo;I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. \u0026quot;\nIn that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. \u0026ldquo;The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. \u0026quot;\nIn that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. \u0026quot;\nIt will come about in that day,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. \u0026ldquo;And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, \u0026lsquo;You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD\u0026rsquo;; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. \u0026quot;\nAlso it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, \u0026lsquo;I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;And one will say to him, \u0026lsquo;What are these wounds between your arms?\u0026rsquo; Then he will say, \u0026lsquo;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u0026rsquo; \u0026ldquo;Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD of hosts. \u0026ldquo;Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. \u0026ldquo;It will come about in all the land,\u0026rdquo; Declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it. \u0026ldquo;And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, \u0026lsquo;They are My people,\u0026rsquo; And they will say, \u0026lsquo;The LORD is my God.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.\nIn that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!\nIn that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.\nAnd in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth;\nin that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin\u0026rsquo;s Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king\u0026rsquo;s wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.\nIt will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another\u0026rsquo;s hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.\nIn that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, \u0026ldquo;HOLY TO THE LORD.\u0026rdquo; And the cooking pots in the LORD\u0026rsquo;S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.\nAnd there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.\n"},{

The opposition remained quiet until hearing back from king Darius I regarding the authenticity of the decree issued by Cyrus. Ezra 5:5# Zechariah 1:1c the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, Zech 1:1, Zech 1:7# Not much is told to us about Berechiah except he was the father of Zechariah.# Jesus mentioned a martyrd prophet called Zechariah son of Berechiah in Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions this but leaves Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s name out. Luk 11:51# It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to know why it is stated this way in Matthew since we don\u0026rsquo;t know how Zechariah dies and there is another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who was a prophet that had lived 300 years earlier that was killed by the people. 2 Chr. 24:20-22# Opción 1: Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. Since they mean the same, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus# Opción 2: Both Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s may have had fathers named Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather.# Opción 3: Error in transcription# Opción 4: Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah\u0026rsquo;s murder just the same as he did Abel\u0026rsquo;s. This seems the most plausible option of the 4.# Matthew was also familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would have caught his attention to hear Jesus state it.# Iddo, was Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s grandfather. He was a priest. Iddo is listed among those who returned from Babylon. Neh 12:1-4# En 520 Zechariah is probably a young man. Zac 2:4# Zechariah was a prophet. This was his roll.# Zechariah 1:2 \u0026ldquo;The LORD was very angry with your fathers. Having been exiled for 70 years is proof of this. 2 Chr 36# Zechariah 1:3 \u0026ldquo;Therefore say to them, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts,# Zechariah was to speak God\u0026rsquo;s word to the people, this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua.# Lord of Hosts appears 52 times in Zecharias. The way this title of God is used implies the unlimited resources available at his disposition for his people.# God is rich in mercy. Efe 2:4# God is abundant in power. Mat 28:18# Zechariah is no false prophet. His message comes from the Lord of hosts himself. This is crucial to see the importance of his message. Thankfully Zerubbabel and Joshua didn\u0026rsquo;t question the authority of Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s message.# Zechariah 1:3 \u0026ldquo;Return to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;that I may return to you,\u0026rdquo; says the LORD of hosts.# The opposite of return is to forsake. They had forsaken the Lord needed to return. The result would be God\u0026rsquo;s returning to them as the Lord of hosts to His nation.# Zechariah 1:4a \u0026ldquo;Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.\u0026rdquo; God knew their ways were evil. Rev 2:1-7# 1. Evil ways and evil deeds are demonstrable yet a return to God is not merely about ceasing to do evil things but a return to fellowship.# A return to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external).# Zechariah 1:4b \u0026ldquo;But they did not listen or give heed to Me,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. The previous generation did not listen to God, they did not change their minds and continued on even expecting the consequences. Zech 7:11-14# God invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious rote. Zech 7:4-6, Zech 8:2, Amo 5:21-27, Col 2:23,# According to the dictionary, rote is mechanical or unthinking routine or repetition.# God hates religious rote as a replacement for a relationship with Himself. Isa 1:12-18, Sant. 1:26# Religious rote is considered violence to the law. Eze 22:26, Zep 3:4# In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the Athenians on Mars Hill. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u0026ldquo;Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects.# An old commentator rephrased Paul\u0026rsquo;s words, I perceive that in all things yo are too superstitious. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23# Zechariah 1:5 \u0026ldquo;Your fathers, where are they? The great majority of that generation died while in exile. Most did not return. Psa 90:10,# Zechariah 1:5b And the prophets, do they live forever? Now those prophets were gone, their message should have been heeded at the moment it was proclaimed. Delayed obedience is disobedience.# God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God\u0026rsquo;s offer of salvatión is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jer 26:5, 2 Cor 6:2# Zechariah 1:6 \u0026ldquo;But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? \u0026hellip;God had made it abundantly known and clear to everyone. They didn\u0026rsquo;t have an excuse.# Zechariah 1:6b Then they repented and said, \u0026lsquo;As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us...the term repented is a bit confusing here.# The word SHUB \u0026ldquo;repented\u0026rdquo; could also be translated as \u0026ldquo;returned\u0026rdquo; (KJV). Compare the use of SHUB in Zec 1:3 with Zec 1:6# If we are to think they repented, then they are being referred to in a positive light. Yet the whole argument to the admonition hinges on the fact that the previous generation did not do what was right.# The purpose then must be to show the previous generation had returned, accepting their fate as from God for doing wrong but were still not trusting God. This present generation should not take that approach with God, but rather repent.# The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of thinking, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said. Eze 20:43# A short note about biblical repentance:# It\u0026rsquo;s not merely recognizing the wrong you have done. It\u0026rsquo;s not a focus on the admission of guilt. Mat 27:3-5# It\u0026rsquo;s not feeling sorrow for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words.# It is true that God\u0026rsquo;s kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Rom 2:4, 2 Cor 7:9# It\u0026rsquo;s not ceasing from sin, promising not to sin or changing one\u0026rsquo;s life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase \u0026ldquo;repent of your sins\u0026rdquo; is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 does say \u0026ldquo;repent for the forgiveness of sins\u0026rdquo;.# It\u0026rsquo;s not something you measure to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance. This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today. The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic. Luk 3:8-18,# Biblical repentance is changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God, you change your thinking regarding what you are trusting in to trust God. Act 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isa 1:18, Heb 6:1# For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God\u0026rsquo;s offer made through the Gospel (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luk 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luk 13:1-5# Or for a believer in error should repent (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Rev 2:21, Rev 3:3, Rev 3:19, 1 Jn 1:9, Rom 6:1-11, Rom 8:12-13, Gal 5:16# Conclusion of Message #1# God invited this generation to return to himself. It was an invitation to a relationship of trust and dependance in God. The previous generation had disobeyed God. They returned physically to the land, they even recognized their error but never changed their minds and placed their faith in God alone. Returning to God is an act of faith (changing one\u0026rsquo;s mind towards God) not by external works (ie returning to the land, rebuilding the temple).\nZechariah 1:7-6:15 - Message #2 - Eight Visions# The eight visions Zechariah were given to serve as an encouragement to the nation. Essentially a greater understanding of Messiah and His kingdom is given. Throughout history God has been progressively revealing His redemptive plan through His Son.\nMat 1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations. Matthew appears to be dividing Jewish history into forms of ruling. It went from aristocracy, to monarchy, to oligarchy, to Messiah. Jesus Christ the son of Abraham, the son of David, is presented as the Messiah (called the Christ). Matt 1:1, John 4:25, Luk 2:11\n​\tThe Messiah was recognized by:\n​\tThe blind - Joh 9:38\n​\tThe demons - Luk 4:41\n​\tThe elderly - Luk 2:25-38\n​\tFishermen. - Luk 9:20,\n​\tCriminals - Luke 23:39-42\n​\tThe Scriptures - Luke 24:46, Act 2:31,\n​\tWomen - Joh 11:27\n​\tEarly believers - Act 5:42\n​\tSamarians - Acts 8:12\n​\tPious Jews - Act 18:5\n​\tThe Law - Gal 3:24\nZechariah received these 8 visions in one night.\n1.

Four Chariots (6:1-15): Gentiles judged / Christ\u0026rsquo;s reign The Branch Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of a rider among the myrtle Trees# Zechariah 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, \u0026hellip;three months after receiving the first message, Zechariah receives another message from the Lord in the form of 8 visions in one night. Zech 1:1# Zechariah 1:7b the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: God spoke again to Zechariah and it happened like this\u0026hellip;# Once again Zechariah gives his ancestry. Zechariah was from a priestly line serving as a prophet.# Zechariah 1:8a I saw at night\u0026hellip; This is not a dream, it is a vision, he received while awake at night. Visions were received while awake and dreams are revelations while asleep. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Num 12:6# Zechariah 1:8b and behold, a man was riding on a red horse\u0026hellip; The first thing Zechariah saw was a man on a red horse. In verse 11 we are told this man is the angel of the Lord.# Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are also often seen in contexts dealing with war.# The color red is often associated with blood and or war.# Here we see the angel of the Lord is ready to make war while in Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.# Zechariah 1:8b and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, Interestingly, myrtle trees are mentioned in other passages when God says he will turn the wilderness to blossom. Isa 41:19# The myrtle tree has dark green, scented leaves, delicate starry white flowers and dark-colored berries, which are eaten.# It is rare to see a tree growing in the desert. One day God\u0026rsquo;s promise to Israel is that He will make the desert blossom. The myrtle tree is a reminder of this. God will turn briars into myrtle trees. Isa 55:13# Myrtle was used during the feast of tabernacles to build the booths among other things. Neh 8:15# Esther\u0026rsquo;s name in Hebrew is Myrtle. Esth 2:7# Zechariah 1:8c with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. The man among the myrtle trees in not the only one on a red horse. No other information is given by the angel regarding the meaning of the colours of the horses.# There are horses and chariots mentioned in Zechariah 6:2-7 and the four horsemen in Revelation 6. Some believe these are related and to an extent they may be but care must be taken not to argue a case where Scripture is silent.# The number of different colours of horses mentioned in chapter 1 are three while in chapter 6 there are four.# Since the interpreting angel just ignores the colours, we can see the emphasis of the vision is on something else. We can speculate as to the meaning of the colours but we should take care not to be dogmatic.# Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;My lord, what are these?\u0026rdquo; Zechariah wants to know the meaning of the vision.# Zechariah 1:9b And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;I will show you what these are.\u0026rdquo; It is not the receptor\u0026rsquo;s task to interpret some vague dream. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows exactly what God is communicating. Rev 1:1, 2 Cor 10:5# Zechariah 1:10a And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, Zechariah hears the rider himself, the Angel of the Lord speaks.# Zechariah 1:10b \u0026ldquo;These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.\u0026rdquo; Evidently this angelic patrol sent to gather information regarding the current status of the earth.# Though Satan is the prince and power of the air and has been given authority over the earth it does not mean God is not in complete control and watching all things.# Zechariah 1:11a So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees The agents report back to the angel of the Lord of what they observed among the nations. The angel of the Lord will in turn report to the Father.# This is the same angel of the Lord who battled for Israel before and the King of Syria is forced to flee. Isa 37:36-37# The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 4 different times in Zechariah (Zech 1, 3, 6, 12). This “man among the myrtle trees” was the angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13).# Many scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead, the Son of God, who in Old Testament times makes temporary preincarnate appearances on earth.# Scripture records the angel of the Lord appearing to many people throughout history.# Hagar. Gen. 16:7–14# Abraham. Gen 18; 22:11–18# Jacob. Gen 31:11, 13# Moses. Ex. 3# Gideon. Judg. 6:11–23# Samson’s parents. Judg. 13# Joseph in a dream prior to the birth of Jesus. Matt 1:24# The ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy (the first vision) will be when the Messiah is seen wearing red making war against the nations. Rev 19:11-13# Zechariah 1:11b and said, \u0026ldquo;We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.\u0026rdquo; To the reader the initial thought might be, \u0026ldquo;Peace! All is well!\u0026rdquo;. The response by the angel of the Lord reflects things are far from right in order to be at peace.# There\u0026rsquo;s nothing wrong with peace as long as it is attained the right way. At this point in history, the gentile nations were at peace at the expense of God\u0026rsquo;s nation Israel. God has no regard for man\u0026rsquo;s way of peace apart from Him.# True, ultimate world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne from Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4# According to Scripture, peace does not come until Babylon is destroyed. Rev 17-18, Zech 5# Zechariah 1:12 Then the angel of the LORD said, \u0026ldquo;O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?\u0026rdquo; God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God, \u0026ldquo;how much longer are your people to suffer?\u0026rdquo; Jer 29:10# The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 17 extra years have passed and yet there\u0026rsquo;s still no temple, no city and it still lies unprotected and yet \u0026ldquo;the earth is peaceful and quiet\u0026rdquo;.# The nations were fine with Israel not having the autonomy of their God given land! Jer 29:10, Jer 6:14# The angel of the Lord\u0026rsquo;s words reflect his empathy for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are \u0026ldquo;at peace\u0026rdquo;.# The angel of the Lord intercedes before the Lord on behalf of the people. Zech 1:12# In a similar manner, Christ intercedes for the church today. 1 Joh 2:1, Heb 7:25, Rom 8:34# For centuries, “How long?” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel. Psa 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2# “How long?” is also the cry of the martyred saints in heaven as they await God to avenge them. Rev. 6:10# \u0026ldquo;How long\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Act 1:7# It was told to Daniel that Israel\u0026rsquo;s return would ultimately be 70 units of 7. This comes to a total of 490 years. These yet have to be fulfilled in their purpose. Dan 9:24-27# Finally, when Babylon (the personification of the kingdom of man throughout Scripture) is destroyed, then there will be peace. Isa 14:3-7# The greatest demonstration of God\u0026rsquo;s compassion is in the giving of His Son. He took upon Himself the sins of the world. Joh 3:16, Rom 5:8, 2 John 2:2, 2 Cor 5:21# Zechariah 1:13 The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the \u0026ldquo;interrogation\u0026rdquo; and responds with kind words. Col 4:6# Interestingly, the Lord\u0026rsquo;s answer is not to the angel of the Lord, rather it is directed at the interpreting angel to relate it to Zechariah.# God answered with compassion. One of the primary purposes of prophecy is always to encourage and give hope. To know you on the winning side is a source of comfort.# Zechariah 1:14a So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, \u0026ldquo;Proclaim, saying\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; This message is not to be kept hidden, it is to be announced. As a prophet Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate God\u0026rsquo;s message to the people. Heb 1:1-2# This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zech 1:12# Zechariah 1:14b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;I am exceedingly jealous\u0026hellip; The reader is reminded the Lord of hosts is far from indifferent of His nation.# This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it seemed God didn\u0026rsquo;t care or had somehow forgotten his promise.# God\u0026rsquo;s jealousy for Israel means that He has a strong desire for Israel. Isa 54:8, Heb 12:6-7# Zechariah 1:14c for Jerusalem and Zion. Many times in Scripture, Zion is synonymous with Jerusalem. Here, the use of Zion would bring up Davidic covenant terminology to the Jew. See first usage of Zion in 2 Samuel 5:7, 1 King 8:1# God has put his king (David) on mount Zion. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah\u0026rsquo;s throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psa 2:6, Zech 6:12-13# Zion is the mountain on which God\u0026rsquo;s house, the temple, stands. Mic 3:12# Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Mic 4:1, 3# A prophecy is given to \u0026ldquo;the daughter of Zion\u0026rdquo; regarding her king. This is fulfilled by Jesus who comes riding into the city on a donkey. Matt 21:4# Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Mic 4:2# Zechariah 1:15 \u0026ldquo;But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; God had been a little angry with Israel which lasted 70 years but is now very angry with the nations.# The Lord is very angry at the nations or being at ease while His people suffer for lack of their land that He himself had deeded to them. The nations did nothing about helping Judah, in fact, \u0026ldquo;they furthered the disaster.\u0026rdquo; They actively went against Israel. Zech 1:11, Jer 6:14# The Lord had also said this would happen and had even promised to punish the nations (specifically in this case the Chaldeans) for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1# Zechariah 1:16a \u0026lsquo;Therefore thus says the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion\u0026hellip; We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort.# Zechariah 1:16b My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo; After decades of the temple being demolished and the city pulverized, God\u0026rsquo;s favour of Israel will once again be visible when you see the temple rebuilt and Jerusalem a city where the borders are defined.# About 200 years earlier, God had announced through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this\u0026hellip;.\u0026ldquo;It is I who says of Cyrus, \u0026lsquo;He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.\u0026rsquo; And he declares of Jerusalem, \u0026lsquo;She will be built,\u0026rsquo; And of the temple, \u0026lsquo;Your foundation will be laid.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; Isa 44:28# Zechariah adds more information to Isaiah\u0026rsquo;s prophecy. It will be under Zerubbabel that the temple will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10# Zechariah 1:17a \u0026ldquo;Again, proclaim, saying, We see an example of how God speaks multiple times and in different ways so everyone has ample opportunity to hear what He is about to do. Isa 65:2, Rom 10:21# Zechariah 1:17b \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; The Lord of hosts (He who battles for them) is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zech 6:15# While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah\u0026rsquo;s time, verse 17 is clearly yet future since it has yet to happen.# Prophecy is always given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;you will know that I am the Lord\u0026rdquo; Ex 6:7# When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zech 13:9# When God makes the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Eze 36:11# When God shows himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Eze 36:23# When God rebuilds what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Eze 36:36.# When God fills the rebuilt cities with people. Eze 36:38.# When God brings back to life a people long dead. Eze 37:6.# When God opens their graves and brings his people up from them. Eze 37:13# When God puts his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Eze 37:14# When God\u0026rsquo;s sanctuary stands among them forever. Eze 37:28# When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Eze 38:23# When God finishes bringing his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Eze 39:28# There will never be complete peace on the earth until God\u0026rsquo;s purpose of rebuilding and establishing Israel as He promised will be accomplished. Jer 8:11, Rev 17:14# Only Jesus Christ will bring peace to the earth when the government is upon his shoulders in the millennial kingdom. This occurs after Babylon is destroyed. Isa 9:6-7, 2 Pet 3:13, Rev 17-19# Zechariah 1:18-21 The vision of four horns and four craftsmen# Zechariah 1:18 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns. Horns used this way, typically represent political powers, national leaders or nations. Psa 75:10, Jer 48:25, Dan 7:24, 8, Rev 12, 13, 17# Zechariah 1:19a So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these?\u0026rdquo; And he answered me, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; We aren\u0026rsquo;t given the identity of these horns except that they are nations. At least two main options exist.# Option 1: The four horns had already come. This could refer to the four nations (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) God used to scatter Judah. 2 King 24:2# Option 2: The four horns had begun but are not yet completed. The scattering is in reference to Judah. Babylon would be the first then Medo Persia then Greece were all guilty. The forth would be referring to Rome which in one way or another continues today. Jer 50:17-18, Eze 34:11-24# This option appears to be the most plausible option.# This option would also align with Daniel\u0026rsquo;s four horns. Dan 7# Zechariah 1:19b *Judah, Israel and Jerusalem\u0026hellip;*Is the order given important? Later these are summed up as Judah. Zech 1:21# Zechariah 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. The Lord was interested that Zechariah see the four craftsmen.# Craftsmen were skilled workers in metal or wood. Hos 13:2, 2 Chr 29:5# Zechariah 1:21 I said, \u0026ldquo;What are these coming to do?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it.\u0026rdquo; Even though the horns would scatter Judah, the four craftsmen would terrify these nations and throw them down.# This was to encourage the reader that though things seemed helpless, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord\u0026rsquo;s word to know who would ultimately have the last word.# Ultimately the demise of Rome (the fourth horn) is by the Craftsman that comes from heaven, the Rock not made with hands that destroys the whole statue. Dan 2# Zechariah 2:1-13 The vision of the measuring of Jerusalem# Zechariah 2:1 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. Zechariah then sees a man who had an instrument to measure in his hand.# Zechariah 2:2 So I said, \u0026ldquo;Where are you going?\u0026rdquo; And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is.\u0026rdquo; Zechariah asks where the man might be going.# In 586 BC, about 60 years earlier, the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. They took everyone exile except for the poorest of the land who eventually revolted against the man who was left in charge and they fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians. 2 King 24-25, Jer 39, 52, 2 Chr 36:17-21# Zechariah 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel.# Zechariah 2:4 and said to him, \u0026ldquo;Run, speak to that young man, saying, \u0026lsquo;Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. The other angel tells the interpreting angel to run and tell Zechariah about the future state of Jerusalem!# This is the explanation to the vision of the man who goes to measure Jerusalem. Zech 2:1-2# Back in the first vision God had said, \u0026ldquo;I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.\u0026rdquo; Zech 1:16# Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be rebuilt with the temple in her midst and the city filled with multitudes of men and livestock would have been of great encouragement! This would indeed promote initiative for the rebuilding of the temple. Zech 9:12# Without hope it is very difficult to begin a new endeavor. Hope allows one to \u0026ldquo;see\u0026rdquo; the good in the future even perhaps, despite difficult times in the present in order to press onward. 1 Tim 4:10, 1 Tim 5:5, 1 Jn 3:3# Zechariah 2:5-13 The Lord Jesus Christ foretells He will be sent by the Lord of Hosts to the world. He will dwell in the midst of Israel once again and the nations will attach themselves to her.# Zechariah 2:5 \u0026lsquo;For I,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD, \u0026lsquo;will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; the Lord here is Christ. He himself says He will be the source of glory from within and the impenetrable protecting wall of fire around the city. Zeph 3:15, Luk 2:25-32, Mat 25:31,# Zechariah 2:6 \u0026ldquo;Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. Though this dispersion was caused originally by the Assyrians, this return is referring to the end times. Jer 3:18# Zechariah 2:7 \u0026ldquo;Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon.\u0026rdquo; Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem.# Two religious entities are contrasted here. Zion and daughter of Babylon. The daugher of Zion refers to those Israelites who put their trust in God while the daughter of Babylon is the Chaldean system of religion. Isa 47, Psa 137:8, Rev 17# This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel which continues on until the end of man\u0026rsquo;s rule. Rev 17:5# Zechariah 2:8a For thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you\u0026hellip; God sends the Lord against the nations to bring about glory. Psa 2# God\u0026rsquo;s sent one is none other than God, the Lord of hosts himself.# Zechariah 2:8b for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. God is deeply devoted over His possession, Israel. He who touches the apple of His eye (Israel), goes against the very Lord of hosts! Deut 32:9-10# The Church is also God\u0026rsquo;s cherished possession. Christ paid a very high cost to redeem her. He laid down his very life for her. 1 Pet 1:18-19# Zechariah 2:9a \u0026ldquo;For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. God will turn everything around. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately shatter them like earthenware and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psa 2, Psa 110# Zechariah 2:9b Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. This phrase appears 4 times in Zechariah. God is always communicating in a way so that Scripture\u0026rsquo;s fulfillment is literal and so that everyone knows it\u0026rsquo;s as He said it would be. Acts 2:36# Zechariah is foretelling about God sending His Son to the world. Psa 2:7, Rom 1:1-4, Gal 4:4, 1 Jn 4:9-10, Jn 3:16# Since the beginning of time, one truth at a time, God progressively revealed His plan to send a deliverer. One who would make all things right again. People have been placing their trust in this hope since then.# Genesis 3:15 - Deliverance would come through a man, born of a woman.# Leviticus 1:4 - He would provide atonement.# Zechariah 3:8-10 - He would provide forgiveness of sins# Deuteronomy 18:15 - He would be a prophet.# Psalm 2:7 - He would be declared the Son of God# Micah 5:2 - He would be born in Bethlehem of Judea.# Isaiah 7:14 - He would be born of a virgin.# 2 Samuel 7:12-13 - He would be heir to David\u0026rsquo;s throne. Psa 2:6, Zech 9:9# Isaiah 53:5-12 - He would be the sacrifice for sins.# Zechariah 11:12-13 - He would be betrayed by his own for 30 pieces of silver.# Zechariah 12:10 - He would be pierced through and looked upon.# Zechariah 13:7 - He would be stricken and his followers would scatter.# Daniel 7:13-14 He would return a second time.# Zechariah 9:9 - The first time he would come riding on a donkey.# Mark 13:26 - The second time in great power and glory riding on a white horse. Rev 19:11-18# Zechariah 6:12 - He would rebuild the temple.# Zechariah 6:13 - He would be both priest and king.# Zechariah 9:9-10 - He would be a peaceful king.# Zechariah 14:4 - He would set his feet down on Mount Olives.# Zechariah 14:9 - He would be king of all the earth.# Zechariah 14:16 - He would be worshipped as king by the nations.# Zechariah 8:3 - He would bring truth. Joh 4:25-26# King David was filled with hope knowing one day the Redeemer would rise from the dead. His hope was in the Lord. Acts 2:25-31, 24:15, Psa 110:1# Against all hope, Abraham hoped (believed) in the coming Savior. Rom 4, Joh 8:56# Isaiah prophesied that one day we Gentiles would one day place their hope in Messiah. Rom 15:12, Mat 12:21# We are saved in hope of the promises of God which is a sure thing to all those who believe the Gospel. Heb 11:1, Rom 8:24-25, 2 Cor 1:10, Gal 5:5, Eph 4:4, Col 1:5, Tit 1:2# To place faith in Jesus Christ essentially means to place one\u0026rsquo;s hope in who He is and what he\u0026rsquo;s done and his promises to all who believe. Eph 1:12, Eph 1:18, Col 1:5, Col 1:23, Tit 1:2, Tit 3:7# Christ himself is our hope. This hope is a sure thing not dependent upon our good behavior but on his completed and accepted work of the cross. 1 Tim 1:1, Tit 2:13, 1 Pet 1:3# As believers we can abound in hope as we walk by faith. Rom 15:13, Col 1:27, Heb 10:23, 1 Pet 1:13, 1 Tim 4:10, Heb 6:18-20# Zechariah 2:10 \u0026ldquo;Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. The Lord himself, the Son of God will dwell in her midst. Joh 1:14,# Though Jesus did come and bodily dwelt in Israel, the ultimate, eternal fulfillment of this is during the Messianic reign. Rev 21:3, Isa 9:6-7# Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast with the daughter of Babylon.# Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. To know they are one the winning side was an encouraging truth to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zech 9:9# Zechariah 2:11a \u0026ldquo;Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Clearly a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel\u0026rsquo;s rule.# About 20 references of \u0026ldquo;in that day\u0026rdquo; are found in Zechariah.# When God returns and comforts Jerusalem.# When God defends the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Zech 12:6# When God will destroy the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zech 12:3, 9# When God will remove all idolatry from the land. Zech 13:2# When Messiah stands on the mount of Olives. He will reign over all the earth from Zion. Zech 14:4, 9# Zechariah 2:11b Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ will one day dwell in their midst forever. The Lord of hosts will send the Lord to them. Joh 1:11, 14# Zechariah 2:12 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present God has placed His program with them on hold. In the day of the Lord though, God will once again work directly in and through Israel. Deut 32:9, Jer 7:7, Rom 11:11-12, 25# Zechariah 2:13 \u0026ldquo;Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation.\u0026rdquo; God is angered at the current situation and laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple.# Zechariah 3:1-10 The vision of Joshua the high priest# Zechariah 3:1 Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. We see here a picture of what is constantly occurring. Satan constantly accuses while the angel of the Lord (Christ) is seen interceding.# This is true today during the church age as well and will continue until all access to heaven is taken away from Satan when the Day of the Lord begins and Satan is thrown to remain on earth until the end of the Millennium where he is thrown into the lake of fire forever.# Zechariah 3:2 The LORD said to Satan, \u0026ldquo;The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Satan\u0026rsquo;s limits are stated regarding Jerusalem. God had chosen it and the angel of the Lord (Christ) calls for the Lord (God the Father) to rebuke Satan.# Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?\u0026rdquo; Though the people are guilty and deserving of eternal condemnation, God delivered them. Amo 4:11# Brand is the word UD meaning to take together as in the case of raking embers together.# Plucked is the word NATSAL meaning to snatch away, deliver, rescue, save, strip, plunder.# We too are like embers plucked from the fire. Colossians 1:13# Zechariah 3:3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. Zechariah saw filthy garments on Joshua, evidence of Joshua\u0026rsquo;s guilt.# Here Joshua as high priest is symbolic of the people\u0026rsquo;s condition before God.# Zechariah 3:4a He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, \u0026ldquo;Remove the filthy garments from him.\u0026rdquo; At the command of the angel of the Lord, the dirty garments are removed. Jude 1:24, 1 John 2:2# Zechariah 3:4b Again he said to him, \u0026ldquo;See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes.\u0026rdquo; Joshua is told his iniquity (dirty garments) has been removed. He will be clothed in garments of rejoicing. Rom 4:7-8# The filthy garments are the priest\u0026rsquo;s guilt. Even man\u0026rsquo;s righteous deeds are like a filthy garment. Isa 64:6# It is the angel of the Lord who removes any iniquity. This, obviously on the basis of his successful work of the cross! Rom 3:24-26# Through faith in the finished, substitutionary work of Christ, God removes our filthy garments and gives us festal robes. Isa 61:10, Rev 7:9, Rev 22:14# One day, all of Israel will be saved. They will have their sins removed and reestablished in a right standing with God. Dan 9:24-27# This means though the priests were guilty, they have received forgiveness through their faith in Messiah. One day the Jewish priests will be believers.# Zechariah 3:5a Then I said, \u0026ldquo;Let them put a clean turban on his head.\u0026rdquo; So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, Zechariah is moved and adds that the turban be replaced for a clean one. The tunic was part of the high priestly garments commanded by God. Ex 28:4, Lev 8:9# Zechariah 3:5b while the angel of the LORD was standing by. He is standing right there making sure the changing of clothes takes place. One day this very angel of the Lord (Christ himself) would take on humanity and in place of man take on the role of sacrificial lamb, taking on the sins of mankind and paying the necessary price for man\u0026rsquo;s redemption. Amazing grace how sweet the sound!# Zechariah 3:6 And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,# Zechariah 3:7a \u0026ldquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026lsquo;If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,# Zechariah 3:7b then you will also govern My house\u0026hellip; God gave the priests the privilege to govern the temple if they walked in His ways. Eze 44:15-16# Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27# Instead of walking by faith in their God-given duties as priests, they not only created laws to protect the Mosaic law but they themselves failed to keep them, and abused the privileges God gave them. Rom 2:16-3:8# Zechariah 3:7c and also have charge of My courts, The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests were also placed to administer the courts. Later we find they abused this privilege and lost any authority. Matt 21:12# Zechariah 3:7d and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here. The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. This was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. Eze 45:4# In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 2:5# Zechariah 3:8a \u0026lsquo;Now listen, Joshua the high priest, Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.# Zechariah 3:8b you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, you and your friends - friends here symbolize all the priests.# Zechariah 3:8c for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a truly righteous servant. Isa 11:1, 60:21, Jer 23:5, 33:15, Zech 6:12# Zechariah 3:9a *\u0026lsquo;For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua\u0026hellip;*The high priestly uniform had 12 stones on the chest. Gen 49:24, Psa 118:22# Zechariah 3:9b on one stone are seven eyes\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 3:9c Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 3:9d \u0026lsquo;and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day\u0026hellip;# Zechariah 3:10a \u0026lsquo;In that day,\u0026rsquo; declares the LORD of hosts, that day refers to the day of the Lord when God will set all things straight with the nations, with Israel and establish His Kingdom.# That day appears in 25 verses in Zechariah, making us understand it is an important topic in the book.# Zechariah 3:10b \u0026rsquo;every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; For each person to have a vine and at least one fig tree# Zechariah 4:1-14 The vision of the two olive trees.# This vision is continued or somehow connected with the previous vision. While Joshua is a type of Messiah from a religious perspective, Zerubbabel is a type of Messiah in a political sense.# Who was Zerubbabel?# Heir to Davidic throne. 1 Chr 3:17-19# He cannot become king because of the curse on Coniah. Jer 22:28-30, Mat 1:11-16# Zerubbabel is more concerned about God\u0026rsquo;s approval than his legal right.# Zerubbabel was chosen as governor to lead the first return of the people (about 50 thousand) to the land. Ezr 2:2, Neh 7:7# Zechariah 4:1 Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. Evidently Zechariah is to be wide awake to make sure he sees the following vision.# Zechariah 4:2 He said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; Zechariah is asked to describe what he sees. It is a golden lampstand with the bowl for oil on top of it.# Zechariah as priest would have been familiar with the lampstand.# Zechariah 4:3 also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side.\u0026rdquo; This lampstand is also different from the lampstand in the temple/tabernacle. The lampstand in the tabernacle had to have its oil replenished. This lampstand has a never ending source of oil (the two olive trees) to keep the lampstand burning. No human hands have to touch this lampstand to give forth its light.# The lampstand serves as a reminder of God\u0026rsquo;s presence.# Zechariah 4:4 Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:5 So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:6 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, \u0026lsquo;Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,\u0026rsquo; says the LORD of hosts. From Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s perspective right now, he sees the rebuilding of the temple as an impossible task. He has the greatest obstacle of the people doing it in their own power.# God declares it will be done by divine power not by Zerubbabel\u0026rsquo;s power.# God\u0026rsquo;s power able to accomplish what God asks is a constant theme in Scripture# Exodus 14:14 \u0026ldquo;The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent.\u0026rdquo;# Psalm 46:10-11 \u0026ldquo;Cease striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.\u0026rdquo; The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.# Zechariah 4:7 \u0026lsquo;What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of \u0026ldquo;Grace, grace to it!\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo; The completion of the temple will come with a cry of joy!# This will be a joyful response to God\u0026rsquo;s power and faithfulness. Hag 1:13, 2:4# In this same way, we should be encouraged because God is with us as we walk by the Spirit.# Zechariah 4:8 Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,# Zechariah 4:9 \u0026ldquo;The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it. For Zerubbabel to know he will finish it, would be very encouraging news.# Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. The near fulfillment of this confirms the future fulfillment.# Literal fulfillment of prophecy is the only way you can be assured the prophecy is fulfilled! Interpreting prophecy in an allegorical manner never confidently concludes knowing the Lord of hosts did it.# Zechariah 4:10a \u0026ldquo;For who has despised the day of small things? The despised day refers to the time when the temple was completed and some were sorrowful. Some still remembered Solomon\u0026rsquo;s temple and this temple in comparison is not quite as elaborate. Hag 2:3# Some could not look beyond the past and see the Messianic future by faith.# Zechariah 4:10b But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth.\u0026rdquo; Though many are disappointed, the Lord rejoiced because of the temple.# Because they had returned to Him, He will return to them through the simbolism of his presence in the temple.# Zechariah 4:11 Then I said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:12 And I answered the second time and said to him, \u0026ldquo;What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:13 So he answered me, saying, \u0026ldquo;Do you not know what these are?\u0026rdquo; And I said, \u0026ldquo;No, my lord.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 4:14 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth.\u0026rdquo;# Who are these two?# Option 1: Joshua and Zerubbabel# Option 2: Two offices of Messiah# Biblical Thoughts:# Light to the gentiles# John 1 - Jesus is the light of the world - so that all might believe through him# Exodus 19:5 - you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (manifesting the light of God to the world).# Isaiah 60:1 - shine for your light has come\u0026hellip;nations will come\u0026hellip;# The Church Ephesians 5:7 - were darkness, now you are light\u0026hellip;walk as children of light. You are light in Christ.# When we walk in the reality of who we are in Christ, we reflect the light of Christ. Our responsibility is not the results but to reflect the character of Christ. (trying to learn).# we are not the light source. we reflect the Light.# Future manifestation of light:# Rev 11:3 - two witnesses. Two olive trees. Give off light. Testimony of light during tribulation.# Zechariah 5:1-4 The vision of a flying scroll# Zechariah 5:1 Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll.# Zechariah 5:2 And he said to me, \u0026ldquo;What do you see?\u0026rdquo; And I answered, \u0026ldquo;I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.\u0026rdquo;# This could be referring to the single scroll Jeremiah wrote. Jer 51:60# Zechariah 5:3 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.# Zechariah 5:4 \u0026ldquo;I will make it go forth,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts,# In this particular instance, we not only see God\u0026rsquo;s omniscience but his actual causing of future events.# Zechariah 5:4b \u0026ldquo;and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones.\u0026rdquo;# \u0026ldquo;The thief\u0026rdquo; here, may be referring to the commercial aspect of Babylon while \u0026ldquo;the one who swears falsely by My name\u0026rdquo; my refer to the religious.# Zechariah 5:5-11 The vision of the Ephah# Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, \u0026ldquo;Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:6 I said, \u0026ldquo;What is it?\u0026rdquo; And he said, \u0026ldquo;This is the ephah going forth.\u0026rdquo; Again he said, \u0026ldquo;This is their appearance in all the land# An Ephah is a Hebrew unit of measurement for grain. Lev 5:11, Ruth 2:17# Perhaps it is connected here with commerce. Lev 19:36# Zechariah 5:7 (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:8 Then he said, \u0026ldquo;This is Wickedness!\u0026rdquo; And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. The woman within the ephah is probably idolatrous Babylon that has influenced the whole world. Rev 17:1, 5, 18, Zech 5:11# Zechariah 5:9 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.# The two women with wings of a stork could refer to the speed in which it is taken.# Zechariah 5:10 I said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;Where are they taking the ephah?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 5:11 Then he said to me, \u0026ldquo;To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal.\u0026rdquo;# The land of Shinar (or Sumer) was where the first world-wide religion was, known as the tower of Babel or Babil. Gen 10:10, Gen 11:1-9# Nimrod built the city of Babel right after the flood. Gen 10:10, Mic 5:2-6# Babel (confusion) and is also translated Babylon in Greek.# Babel/Babylon is always seen in a negative light in Scripture. Jer 51:7# It will ultimately be totally destroyed by God. Isa 13:1, Isa 13:19, Isa 21:9, Jer 51:11, 24, 44, Jer 50:46# Babylon was not destroyed like God said He would do. 1 Pet 5:13 Babylon is currently being rebuilt.# At the time of this writing, the US is currently building its largest embassy ((104 acres)) in bagdad, 50 miles from Babylon.# The destruction of Babylon occurs near the end of the tribulation. Rev 17-18.# Zechariah 6:1-15 The vision of four chariots# Zechariah 6:1 Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains. Deut 8:9, Zech 14:1-5# Zechariah 6:2 With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses,.. a chariot (merkabah) is a weapon of war. Merkava, Israel\u0026rsquo;s main battle tank.# Zechariah 6:3 with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.# Revelation 6 mentions the same colours in a different order. John would have thought of this vision possibly.# White horse - victory# Red Horse - bloodshed of war# Black horse - economic disaster# Ashen horse - caos, death, instability# Zechariah 6:4 Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, \u0026ldquo;What are these, my lord?\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 6:5 The angel replied to me, \u0026ldquo;These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, Josh 3:11, 13, Mic 4:13# Zechariah 6:6 with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. The red horses aren\u0026rsquo;t going anywhere.

They are eager to go appease God\u0026rsquo;s wrath specifically in the land of the north.# Zechariah 6:8 Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, \u0026ldquo;See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.\u0026rdquo;# Zechariah 6:9 The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,# Zechariah 6:10 \u0026ldquo;Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. These men may be metal smiths.# Zechariah 6:11 \u0026ldquo;Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.# Zechariah 6:12 \u0026ldquo;Then say to him, \u0026lsquo;Thus says the LORD of hosts, \u0026ldquo;Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. Messiah will do this.# Zechariah 6:13 \u0026ldquo;Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.\u0026rdquo;\u0026rsquo;# Zechariah 6:14 \u0026ldquo;Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.# Zechariah 6:15 \u0026ldquo;Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD.\u0026rdquo; Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.

Woe to the inhabitants of the seacoast, The nation of the Cherethites! The word of the LORD is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; And I will destroy you So that there will be no inhabitant. So the seacoast will be pastures, With caves for shepherds and folds for flocks. And the coast will be For the remnant of the house of Judah, They will pasture on it. In the houses of Ashkelon they will lie down at evening; For the LORD their God will care for them And restore their fortune. \u0026ldquo;I have heard the taunting of Moab And the revilings of the sons of Ammon, With which they have taunted My people And become arrogant against their territory. \u0026ldquo;Therefore, as I live,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD of hosts, The God of Israel, \u0026ldquo;Surely Moab will be like Sodom And the sons of Ammon like Gomorrah—A place possessed by nettles and salt pits, And a perpetual desolation. The remnant of My people will plunder them And the remainder of My nation will inherit them.\u0026rdquo; This they will have in return for their pride, because they have taunted and become arrogant against the people of the LORD of hosts. The LORD will be terrifying to them, for He will starve all the gods of the earth; and all the coastlands of the nations will bow down to Him, everyone from his own place. \u0026ldquo;You also, O Ethiopians, will be slain by My sword.\u0026rdquo; And He will stretch out His hand against the north And destroy Assyria, And He will make Nineveh a desolation, Parched like the wilderness. Flocks will lie down in her midst, All beasts which range in herds; Both the pelican and the hedgehog Will lodge in the tops of her pillars; Birds will sing in the window, Desolation will be on the threshold; For He has laid bare the cedar work. This is the exultant city Which dwells securely, Who says in her heart, \u0026ldquo;I am, and there is no one besides me.\u0026rdquo; How she has become a desolation, A resting place for beasts! Everyone who passes by her will hiss And wave his hand in contempt. Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled, The tyrannical city! She heeded no voice, She accepted no instruction. She did not trust in the LORD, She did not draw near to her God. Her princes within her are roaring lions, Her judges are wolves at evening; They leave nothing for the morning. Her prophets are reckless, treacherous men; Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law. The LORD is righteous within her; He will do no injustice. Every morning He brings His justice to light; He does not fail. But the unjust knows no shame. \u0026ldquo;I have cut off nations; Their corner towers are in ruins. I have made their streets desolate, With no one passing by; Their cities are laid waste, Without a man, without an inhabitant. \u0026ldquo;I said, \u0026lsquo;Surely you will revere Me, Accept instruction.\u0026rsquo; So her dwelling will not be cut off According to all that I have appointed concerning her.

Indeed, My decision is to gather nations, To assemble kingdoms, To pour out on them My indignation, All My burning anger; For all the earth will be devoured By the fire of My zeal. \u0026ldquo;For then I will give to the peoples purified lips, That all of them may call on the name of the LORD, To serve Him shoulder to shoulder. \u0026ldquo;From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia My worshipers, My dispersed ones, Will bring My offerings. \u0026ldquo;In that day you will feel no shame Because of all your deeds By which you have rebelled against Me; For then I will remove from your midst Your proud, exulting ones, And you will never again be haughty On My holy mountain. \u0026ldquo;But I will leave among you A humble and lowly people, And they will take refuge in the name of the LORD. \u0026ldquo;The remnant of Israel will do no wrong And tell no lies, Nor will a deceitful tongue Be found in their mouths; For they will feed and lie down With no one to make them tremble.\u0026rdquo; Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion!
