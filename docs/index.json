      "content":"https://www.biblestudytools.com/bible-study/topical-studies/what-is-the-church-according-to-the-bible.html What Is the Church? It\u0026rsquo;s Role and Purpose According to the Bible Pastor Luis Ángel Díaz-Pabón October 22, 2019\nWhat Is the Church?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Role and Purpose According to the Bible “Church” is the translation of the Greek term ekklesia, and is used in the New Testament to identify the community of believers in Jesus Christ. It literally means “assembly,” “congregation,” or “meeting.” A similar term was used in the Old Testament referring to experiences such as “the day of the assembly,” “the Lord’s congregation,” or “meeting before the Lord.”\nThus, when Jesus declares: “I will build my church” (Mt 16:18), it did not come as something unfamiliar to the common listener. Shortly after, in the New Testament, the word is confined strictly to refer to the congregation of believers in Jesus Christ.\nIt is worth mentioning that in the New Testament, no synagogue, temple, chapel, tabernacle, building or any other meeting place was ever called a “church.” The term always referred to the Christian assembly and, in the New Testament, it was used for both the local community of believers and the overall collection of Christians.\nLocal vs Universal\nThe first sense for which the word “church” is used, what we call “local,” is defined by its geographical setting. The churches in the New Testament were identified by the name of a city, never by the name of a country or region. For example, one would speak of “the churches of Galatia” in plural because Galatia was a region with many cities, and therefore, many local churches. When talking about Corinth, Ephesus, Thessalonica, etc., the singular form is used and the name of the city identifies the church. For example, the church in Corinth or the church in Ephesus; each one of these churches was comprised of the Christian residents of the same city.\nThe second sense, called “universal,” refers to the collection of believers in Jesus Christ from all times and places. This church consists of both Jews and Gentiles. The first meeting of the universal church will occur during the rapture: “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the archangel’s voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord” (1Th 4:16-17). This will be an unprecedented event. All that we have believed and loved, seeing only from a distance, will be a tangible reality. Until then, we rely on the local expression in order to experience communion. This is our immediate family in the faith. The local church differs only in size from the universal, but not in essence. The nature of the local church and God’s commitment to it are the same as those of the universal church.\nWho builds the church?\nJesus declared that building or edifying the church is something He would do personally. He said: “I will build my church” (Mt 16:18), but that does not mean that He will not also use others for the task. One of the most well-known metaphors used to refer to the church is the “body of Christ.” Jesus Christ states that He is the head, and that all believers form His body. The emphasis of the metaphor is on the union of Christ and the church and between the believers themselves—some- thing indispensable to the understanding of how the church functions under the authority of Jesus Christ.\nAccording to Paul, every believer has a function in the church, just as the different parts of a body have a specific function. The idea of a group of clergy taking responsibility for all Christian ministry while a mass of laypeople simply receive the benefits is totally foreign to Scripture. Bishops, elders, pastors, deacons, and new believers are simply members of the body of Christ with distinct responsibilities and roles, according to the maturity and gifts of each one. A believer that behaves like Diotrephes in 3 John (who takes ownership of the local church, believing himself to be the maximum authority) usurps the place of Christ.\nWhat is the role of the local church?\nTherefore, the ministerial responsibility of the local church falls upon the members as a whole. As the members identify their gifts and take on the responsibility of administering them under the leading of the Holy Spirit, the church increases its capacity to bless and to fulfill its mission on earth.\nSome have identified the condition of the modern church as the “80/20 syndrome”: a small percentage of the members (20 percent) take on the responsibility of ministerial work, while the other 80 percent are mere spectators.\nOthers have pointed out that with each passing day, the church is more and more like a football game where, from the stands, a crowd observes a small number of players who offer a great show. Those that put forth an effort on the field urgently need rest, whereas the spectators desperately need to exercise. This image illustrates the reality of the church. The crowd of believers that fills our temples and chapels each Sunday must discover how useful and necessary they are in the divine plan of evangelization and the building of the body of Christ.\nWhat was the church like in the New Testament?\nThe church that we see in the New Testament is dynamic. Never a prisoner of buildings, we see the church meeting in the temple, in a synagogue, in the street, beside the sea, in public places, and often in homes. Acts describes a community of faith in constant movement:\n“Every day they devoted them- selves to meeting together in the temple, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Every day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved” (Ac 2:46-47).\nIt appears that the meetings were daily, and definitely not monotonous. Worship, fraternal communion, prayer, working in mutual edification, giving testimony of Christ, and taking care of the needs of the poor were not part of special programs, but rather everyday activities. Those that observed the believers’ way of life called them people of “the Way”—surely due to their constant action, their defined doctrine, and because they could always be seen going from one place to another.\nWhat is the future of the church?\nThe future of the Lord’s church is a glorious one. The church will not only be victorious in heaven, but here on earth as well. By taking another look at Matthew 16:18, we see that it refers to the church when it says “and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.” Jesus’s statement here does not present a small and fearful group of timid believers. On the contrary, it shows a vigorous and bold church, capable of coming out victorious in any circumstance, including death.\nWhen Jesus presents the church as triumphant, even against the gates of Hades, we should see Satan and all his demons defeated by the work of the cross, and representing no threat for the future of the church. Those that form part of the church belong to the winning team and should speak and act as such.\nThe future of the church was established on the mission statement in Matthew 28:19: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations . . .” The verse does not invite us to make disciples “in” the nations but “of” the nations. The church must disciple the nations. As it advances, it teaches the nations how to live. The church carries out the work of discipleship just by existing in the world. Of course, this places an enormous weight of responsibility on the shoulders of every believer, as it assumes that their lives are to be an example and inspiration to humanity.\nIn Ephesians 5:26-27, Paul declares that Jesus gave Himself up for the church, “to make her holy, cleansing her with the washing of water by the word. He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless.” Our God has not failed in any of His endeavors, nor will He fail in this one. The church was designed to be holy and blameless. With this goal Christ gave Himself up, and with this goal His workers are to carry out their work. There is no reason to believe that we will not achieve this goal. We can affirm that the future of the church will be glorious.\nWhat does God say about the present church?\nWhen we say that the future of the church is glorious, we affirm that the same is true in the present. Today, the church is exactly what God stated: the house of God, the pillar and foundation of the truth, God’s temple, His body, a chosen people, a holy priesthood and, regardless of the circumstances that it faces, it will continue being everything that God said it is.\nIn Ephesians 3:10, Paul explains what is currently happening with the church, “so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.” We cannot fully understand the greatness of the church. For centuries, God kept hidden this marvelous mystery. That which was revealed to Paul and others is so extraordinary that even the angels watch what is taking place attentively. The love of the Lord for His church leaves everyone speechless. God desired to bring Jews and Gentiles together into one people: the church. This is not easy for those who expect everyone to unite under the Jews in order to come to God. Jesus Christ came to earth and gave up His life to save us.\nThis must be admirable to the angels, who saw a good portion of their own fall with no possibility for redemption. Since the Old Testament, the angels have shown curiosity towards this reality, but only recently, and through the church, has God instructed everyone and His wisdom been fully expressed. This scene seems to describe the angels that watch the expression of divine love towards the church from a celestial balcony and, in admiration, are able to understand the wisdom of God like never before. This knowledge should leave us breathless, with tears of thankfulness and a profound sensation of admiration and humility as we see ourselves as a privileged part of the divine plan. Glory to God in the church today and for all of eternity!\n"},{

Gen 2:1\nAngels were created by God. The question is when?\nMy contention is that the angels had to be created during the six days although the Bible doesn\u0026rsquo;t say explicitly which day.\n\u0026ldquo;For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy. Ex 20:11\nLucifer is said to have been created on a day\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;You were blameless in your ways From the day you were created Until unrighteousness was found in you. Ezekiel 28:15\nTo say the angels were created before the six says clearly goes directly against Exodus 20:11.\n\u0026ldquo;For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.\nThe whole point of resting on day 7 (a literal day) is because God created everything in heaven and on earth in six literal days.\nbut the seventh day is a sabbath of the LORD your God; in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with you. Exodus 20:10\nThe verse that people use to say angels were already created before day one is in Job 38.\n\u0026ldquo;Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell Me, if you have understanding, who set its measurements? Since you know. Or who stretched the line on it? \u0026ldquo;On what were its bases sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone, when the morning stars sang together And all the sons of God shouted for joy? Job 38:4-7\nThe foundation of the earth could be understood as the whole week of creation as Genesis 2 concludes the earth was created in a day (a period of time).\nThis is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made earth and heaven. Gen 2:4\nThe foundation of the earth could easily refer to a period of time not the specific forming of the earth\u0026rsquo;s matter on day one or the appearing of dry land on day three.\nThen God said, \u0026ldquo;Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear\u0026rdquo;; and it was so. Genesis 1:9\nThe Job passage could be a reference to the angels observing the appearing of dry land on day three or seeing the creation of the earth\u0026rsquo;s matter in day one. Either would fit perfectly.\nIt would seem best to conclude that angels were created on or after day one but no later than day three with the appearing of dry land.\nWhen did the angels fall?# First off, at least Lucifer still has access to heaven. He will not be prohibited all access until during the Tribulation. But, when did the angels rebel against God? Was it before man sinned? Was it after or was at the same point in time?\nOne thing to keep in mind is that death came into the world when Adam sinned not when Lucifer rebelled. There was not death before Adam\u0026rsquo;s sin.\n"},{

This road stretched from Egypt in the south to Babylon in Mesopotamia, linking the major empires and trade routes of the day. Megiddo\u0026rsquo;s position on this highway made it a prime mercantile city. Whoever controlled Megiddo controlled access to trade all along this road. Megiddo was a choke point, therefore, for the empires of the ancient world. Control of Megiddo was crucial to controlling any regional empire. 1\nMegiddo as a city went into decline during the Babylonian and Persian periods. However, in modern times the site continued to see battles. Both Napoleon (1799) and the British General Allenby (1918) defeated Turkish forces here. The area has never lost its significance as a battleground for control over this crucial crossroad of empires.1\nRev 16:14 for they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.\nRev 16:15 (\u0026ldquo;Behold, I am coming like a thief.

      "content":"Biblical Convenants# Establishing a preliminary understanding# In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the biblical covenants, we will take a step back and see the general usage and importance of the term \u0026ldquo;covenant\u0026rdquo;.# Although we have many external sources (i.e. dictionaries, archaeological data, lexicons, historical records) that help us acquire a better understanding, we will not go to those first.# 2. A Scriptural principle: If the topic is to be considered important within the teaching of Scripture, the Bible will provide us sufficient usage and background to gain a sufficient understanding of that particular topic.# B. Establishing the importance of the word Covenant# 1. The word covenant shows up 281 times in the Old Testament (BERITH - Hebrew) and 33 times in the New Testament (DIATHEKE - Greek). This word appears all the way from Genesis to Revelation.# a. In the Old Testament (BERITH): 27 times in Genesis, 13 times in Exodus, 10 times in Leviticus, 5 times in Numbers, 27 times in Deuteronomy, 22 Times in Joshua, 5 times in Judges, 14 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Samuel, 26 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Kings, 30 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Chronicles, 1 time in Ezra, 4 times in Nehemiah, 3 times in Job, 21 times in Psalms, 1 time in proverbs, 12 times in Isaiah, 24 times in Jeremiah, 18 times in Ezekiel, 7 times in Daniel, 5 times in Hosea, 1 time in Amos, 1 time in Obadiah, 2 times in Zechariah and 6 times in Malachi.# b. In the New Testament (DIATHEKE): 1 time in Matthew, 1 time in Mark, 2 times in Luke, 2 times in Acts, 1 time in Romans, 3 times in 1 \u0026amp; 2 Corinthians, 2 times in Galatians, 21 times in Hebrews and 1 time in Revelation.# 1) Jesus is quoted using the term at least 5 times.# a) Though these quotes are referencing the same event, it is of interest that several different writers of the NT quote him speaking of a covenant, it gives us a clue it must be an important topic.# c. These and many observations more warrant a deeper study on the word covenant and its meaning.# C. Establishing the meaning of the word covenant# 1. What is the first Scriptural mention of the word?# a. The first appearance of the word is in Genesis (Gen 6:18)# 1) God initiates and promises Noah he will establish (ratify) a “covenant” with him# 2) God promises it here but it is not Ratified until after the flood and its fulfillment is ongoing# a) ‘A new beginning’ (compare Gen 9:3 and Gen 1:29-30)# 3) God’s promises to Noah, his descendants and to all flesh (Gen 9:9ff)# a) No negotiations took place# b) Universal# c) Unconditional# d) Had a sign (rainbow) to remind God of his promise to all flesh# e) everlasting# 4) The Noahic covenant sets a pattern for other covenants# a) God first makes a promise to someone of establishing a covenant.# b) This is conditioned upon a response of faith.# c) God then establishes the terms of the covenant and ratifies it.# d) Though the covenant goes into effect immediately, the fulfillment of the covenant may be postponed.# 2. Usage of the word - we see the term used in a great deal of ways.# a. Covenants among men# 1) Abimelech and Isaac (Gen 26:26-31)# 2) Joshua and the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:15)# a) God had said not to make covenants with the land (Deut 7:2, Judg 2:2)# 3) Solomon and Hiram (1 Kings 5:12)# 4) David and Jonathan (1 Samuel 20:3, 1 Samuel 20:16-17)# 5) Marriage (Mal 2:14)# 6) Threshold covenant# a) The threshold seems to be the separation of a dwelling from the outside world.# b) It was an insult to set something on the threshold (1 Sam 5:4-5)# c) God has made Jerusalem his threshold (translated cup) therefore is indignant of those trampling on her (Zech 1:9)# 7) Antichrist will make a covenant with ‘the many’ (Dan 9:27, 2 Thess. 2:3-4, Matt 24:15)# a) Daniel 9:27 - The tribulation begins with a ‘deal with the many for 7 years’ and ends in complete destruction# i) 7 years long\nii) Firm (with many). This covenant is made by him and broken when he changes his mind. He shows no regard for covenant keeping.\niii) Within 42 months, temple service is stopped (abomination of desolation) by him\nb. God makes covenants with people# 1) The purpose of this study is mostly concerned with this aspect of these covenants.# a) God’s covenant with Adam (part 1) - Hosea 6:7 - Possibly Adam here should be translated men, however by implication it does seem that a relationship of trust was set up originally . The word covenant does not appear in Genesis 1-3 but does not mean God did not set up a conditional agreement in the beginning, that is clear. (Gen 1:26-30).# b) God’s covenant with Adam (part 2)# i) This would refer to a covenant set up with Adam.\nc) God’s covenant to Cain (Gen 4:15)# d) God’s covenant with Noah, his descendants and all flesh (Gen 9:9-17)# e) God’s covenant with Abram (Gen 12:1-3, 15:18-21, 17:2-21)# i) God’s covenant with Isaac (Gen 26:3)\nii) God’s covenant with Jacob (Gen 28:13)\nf) God’s covenant with Moses for Israel (Ex 24:3-8)# g) God’s covenant with Aaron (Ex. 40:12-15, Num 25:12-13, Neh 13:29)# h) God’s covenant with David to his family (2 Sam 7:11-16, Psa 89:3, Jer 33:21, 2 Chr 13:5)# i) God’s new (renewed) covenant with Israel and Judah (Hos 2:18-23, Jer 31:31-34)# c. Types of Covenants# 1) Blood covenants# a) Blood covenants were made by two parties. Both cut up animals and walked between them saying “If I do not hold to the agreements of this covenant, you can do to me what we did to this animal.” - Jer 34:18-20.# b) Although we often see blood associated with covenants, we must not presume all covenants in the Bible are sealed in blood.# c) Hebrews 13:20 - The covenant(s) and the blood of Christ cannot be ignored# i) Noah sacrificed animals before God made the covenant (Gen 8:20)\n(a) God walked though a cut of blood to covenant with Abraham\nThe Mosaic covenant was in blood (Ex. 24:8, Heb 9:19-20)\n(b) New covenant was in blood (Matt 26:28, Mar 14:24, Luk 22:20, Heb 10:29, 12:24, 13:20)\n2) Bilateral or Conditional covenants# a) covenants are usually made between two parties. In a bilateral covenant, each party agrees to upholding a certain set of conditions.# 3) Unilateral or Unconditional covenants# a) A unilateral covenant is where one party guarantees carrying out both the responsibilities and results of the arrangement.# 4) Marriage covenant# a) Marriage (as instituted by God) is unique. Two unilateral parties (one man, one woman) enter a covenant before God in unconditional agreement with each other until death. The only possible conditions for the covenant to be dissolved is by adultery or abandonment (unbeliever).# 5) Covenant of Salt - “equivalent to an indissoluble covenant, or inviolable contract” - Keil \u0026amp; Delitzsch# 6) Definition of the word covenant# a) The Hebrew term BERIYTH for \u0026ldquo;covenant\u0026rdquo; is from a root with the sense of \u0026ldquo;cutting\u0026rdquo;, because pacts or covenants were made by passing between cut pieces of flesh of the victim of an animal sacrifice. - Wikipedia# b) The Greek word for covenant is DIATHEKE which means a disposition, arrangement, of any sort, which one wishes to be valid, the last disposition which one makes of his earthly possessions after his death, a testament or will.# d. Summarizing Types of Covenants as agreements# 1) International treaties (Joshua 9:6, 1 Kings 15:19)# 2) Clan alliances (Gen 14:13)# 3) Personal agreements (Gen 31:44)# 4) Legal contracts (Jer 34:8-10)# 5) Loyalty agreements (1 Sam 20:14-17)# 6) Marriage (Mal 2:14)# 7) Other terms used for Covenants# a) Covenant as promise - although God makes promises, covenants are usually more involved than a simple promise.# b) Covenant as grace or redemption - divine covenants are sometimes soteriological in nature but not every time and not by definition. While the most important thing is God’s plan of redemption (especially to me as an individual) it is not everything God is doing. He has many things happening at once.# c) Covenant as administration or relational - this is to see the covenants from a theological interpretive nature# d) Covenant as vassal treaty or land grant - the problem with this view is that God’s covenants are seen as being based on this understanding rather than the vassal treaty arrangement having an origin and beginning from God’s dealings with man. God certainly uses means to relate with man in terms he can understand but His relation is not on the basis of human understanding but rather on His the basis of His character.# e. Based on the Scriptural usage of the word in international treaties, clan alliances, personal agreements, legal contracts and loyalty agreements, the types of covenants, and the meaning of the original words, we define a biblical covenant as an agreement or binding alliance between two parties, establishing a relationship of trust. The nature of a covenant is explained within itself. Usually they are a solemn, unbreakable, never-ending bond.# D. Building an understanding from the Biblical usage of covenants# 1. Care must be taken to build a theological understanding from the teaching of Scripture, not the other way around. This is especially true in regards to the divine covenants.# a. God’s plan of the ages can be understood through covenants He has made with man# 1) The divine covenants do not go against any of God’s attributes# 2) The divine covenants reveal the purposes and relationship between God and man, particularly in regards to His chosen nation, Israel# 2. Different theological systems regarding covenants# a. 2 Covenants/ 3 Covenants - Covenant Theology# 1) Covenant of works vs covenant of grace + covenant of redemption# 2) Covenant of works is before the fall of man when God gives him duties to fulfill# 3) Understands biblical covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic etc. Etc. ) within covenant of grace# 4) Church starts at Adam -\u0026gt; Israel -\u0026gt; today# 5) The covenant theologian indirectly admits this theology is not taught in Scripture but is necessary to ‘understand’ Scripture\u0026hellip;# \u0026hellip;that only (historic) Reformed theology provides the system of doctrine necessary for an exposition of the divine covenants which is faithful to the teaching of Scripture. Karlberg, “Covenant Theology” p. 11.\nb. 5 Covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)# c. 7 Covenants (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Land, Mosaic, Davidic, New)# d. 8 Covenants (Adamic, Adamic (post fall) Noahic, Abrahamic, Land, Mosaic, Davidic, New)# II. God made covenants with man# A. A word concerning God’s covenant program# 1. Throughout history we notice how God initiates agreements with people to establish a relational dynamic. This is true before the fall, it is true after the fall when all is broken and eventually the relationship with man will be fully restored through Jesus Christ.# 2. God’s covenant program can be traced back to the Abrahamic covenant (Gen 12:1-3) and further clarification is given in Genesis 13:14-17 and Genesis 17:1-8. This covenant was codified in Genesis 15.# 3. A general order of practice can be seen the covenants God makes with man. First, God promises the covenant, then God ratifies the covenant and finally God fulfills the covenant.# Promised Inaugurated/Ratified Observance/Fulfillment Noahic Gen 6:18 Gen 9:9 Gen 9:11 Abrahamic Gen 12 Gen 15 Kingdom of God Mosaic Ex. 6:4 Ex. 24:8 Mat 5:17 New Covenant Jer 31 Luke 22:20 Jer 31:34 Kingdom of God # B. Adamic (Edenic) Covenant - Before the fall (Hosea 6:7, Gen 1:26-30, 2:15-25)# 1. God evidently made a covenant with Adam in the garden. Hosea 6:7# a. God made a conditional covenant with Adam (Gen 1:18, 2:16- 17)# 1) Adam was to care for the garden and the animals. (Gen 1:26, 28)# 2) Adam was to multiply and be fruitful. (Gen 1:28)# 3) Adam was not to take from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (Gen 2:17)# b. Some would say “Adam” in Hosea 6:7 refers to men in general?# 1) God did not make a covenant with men in general# 2) Probably not since the breaking of the covenant would have to refer to Adam not mankind for this verse to make sense. Israel would have to understand ‘the covenant’ that Adam would have broken. (Joel 31:33)# C. God’s Covenant to Noah (Gen 8:15-9:17)# 1. Genesis 6:18 - \u0026ldquo;But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife, and your sons\u0026rsquo; wives with you. This is the first use of the word covenant (BERITH) .# 2. Universal - To Noah, his descendants and all flesh (Gen 9:11)# 3. Sign of the covenant is the rainbow (Gen 9:12-17)# a. The idea of an outward sign in connection with a covenant is established# 4. Duration: Forever (Gen 9:16)# 5. Commands of the covenant# a. Be fruitful and multiply (Gen 9:1, 7)# b. No eating blood (Gen 9:3-4)# c. Men must govern - life is sacred, capital punishment (Gen 9:5-6)# 6. The promises contained in the covenant# a. God will never destroy every living thing (Gen 8:21-22)# b. The animal kingdom will fear man (Gen 9:2)# c. Man has right to eat meat (Gen 9:3)# d. There will never be a world-wide flood to destroy the earth (Gen 9:11, 15)# 7. Conditions of the covenant - unconditional# # D. God’s Covenant to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3, 13:14-18, 15:1-21, 17:1-27, 1 Chr 18:3, 2 Chr 9:25-26, Acts 3:12-26, Rom 4, Gal 3:1-18)# 1. As we study the covenants God makes with people, we see the covenants interconnected and God has a certain plan in mind. He chooses individuals for the purpose of furthering that program.# a. Noah lived 950 years. In Genesis 10-11 we’re told how man quickly became corrupted after the flood. Babel (in Shinar) is the narrative of how mankind as one nation and language became corrupted and idolatrous.# b. Not long before Noah dies, God calls Abram out of Ur (in the land of Shinar), out his culture, his people, his former heritage and pagan life to a place God had for him.# 1) The promise of a land was conditioned on Abram’s faith in God.# c. Understanding the connection between Noah and Abraham# 1) Soon after Noah and his family get off the ark, we see that evidently sin did not get destroyed in the flood. (Genesis 9:18-29). It it in this account that we also see how Shem is chosen in connection to God’s blessing and Canaan (Ham’s descendant) is cursed. Noah’s blessings and curses should probably be understood as prophetic.# a) Genesis 9:24 - When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. When Noah woke up from his drunken stupor he deals with his sons who got involved.# b) Genesis 9:25 - So he said, \u0026ldquo;Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers.\u0026rdquo; Noah curses Ham’s son (and the Canaanites) for his sinful response to Noah’s drunkenness.# c) Genesis 9:26 - He also said, \u0026ldquo;Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant. God receives blessing and glory for Shem’s actions. Canaan would be his servant.# d) Abraham is a descendant of Shem, the line of blessing (Gen 11:10-26)# (ii) Moses gives this account to Israel after they have left Egypt as background to God’s sovereign choice of Israel as His nation. Israel was to serve as a vessel for God to show his glory and light unto the nations. They needed to understand God had given them the land of Canaan and take it by faith because God had given it to them.\n2. The initial promise to Abram is found in Genesis 12:1-3# a. In a similar fashion as God did with Noah, God promises to establish a covenant with him in the future. Like Noah, Abraham would have to trust God and move forward knowing that following his move to a foreign land God would establish his covenant with him.# b. Genesis 12:1 - Now the LORD said to Abram, \u0026ldquo;Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father\u0026rsquo;s house, To the land which I will show you; Abram needed to leave his home and go to a land where God wanted for this promise to be enacted. This reminds us of Noah who had to build and ark and trust God through the flood before God made a covenant with him. Once the covenant was made it was not conditioned in any way on Abraham’s part.# c. Genesis 12:2 - And I will make you a great nation. Abraham would be made by God into a great nation.# d. Genesis 12:2b - And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing. He would be blessed by God and become a blessing to others. God’s blessings are so we can bless others.# e. Genesis 12:3a - And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. Blessings and curses would come to nations that either blessed or cursed Israel.# f. Genesis 12:3b And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed. All the families or ethnic peoples of the earth would be blessed in him.# 3. The covenant contains 9 promises and can be summed up into 3.# a. The land (Gen 15:18-21)# b. The seed (Gen 22:17)# c. The blessing (Gen 22:17-18)# 4. General features of the Abrahamic covenant# a. Eternal (Gen 13:15, 17:7-8, 13, 19)# b. Unconditional (Gen 15:9-12, 17-18) God swore by himself (Heb 6:13)# c. Future fulfillment# 5. Literal historical fulfillment# 1) Abraham was blessed# a) Land (Gen 13:8, 14:22-23)# b) Servants (Gen 15:7)# c) Cattle (Gen 13:2, 24:34-35)# 2) Abraham had many offspring (Josh 24:3)# 3) Abraham became a great name (2Chr 20:7, Luk 1:73, Luk 13:28, Rom 4:3)# 4) Abraham has become a channel of blessing to all people groups (Gal 3:7-9)# 5) Historically nations have been blessed or cursed in direct relation to Israel# a) Edomites cursed for cursing Israel (Oba 1:2, 10, 12)# (iii) Future destruction promised (Obadiah 1:15)\nb) Abimelech blessed for blessing Israel (Gen 20:2-18)# c) Others (Deut 30:7, Isa 14:1-2, Joe 3:1-8, Matt 25:40-45)# 6) Abraham had an heir by Sarah (Gen 21:2)# 6. Literal Future Fulfillment# a. Israel’s sin and lack of keeping the Mosaic covenant did not annul the unconditional promises God made to Abraham’s descendants. (Gal 3:17)# b. Though many initial things were seen, the covenant was not fulfilled during Abraham’s life. He was looking ahead for its fulfillment (Heb 11:8-12, Jn 8:56).# c. It was not fulfilled before Jesus’ death (Matt 26:29, Luk 22:16, 18, 29-30)# d. Seed aspect: David’s throne (over Israel from Jerusalem) is currently exercising authority. Jesus Christ will be seated on the throne of David as king over Israel and the nations.# 1) Luke 22:69 \u0026ldquo;But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD.\u0026rdquo; Jesus is currently seated at the right hand of the Father’s throne.# a) The LORD says to my Lord: \u0026ldquo;Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.\u0026rdquo; Jesus was not seated at God’s right hand until after his ascension. (Heb 10:12) He will be seated there for a temporary period of time not eternally as was promised to David. (2 Sam 7:14, Heb 1:8)# 2) Revelation 3:21 - \u0026lsquo;He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. Jesus is currently seated at his Father’s throne. One day he will be seated on his throne.# 3) Isaiah 9:6 - For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. This is a reference of Jesus. A child is born is regarding his humanity. A son will be given has to do with his divinity. The government (rule of heaven and earth) will be upon his shoulders.# 4) Isaiah 9:7a - *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom\u0026hellip;*Jesus will reign on David’s throne (as descendent of David) and the duration of it will be forever.# e. The fullness of the gentiles has obviously not come in today. Gentiles are still getting saved. Therefore, God’s program will shift to work with Israel once again in the future (Rom 11:25).# f. The land boundary markers have not been fulfilled (Gen 15:18-21). The land was not given to Abraham but rather to his descendants.# 7. The Abrahamic covenant is further developed throughout the Old Testament# a. To Isaac (Gen 17:19, Gen 26:2-4)# b. To Jacob (Gen 28:13-15)# c. Land covenant (Deut. 30:1-10)# d. Davidic covenant (Seed) (2 Sam. 7:14-16)# e. New covenant (Blessing) (Jer. 31:31-34)# 8. Outward sign of the covenant (Gen 17:9-14)# a. Many covenants had an outward, earthly sign. The sign of the Abrahamic covenant was circumcision# E. Mosaic Covenant - God’s bilateral agreement with Israel (Ex 19-24, Deut 28:1-16, )# 1. God promises Moses to rescue Israel from oppression and give them a land flowing with milk and honey (the land of the Canaanites) at the burning bush incident (Ex 3:17)# 2. This covenant is between God and Israel, established at Mount Sinai (Ex 19:3-8)# a. Exodus 19:3a - Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, God’s instruction to Moses was to bring Israel to this point and get further instructions. (Ex 3:12)# b. Exodus 19:3b - saying, \u0026ldquo;Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel: This covenant is a bilateral agreement between Israel and God mediated through Moses.# c. Exodus 19:4 - \u0026lsquo;You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles\u0026rsquo; wings, and brought you to Myself. By grace Israel had been brought out. God demonstrated his promise to Israel by rescuing her from Egypt. (Rom 9:15-17)# d. Exodus 19:5a - \u0026lsquo;Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant...the conditional aspect of this covenant is set forth from the beginning. The condition was if Israel fully obeyed God’s voice and kept his covenant.# e. Exodus 19:5b - then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; As Israel kept this covenant it would become evident among all the peoples that they were in fact his possession. God had already said they were brought out to himself. They were already chosen. This was an unconditional promise made to Abraham centuries before. Therefore, we conclude this was not about becoming God’s possession but rather walking before men reflecting who they already were.# f. Exodus 19:6a - and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Becoming a kingdom of priests and a holy nation was conditional upon keeping the Law. Under this theocratic kingdom, Israel would be a holy nation with priests. This refers to a literal, earthly fulfillment as stated by Moses in his last words in Deuteronomy 33:29 , “Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you, And you will tread upon their high places.” (Num 24:8, 17, Dan 7:27)# g. Exodus 19:6b-7 - These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel. So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him. Moses was the mediator between God and the people. And Moses brought back the words of the people to the LORD. (Ex 19:8b)# h. Exodus 19:8 - All the people answered together and said, \u0026ldquo;All that the LORD has spoken we will do!\u0026rdquo;. Israel was just miraculously delivered from slavery under the most powerful ruler on earth. They are excited to be free and will accept to do anything God asks. Little do they know, the Law is much too demanding and high a standard to be kept all of the time.# i. Exodus 20 - The Ten Commandments - the basic terms of the Mosaic Covenant# 1) The four first commands had to do with God their sovereign# a) To honor the one true God# b) Jesus sums these commands as \u0026lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.’ Matthew 22:37# 2) Six commands had to do with man# a) Respecting fellow man# b) Jesus sums up these commands as, \u0026lsquo;YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.\u0026rsquo; Matthew 22:39# 3) It established a nation with its own constitution# a) Established national independence# b) Established moral code# c) Established relationships between Israel and God as sovereign and man as equal-rights bearers.# (i) Written with finger of God (Deut 4:13, Ex 31:18, 32:16)\n(ii) All 12 tribes of Israel accepted the terms\n4) Given to establish Israel’s national identity# 5) Given to keep in custody until Christ came (Gal 3:19, 23)# 6) Established God’s righteous standard to make known to humankind# 7) It was given for convicting of knowledge of sin (Rom 3:19, 5:20, Rom 7:7)# a) To lead to Christ# 3. The Mosaic Covenant was ratified in blood (Ex 24:1-8)# 4. Was given on a temporary basis (‘forever’ with conditions) (Deut 12:28)# a. God knew they would not keep it (Eze 20:25, Rom 7:10)# b. Though they promised they would to everything God said, they failed miserably (Deut 5:27-28, Jer 11:10). They were bound to fail since it was conditioned on man’s faithfulness and not God’s.# 5. This covenant was a bilateral agreement (Deut 5:28-29)# a. Conditioned upon Israel’s obedience# 1) Rewarded for keeping it - (Deut 11:26-28)# 2) Punished for disobeying - (Deut 11:26-28)# 6. Sign of the covenant is the Sabbath day (Ex. 31:12-18)# a. A national day of rest reflected God as their creator# b. Each individual person was to set aside the 7th day and remember God# 7. The Mosaic covenant was never given to justify anyone (Gal 3:11)# 8. Given 430 years after the Abrahamic Covenant (Gal 3:16-18)# a. Did not annul or add conditions to the Abraham covenant# F. ‘Land’ Covenant - (Deuteronomy 29-30, Ezekiel 16, 47:1-48:35)# 1. Sometimes this covenant is incorrectly referred to as the Palestinian covenant. Not only is this term not used in the Bible, this term was coined by a Roman emperor named Hadrian who prohibited Jews from entering Israel again and tried to wipe out the memory of Israel by calling the land after their enemies, the Philistines.# a. The Lord called it the land of Israel. (Matt 2:20, Gen 9:25-27)# b. Old Testament calls it the promised land (Gen 28:15, 50:24, Ex 12:25, Num 14:16, Deut 6:3, 9:28, 19:8, 27:3, Josh 23:5)# 1) Land flowing with milk and honey (Deut 6:3)# 2. Genesis 15:18-21 - On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, \u0026ldquo;To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates: the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.\u0026rdquo; The size of this land given to Abram is clearly stated. (Eze 47:15-20)# 3. Deuteronomy 29:1 - These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb...though Moses is involved in the making of this covenant, and it is also between God and Israel, clearly this covenant is not connected to the Mosaic Covenant (Deut 29:13).# 4. Deuteronomy 30:20 - \u0026hellip;for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them. This covenant is an expansion of the Abrahamic.# 5. There are 8 promises in this covenant. The land will eventually be given to Israel, yet the timing of fulfillment based on Israel’s spiritual return to the Lord (Deut 30:1-8)# a. Deuteronomy 30:1 - \u0026ldquo;So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you, First: Israel will disobey the Mosaic Covenant and be spread out around the world (Deut 29:2-30:1, Eze 16:35-52).# b. Deuteronomy 30:2 - and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons, Second: Israel will repent.# c. Deuteronomy 30:3 - then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you, Third: The Messiah will come.# d. Deuteronomy 30:3b-4 - and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you.\u0026ldquo;If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back. Fourth: Israel will be regathered.# 1) Since the scattering is literal (70AD), we must understand the regathering to also be literal.# e. Deuteronomy 30:5 - The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers. Fifth: Israel will possess the Promised Land (Eze 47:22).# f. Deuteronomy 30:6 - Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live. Sixth: Israel will be regenerated.# g. Deuteronomy 30:7 - The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you. Seventh: the enemies of Israel will be judged.# h. Deuteronomy 30:8 - And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today. Eighth: Israel will receive full blessing; specifically, the blessings of the Messianic Age. (Deut 30:8-20)# 6. The importance of this covenant is that it affirms Israel’s title deed to the land# a. There are no ‘ifs’. It is unconditional based on the covenant made to Abraham.# 1) Since it is unconditional it is still in effect today# # G. God’s covenant to David and his House (2 Chr 7:18, 13:5, 21:7, 2 Sam 7:14, Jer 33:14-26, Psa 89:28-29, 33-34, 110:1, 132:11-18)# 1. The Davidic Covenant is an expansion to the seed (a great nation) aspect of the Abrahamic covenant.# 2. 2 Samuel 7:12-16 - About four hundred years after the covenant is given, David wanted to build God a house. In return however, God says he will allow David’s son to build him a temple and make David’s house and his throne last forever. (1 Chr 38:3, 5)# a. 2 Samuel 7:12 - \u0026ldquo;When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom. God promises to raise up a descendant (singular) from David’s blood line and establish his kingdom. (Psa 132:11)# 1) Usually Bible prophecy contains a near and a far fulfillment# a) 1 Kings 1 narrates God working behind the scenes to secure the throne for Solomon, David’s son.# (i) The fulfillment of this near prophecy means God will fulfill the far prophecy.# (ii) Since Solomon literally sat on the literal throne of his father David, then it stands to reason the far prophecy must be literally fulfilled as well. Jesus Christ will sit on a literal, earthly throne from the city of Jerusalem. (Dan 7:13-14)# (iii) Some interpret David’s throne to be spiritual. However many verses refute this idea. The arguments given against the literal fulfillment are very often very simplistic and don’t cover the vast amount of passages covering the literal fulfillment of David’s throne. Here are some reasons why we cannot spiritualize this kingdom.# (a) Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream disagrees with a spiritual fulfillment. (Dan 2:2:44-45)\n(i) This 5th kingdom destroys the first 4 earthly kingdoms. Those who say Jesus is reigning on David’s throne right now, must also accept that the kingdoms of man were destroyed, yet clearly that is not the case. (Isa 9:7)\n(b) The throne mentioned in heaven is God’s, not David’s (Heb. 1:13; 8:1; 12:2; 1 Pet. 3:22, Dan 7:9,13, Mat 5:34, Mat 23:32, Rev 3:21, 5:7, 7:15, 12:5).\n(i) Psalm 132:13-17 For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation\u0026hellip;There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.\n(ii) At present, Jesus as high priest is interceding between the church and the throne of God and not fulfilling the Davidic covenant. (Rom 8:34; 1 Tim 2:5, Heb 4:16)\n(iii) God’s throne was set up in eternity past. David’s was not. (Psa 93:2)\n(c) David’s throne is directly connected with the nation of Israel (Jer 33:17, 21, Mat 19:28, Isa 2:1-4, Isa 24:23, Jer 23:5-6, Mic 4:1-5)\n(i) It would give them rest from their enemies (2 Sam 7:10-11)\n(ii) They would be regenerated (Jer 31:33)\n(iii) Jerusalem will be the center of the world (Zech 8:3)\n(d) Factors indicating the distinction between God’s throne and David’s throne:\n(i) Several descendants of David have sat on his throne, but only one descendant ever sits at the right hand of God’s throne in Heaven. (Psa 110:1; Heb 8:1; 12:2)\n(ii) David’s throne was not established before his lifetime but God’s throne exists eternally. (2 Sam 7:16-17, Psa 93:1-2)\nb. 2 Samuel 7:13 - \u0026ldquo;He shall build a house for My name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever\u0026hellip; This is in regarding Solomon building a house for God. (1 Chr 17:11-12) The throne aspect is what is forever, not Solomon. Solomon will actually be cut off from the Messianic line (Jer 22:30; 36:30).# c. 2 Samuel 7:14 - \u0026ldquo;I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men, this is in reference to the long term aspect of the prophecy.# 1) Near fulfillment: Solomon committed iniquity (similar to Saul) yet God did not withdraw his promise made to David.# 2) Far fulfillment: Jesus did not commit iniquity, however he did identify and take on the sins of mankind, therefore God punished him using the rod and strokes of men. Christ did this in order to make the necessary payment for our sins. (Isa 53:6-10)# d. 2 Samuel 7:15 - but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you. Though Solomon failed similarly to Saul, Christ would not have God’s lovingkindness removed from him. (Isa 53:11-12, 2 Tim 2:8, Rev 5:5)# e. 2 Samuel 7:16 - \u0026ldquo;Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.\u0026rdquo; The term “house” refers to a dynasty – a family line of kings. God’s promise to David and his descendants is that his kingdom and royal family would always be on the throne. Just as David’s throne is literal, David’s houses’ throne will also be literal with the literal people of David, the Jews. (Psa 132:13-14, 2 Sam 22:51)# f. Genesis 3:15 - And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel.\u0026rdquo; This was the original mention of the promised seed.# 3. The fulfillment of the Davidic throne in the greater son of David – the Lord Jesus Christ# a. Matthew and Luke establish the genealogy of Jesus. They identify Jesus as the son of David. (Mat 1:1-17, Luk 3:23-31)# ​ i. Both legally and biologically, Jesus is related to David.\nb. The virgin Mary was told of her son who would be heir to the throne of David. (Luk 1:31-33)# 1) Luke 1:31 \u0026ldquo;And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus. She would bear a son and she would call him Jesus. (Gen 3:15)# c. Blind men knew Jesus was the Son of David. (Mat 9:27)# d. Luke 1:32 \u0026ldquo;He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David; Gabriel’s announcement verifies Mary’s Son will be the fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant. Jesus, son of the most high, was also a descendant of David. God would give him David’s throne. God has not given him this throne yet. David’s Son must return to earth to rule on David’s throne. (Psa 110:1, Rev 3:21, Isa 9:6-7, Zech 14:9, Matt 22:42-44, Mat 25:31)# 1) David’s throne was earthly, political, and limited to Israel and not spiritual# e. Luke 1:33 and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.\u0026rdquo; Mary’s son would reign over Israel (the house of Jacob) his term as king would never end, his kingdom would be eternal.# 1) Christ has the key of David (Rev 3:7)# f. Revelation 22:3 - There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him; The new heavens and new earth once God has restored all things has Christ reigning forever and ever (Rev 22:5)# g. Revelation 22:16 - \u0026ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.\u0026rdquo; The root – He existed before David, speaks to the eternality of Christ.# 1) The offspring – He was born a descendant of David fulfilling the promise of an eternal king in the line of David.# h. Since the Davidic covenant is an expansion to the seed aspect of the Abrahamic covenant, it is unconditional in its fulfillment and will be in the millennial reign. (Rev 20:4, 22:16)# i. Understanding the Davidic Covenant means we know world peace will not come through social and political activity of the church.# 1) As long as Israel remains in disobedience, Jesus Christ will not return to rule on the Davidic throne.# 2) Presently, Jesus is seated at the right of the Father’s throne, not on David’s throne.# 4. We live in anticipation of a future literal reign of Jesus Christ on the earth.# a. Christ’s return to establish His reign will usher in the Millennial Kingdom (Rev 19-20).# b. Christ’s rule will be from Jerusalem. (Jer 3:17; Zec 14:16)# c. Christ’s rule will extend over Israel. (Eze 37:21-28)# d. Christ’s rule will extend beyond Israel to all the nations of the earth. (Psa 2:8; 72:8; Isa 49:6; Zec 9:10)# 5. World peace will not come through the social and political activity of secular humanism.# a. Isaiah 2:4 – And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war. The audacity of the UN to put the quote on their building indicates their contempt for the Davidic Covenant and God’s plan.# b. They have removed the Prince of Peace from the formula by placing themselves in His position.# 1) Permanent peace through humanism is impossible as it is set against the Creator – it is the thought system of the god of the world and not the God of creation.# 2) The world will preach “peace at any cost” but they are lying – the cost is humility to submit before the Creator and they will not do it. (1 Thes 5:3)# 3) Isaiah 9:6-7 – For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. Lasting peace will only come when the Prince of Peace personally rules the earth on the throne of David.# 4) Until then, do not be found supporting the enemy’s fabricated plan of false peace.# H. God’s New Covenant (Jer 31:31-34, Eze 36:22-38, 37:25-28, Heb 7, 8:6-13, 12, 13)# 1. Contrary to popular belief, the Old Covenant is not the Old Testament and the New Testament is not the New Covenant. In fact, the New Covenant is first introduced, promised and explained in the Old Testament.# 2. The New Covenant is an amplification to the blessing aspect of the Abrahamic covenant. Gen 12:1-3# a. Ezekiel 37:25 \u0026ldquo;They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons\u0026rsquo; sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever. This verse ties the Abrahamic covenant, the land (Jacob my servant) and a kingdom (David my servant) and people forever (their sons and their sons’ sons forever).# b. Ezekiel 37:26 \u0026ldquo;I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever. Here a future covenant is announced. The nature of this covenant of peace is unconditional (Ezekiel 36:21-23).# c. Ezekiel 37:27 \u0026ldquo;My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. God’s dwelling place refers to Israel walking with God. Here it is announced they will reflect God’s character to the nations.# d. Ezekiel 37:28 \u0026ldquo;And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.\u0026rdquo; This is an everlasting covenant (Isa 55:3, Isa 61:8-9, Jer 32:40, 50:5) and will serve for all to know that the Lord is the one who sanctifies Israel.# e. Ezekiel 16:59 For thus says the Lord GOD, \u0026ldquo;I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant. The only covenant Israel could have broken was the Mosaic covenant. Blessing under this covenant was conditioned upon their obedience.# f. Ezekiel 16:60 \u0026ldquo;Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. The covenant made in the days of her youth is in reference to the childhood of Israel, specifically going back to the Abrahamic covenant.# 3. Jeremiah 31:31-34 tells of the New Covenant that God would establish with Israel.# 1) Jeremiah 31:31 \u0026ldquo;Behold, days are coming,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. This is the first time a new covenant is mentioned in the Bible. The time of establishment of the covenant is not stated but who it will be with is clear that it is to Israel and to the house of Judah. Ratification of it would be future (compare Gen 6:18 with Gen 9:9). This will be a covenant with Israel and with the house of Judah.# 2) Jeremiah 31:32 not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD. This covenant will be different in nature to the Mosaic covenant which was made between God and Israel in the land of Egypt.# a) Mosaic Covenant - the implication is that if the old covenant was made to Israel, then the new covenant is in contrast to the Mosaic covenant. (Heb 8:13)# 3) Jeremiah 31:33 \u0026ldquo;But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. This refers to the spiritual renewal Israel will undergo when they change their minds and believe in Jesus as Messiah. God’s law internalized. Jer 32:40# 4) Jeremiah 31:34 \u0026ldquo;They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, \u0026lsquo;Know the LORD,\u0026rsquo; for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,\u0026rdquo; declares the LORD, \u0026ldquo;for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.\u0026rdquo; Israel was always having to teach because they often forgot and were cursed as a result. A day will come when this will no longer be needed in Israel, all will know the Lord. Joel 2:28-32# a) The restored people is literal# (i) Will live on the hills of Samaria (Jer 31:5-6)# (ii) Israel and Judah will dwell together (Jer 31:24)# b. Ezekiel 36 also mentions some of the provisions of the New Covenant# 1) Physical return (Eze 36:22, 24, 28)# 2) Spiritual return (Eze 36:25-26)# 3) Cleansing of sin (Eze 36:25, 29, 33)# 4) Indwelling of the Spirit (Eze 36:27)# 5) Fertility in the land (Eze 36:29-30, 24-25)# 6) National repentance (Eze 36:31-32)# 7) Physical fertility (Eze 36:37-38)# 8) Sole devotion to God (Eze 36:33, Eze 34:25, 37:26)# 9) Perpetual, national existence (v. 35-37, Isa 24:5, 61:8-9, Jer 23:40, 50:5, Eze 16:60, 27:26)# 10) Jerusalem is permanently rebuilt (v. 38-40)# c. Timing of the New Covenant# 1) These provisions have never been fulfilled in Israel’s past and certainly not today, their fulfillment awaits a future kingdom age.# 2) When it would be ratified is mentioned (making or cutting a covenant) but timing is ambiguous from the Old Testament (Isa 55:3, 61:8, Jer 31:31, 32:40, Eze 34:25, 37:26)# 3) Fulfillment of the New Covenant will be In that day (Isa 42:6, 49:8, 59:21, Hos 2:18-20)# I. The New Covenant in relation to the Church# 1. It is possible that you may disagree with our conclusions regarding this next section of the study. We would ask you however to prayerfully consider it as a good Berean and see if it agrees or not with the Scriptures. Acts 17:11# 2. The Covenants (including the new covenant) were given to Israel (Rom 9:4) so in order to have a better grasp, we must define who true Israel is. Heb 8:10# a. Many Bible teachers today would have us believe that all of the promises in the bible are for every believer. This is a mistaken conclusion and sadly lacking of truth. While God never changes, while his character is always intact and his promises are trustworthy, his interaction with man as it pertains to his administration has undergone change and we can also see in unfulfilled prophecy that changes are yet to come.# b. Romans 9:6 And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. As Paul concludes his letter to the Galatians, he speaks of them (Gentile believers) and upon the Israel of God (Jewish believers). Rom 11:1-2, Rom 11:25-26# 1) To be a true Israelite one must not only be ethnically Jewish but also a believer. Jesus was saying Nathanael was a believing Jew in John 1:47 when he first spoke to him, “…Lo, truly an Israelite*, in whom guile is not.*\u0026rdquo; YLT# c. Romans 11:26-27 and so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written, \u0026ldquo;THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB. THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS.\u0026rdquo; Removal of sins has only ever been possible through faith in Christ not by being born an Israelite. To be a true Israelite, one must be born a Jew and also believe.# 1) All Israel can in no way be seen as being saved today. The covenant God has with them however says all of Israel will be saved.# 3. Though the parties of the New Covenant are Israel and God, the church has been spiritually incorporated to take part of this blessing. How?# a. First, let’s take a look at what this does not mean# 1) The church did not replace God’s program with Israel# a) Israel is geo-political, national and ethnic in nature, the church is not.# b) True Israel is not the church but rather believing Israel# 2) The New covenant is not being fulfilled today# 3) The church involvement is not discussed in the Old Testament# 4) The church is not under a covenant# b. God had said to Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed through him. Gentiles have become blessed through their inclusion by faith in Jesus Christ.# 4. Jesus Christ is the reason why the church partakes of the New Covenant blessings# a. He is the mediator of the New Covenant. Heb 8:6# b. Hebrews 10:9 then He said, \u0026ldquo;BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL.\u0026rdquo; He takes away the first in order to establish the second.# 1) Taking away the “first” means to take away ritual sacrifices of the Mosaic covenant. Jesus Christ fulfilled this conditional covenant given to Israel. Mat 5:17# 2) Establishing the ”second” means to replace ritual sacrifices with the righteous life of Jesus who was crucified in man’s place as a true substitute sacrifice for sin (1 John 2:1-2).# c. Hebrews 10:10 By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. We here refers to the church. Heb 10:15# d. Hebrews 10:11 Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins; Under the Mosaic covenant, the priestly duty was never finished. It was merely a demonstration of what was needed to make purification for sins.# e. Hebrews 10:12 *but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD…*Christ however, by becoming a substitutionary sacrifice, offering himself on our behalf, was sufficient for all time and is now seated.# f. Hebrews 10:13 waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET. Sitting on His throne, Jesus is now waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for His feet when the New Covenant Kingdom of God comes to the earth.# 1) While Jesus is making intercession for the saints, He is also waiting for God the Father to subjugate all His enemies.# 2) The enemies of Christ will be subdued at the Second Advent when Jesus comes back to save His people Israel from its Gentile enemies and set up the promised Messianic Kingdom prophesied throughout the Old Testament (Psalm 110:1-7; 2:1-12; Jeremiah 30:1-11; 31:1-6, 27-40; Zechariah 12:10; 14:2-5; Revelation 19:11-20:6; Hebrews 1:14; 2:5-8; 4:9; 12:22-29; 1 Corinthians 15:20-28).# 3) While Jesus waits for the fulfillment of Israel’s prophetic covenants, the special dispensation of the church age has been revealed in the meantime through the New Testament mystery truths to confer salvation and great heavenly blessings upon Christians so they might be a witness to the enemies of Christ (Ephesians 2:14-3:11; Colossians 1:25-29; 2 Corinthians 5:14-21).# 4) While Jesus waits to take control of His enemies, today is a day of grace for both believers and unbelievers to take advantage of (Hebrews 3:7-15; 10:25; 2 Corinthians 6:1-2; Romans 2:4; 11:22).# g. Hebrews 10:14 For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified. Jesus has perfected forever those who are being sanctified (being saved), i.e., the saints, through His one-time sacrificial offering on the cross (Hebrews 10:10, 12; 7:25-28).# 1) The complete and efficacious onceness of the sacrificial offering of Jesus Christ, in contrast to Old Testament offerings, is strongly emphasized even further (Romans 6:10; 1 Peter 3:18).# a) The cross is, therefore, not only necessary, but also sufficient for salvation as nothing else be dare added (John 19:30; Colossians 2:8-15).# b) Did Jesus Christ do enough on the cross to save you from you sins? Hebrews 10:14 resoundingly says affirmative (John 6:35-40, 48-58)!# h. Hebrews 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying, now, through the Holy Spirit, the church is also made partakers of the new covenant blessings.# i. Hebrews 10:16 \u0026ldquo;THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,\u0026rdquo; He then says…them. This goes back to Israel and to the original promise made in Jeremiah 31:31-34.# j. Hebrews 10:17 \u0026ldquo;AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE.\u0026rdquo; Because of the new covenant, Israel’s sins will be forgiven.# k. Hebrews 10:18 Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin. The blood of the New Covenant is for the forgiveness of sins. Forgiveness of sins was a promise made to Israel in connection to the new covenant (Jer 31:34, Matt 26:17-35, Lev 17:11).# 1) Now, because Christ’s blood ratified the covenant and because his blood was also shed for sin of the whole world, the church (Jews and Gentiles) have become partakers of the blessings without annulling or affecting in any way the inauguration and fulfillment of the new covenant to Israel as a nation.# l. Christ’s blood is the means by which the New Covenant is ratified. Jesus instituted the Lord’s supper for the church which commemorates this covenant. Each time the church celebrates the Lord’s table, it commemorates the New covenant ‘cutting ceremony’ in the shedding of Christ’s blood. (Heb 9:26) The new covenant is completely by God’s grace, totally undeserved by Israel.# 1) Christ’s blood ratified the New Covenant just like blood ratified the Mosaic (Ex 24:8, Luk 22:20)# a) Previous covenants were announced then ratified# (i) Noahic (Gen 6:18 - Gen 9:9)# (ii) Abrahamic (Gen 12:1-3 - Gen 15)# (iii) Mosaic (Exo 3:8 – Exo 24:8)# (iv) New Covenant (Jer 31:31 – the cross)# 2) 1 Corinthians 11:25 - In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, \u0026ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\u0026rdquo; Paul teaches the Corinthian church of the significance of the cup in the breaking of bread. The cup was a symbol of the blood Christ shed to ratify the new covenant.# 5. The church is the body and possession of Jesus Christ, therefore it has become partaker of the New Covenant blessings through the promised Holy Spirit.# 1) Mention is made that blessing would flow to the Gentiles upon ratification (Isa 55:5, Eze 36:36, 37:28)# 2) The church was a mystery in the Old Testament era (Eph 3:1-13), therefore we should not be surprised that the church is not mentioned in connection with the new covenant. The Old Testament simply contained no information regarding the church of Jesus Christ.# 3) What are some of the blessings the church partakes of the new covenant?# a) The church has been made servants of the new covenant. 2 Cor 3:6 says, “who also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.”# (i) Christ became a servant to confirm to Israel the promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, specifically the new covenant. Rom 15:8-13\nb) The forgiveness of sins# c) The Holy Spirit# (i) He sanctifies us,# (ii) He instructs us,# (iii) He empowers us for service,# (iv) He seals us until the day of redemption# Israel Church Similarities God Yahweh Kingdom Coming Kingdom Redemption Redemption (individual) Mission (light to nations) Differences Began Abraham Isaac Jacob Day of Pentecost Group Ethnic Non-ethnic Entity National International (spiritual organism) Priesthood inside nation Everyone is a priest Jesus as King Jesus as head/leader 6. The new covenant has not been inaugurated yet since it’s fulfillment is set for the coming kingdom, yet the church is already partaking to a certain degree of some of its spiritual blessings. God has already equipped the church with the Holy Spirit and is preparing the church as future servants of the new covenant to serve in the age to come when she will reign and rule with Christ when all of the new covenant blessings are fulfilled in the Messianic Kingdom.# # ** **\n# J. Conclusion# # K. Adamic “Covenant II” - after the fall God’s curse and promise to Adam (Gen 3:14-24)# 1. If this is a covenant it is by implication and in connection to the first.# a. Best understood as a new administration because sin entered into the world.# 2. Adam’s sin causes God to change the relationship with man and creation (Gen 3:17)# a. The land and soil is cursed, it will require toil for the land to produce.# b. Driven out of the garden to protect the way of tree of life lest man take of the fruit and live separated from God forever. (Gen 3:22)# 3. Relationships are now uneven, even hurtful (Gen 3:16)# a. Her desire is for husband but he will rule over her# b. Childbearing will now have multiplied pain# 4. Ground is cursed (Gen 3:17)# a. Food is from farming the soil not God’s garden# 5. God’s Promise (Gen 3:15)# a. Deliverer will come# b. Satan will be crushed# 6. Knowledge apart from God (Gen 3:22)# a. Confusion (what is reality? What is truth?)# b.

      "content":"Daniel# Chapter 6 ends the historical section Darius had no alternative but to enforce the law he\u0026rsquo;d been tricked to make. This was the law of the Medes and the Persians. No one could revoke this law. Yet, they will learn, there is one who is sovereign over men who is above any Medo-Persian law. Daniel 6:18 Darius\u0026rsquo;s Sleepless night# Daniel 6:18# Dan 6:18 Then the king went off to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.\nDarius\u0026rsquo; soul is troubled\nsleepless night\nwe’re led to feel sorry for the king.\nwrong side\nno rest\nsoul is under turmoil for doing wrong\nnobles sealed the stone. perhaps the kings seal was more for daniels protection from the nobles. And the noble\u0026rsquo;s seal is to make sure the king would not break Daniel out?\nDaniel could have thrown himself to the mercy of the nobles. he could have begged for mercy from the king. Daniel knew the law. Daniel was subject to its vain way just like Darius the king.\nDarius is a slave to his own system.\nlogically corrupted morally weak ethically wrong ironically, it\u0026rsquo;s legally right. Sometimes the law is just plain wrong, yet God is not delivering Daniel from the lions den. He delivers him from the Lions in the den. God has granted to governments to hold this authority, that is why it\u0026rsquo;s so important what they do with God\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty. When they don\u0026rsquo;t recognize that God granted them that position and the very existence of government, everything colapses very quickly. Daniel 6:19-23 Daniel\u0026rsquo;s Deliverance from the Lions# Daniel 6:19# Dan 6:19 Then the king arose at dawn, at the break of day, and went in haste to the lions\u0026rsquo; den.\nDid his grief overcome his fear of the nobles? Probably because the conditions of the law were met. Daniel had paid the demands of the law.\nDaniel 6:20# Dan 6:20 When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, \u0026ldquo;Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you constantly serve, been able to deliver you from the lions?\u0026rdquo;\nnote: \u0026lsquo;servant of the living God\u0026rsquo;, he is first and foremost a servant of God not servant of the medes and persians. This speaks that a servant of the living God can be an excelent benefit to those he is around as he reflects the God he serves. \u0026lsquo;constantly serve\u0026rsquo; - recognized as a servant of Jehovah. Daniel was known by Darius to constantly serve his God. Daniel was supernaturally delivered from the lions, not the den. Darius delivered Daniel from the den. Daniel 6:21# Dan 6:21 Then Daniel spoke to the king, \u0026ldquo;O king, live forever!\nPerhaps Daniel is surprised the king actually came? He expresses happiness to hear the king\u0026rsquo;s voice.\nDaniel is a cheerful fellow. He\u0026rsquo;s not complaining, he\u0026rsquo;s quick with a salutation to the king.\nDaniel 6:22# Dan 6:22 \u0026ldquo;My God sent His angel and shut the lions\u0026rsquo; mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.\u0026rdquo;\nDaniel recognizes his God (my God) as his ultimate deliverer and provider and recognizes the king’s authority. His innocence is unquestionably demonstrated by his deliverance. God defends Daniel Daniel 6:23# Dan 6:23 Then the king was very pleased and gave orders for Daniel to be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.\nMiraculous without a doubt. No harm had come to Daniel.\nWhen did Daniel trust his God? In the den of lions? I\u0026rsquo;m sure he did, but the trusting referred to in context is from before when he continued as usual praying three times a day. v. 10, 13, 16\nA word about faith - faith is not about the quantity or quality, it\u0026rsquo;s about the object in whom it\u0026rsquo;s placed. Paul expresses that\u0026hellip;\n2Ti 1:12 For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.\nPaul had believed, Paul was convinced, and had entrusted himself. But Paul\u0026rsquo;s faith weak or strong, was in God. That is the key! Daniel said, My God. Abraham\u0026rsquo;s faith was in God who He knew was able to perform that which he had said.\nEspecially encouraging to the Jews in the Second Temple period. They could identify with Daniel’s plight; their faith could be strengthened by God’s miraculous intervention. This would encourage them to put their faith in God.\nDaniel’s kind of faith should encourage us today as we face the pressures of living faithfully to God in these trying times of the Gentiles. We can trust God.\nfancy palace cave with lions entertainment - none can soothe his mind supernatural miracle - Daniel entertained watching an angel shut the lions mouths. Front seat to the Best circus act ever. Darius fasted lions fasted Dairus\u0026rsquo; soul in greatest physical comfort but troubled. soul among lions but at rest. No physical comfort but peace of God. Peter slept in prison victim of doing wrong. Spends night in guilt victim for doing right. 1 Pet 2:20 \u0026ldquo;But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.\u0026rdquo; reader ends up feeling sorry for this poor king suspense. reader is not even told until afterwards to encourage the king as it were. Daniel 6:24 The Conspirator\u0026rsquo;s Doom# Daniel 6:24# Dan 6:24 The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they cast them, their children and their wives into the lions\u0026rsquo; den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\nHe was not spared on account of the lions’ lack of hunger; he was spared because of God’s intervention.\ncultural to send all close relatives to same demise so there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be danger of revenge. Daniel 6:25-28 Darius\u0026rsquo; Decree# Daniel 6:25# Dan 6:25 Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations and men of every language who were living in all the land: \u0026ldquo;May your peace abound!\nDaniel 6:26# Dan 6:26 \u0026ldquo;I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel; For He is the living God and enduring forever, And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed, And His dominion will be forever.\nNebuchadnezzar forbade blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (3:29); Darius orders all people to tremble and fear before Him (v. 26).\nThe king’s declaration of God’s greatness would have promulgated a healthy fear of God throughout the Persian Empire\nDaniel 6:27# Dan 6:27 \u0026ldquo;He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders In heaven and on earth, Who has also delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.\u0026rdquo;\nThe king spoke of God’s power to save. He included Daniel’s deliverance from the lions as living proof of God’s delivering power.\nHeb 11:33 who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions,\nDaniel 6:28# Dan 6:28 So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.\nGod gave Daniel success in a pagan regime.\na. This event happened just prior to the end of Israel’s prophesied seventy years of captivity.\nb. King Cyrus would soon encourage Israel’s return to the land.\nc. Did Daniel’s testimony of faith in God, his integrity, and the exposing of his conspirators play a part in Cyrus’ positive actions toward the exiles of Israel?\nd. The stage was set for Jewish refugees to return to the Promised Land. Since Daniel, who represented the best of Israel, was seen as loyal to his adoptive government, the Jewish people would not be perceived as subversive or threating to the kingdom.\nA note on Darius and Cyrus# Jesus authenticated prophet Daniel \u0026ldquo;Let the reader understand\u0026rdquo;\nDarius was appointed king by someone greater (Cyrus de Great) Daniel 9:1\nDan 9:1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans —\nThis shows how the bear in chapter 7 perfectly reflects the Medo-Persian empire. The Persian part was above the Median. Cyrus the Great the overall king and Darius the Mede was king over the province of the Chaldeans or Babylon.\nDarius’ reign and Cyrus’ reign are the same not successive.\n"},{

      "content":"This is the account of Nebuchadnezzar\u0026rsquo;s Image - False Worship\nMan by default is religious. He will bow to something. God created man in his image. Mankind creates gods in their image. Romans 1:18-32\nWorshipping God in our own way is also adultery.\nEven though we might not bow down to any statue we can \u0026lsquo;bow\u0026rsquo; to gods in our hearts and minds.\nWhy did Nebuchadnezzar build this image? He was thinking about this since God spoke to him in the dream and visions, except he distorted it to his own benefit.\nIs it possible that Nebuchadnezzar was dreaming of building a statue before God spoke to him? Certainly somehow they are related. Did God meet Nebuchadnezzar where he was at or did Nebuchadnezzar twist what God had said to his favour, so that all rule will be his?\nAt the end of Daniel 4, Nebuchadnezzar apparently believes in God, but at this point he is still ignorant of the all sovereign God of the universe. Nebuchadnezzar is thinking his is the greatest power.\nDan 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, the height of which was sixty cubits and its width six cubits; he set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.\n60x6 = 10 to 1. This is the dimensions of obelisks.\nDan 3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent word to assemble the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\nBabylon\u0026rsquo;s way is work the top and move down\nDan 3:3 Then the satraps, the prefects and the governors, the counselors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates and all the rulers of the provinces were assembled for the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nRev 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth committed acts ofimmorality, and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.\u0026quot;\nRev 18:3 \u0026ldquo;For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed acts ofimmorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.\u0026rdquo;\nDan 3:4 Then the herald loudly proclaimed: \u0026ldquo;To you the command is given, O peoples, nations and men of every language,\nFirst the leaders, now get the people to follow. Everybody drinks of Babylon\u0026rsquo;s wine.\nDan 3:5 that at the moment you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up.\nMusic is also used a lot within pagan worship.\nDan 3:6 \u0026ldquo;But whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.\u0026rdquo;\nWorship or be burned\nDan 3:7 Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, bagpipe and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.\nThe sound of music is generally associated with gladness. This was brought on from idolatry. God will destroy all music from Babylon becuase of her idolatry and treatment of God\u0026rsquo;s people over the ages.\nRevelation 18:22, \u0026ldquo;And the sound of harpists, musicians, flute players, and trumpeters will never be heard in you again; and no craftsman of any craft will ever be found in you again; and the sound of a mill will never be heard in you again;\u0026rdquo;\nDan 3:8 For this reason at that time certain Chaldeans came forward and brought charges against the Jews.\nChaldeans don\u0026rsquo;t like these three men being superior\nDan 3:9 They responded and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king: \u0026ldquo;O king, live forever!\nThey respected the king God had placed.\nDan 3:10 \u0026ldquo;You, O king, have made a decree that every man who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, psaltery, and bagpipe and all kinds of music, is to fall down and worship the golden image.\nRev 18:16 saying, \u0026lsquo;Woe, woe, the great city, she who was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls;\nDan 3:11 \u0026ldquo;But whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast into the midst of a furnace of blazing fire.\nWorship or die. Death motivates the world becuase death reigns. Romans 5:12-21\nDan 3:12 \u0026ldquo;There are certain Jews whom you have appointed over the administration of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego. These men, O king, have disregarded you; they do not serve your gods or worship the golden image which you have set up.\u0026rdquo;\nSome mistakenly say that the statue was about worshipping him but verse 14 clearly shows it was to \u0026lsquo;his gods\u0026rsquo;.\nDaniel 3:14 - Nebuchadnezzar says \u0026lsquo;Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image that I have set up?\u0026rsquo;\n"},{

      "content":"Learning from Grief# It\u0026rsquo;s easy to doubt God when things don\u0026rsquo;t go well (Psalm 77:1-9) Knowing God\u0026rsquo;s true self provides a framework around our chaos (Psalm 77:10-14) Christ is our life (Psalm 77:15) Psalm 77# I. Psalm 77:1-6 Asaph doubts God# (For the choir director; according to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph.)\nPsa 77:1 My voice rises to God, and I will cry aloud; My voice rises to God, and He will hear me.# The Psalmist goes to God. He cries out to God. God is who will listen. In the midst of uncontrollable hurt, trauma, frustration when we can\u0026rsquo;t even make sense of our own thoughts and are flooded with emotion, I have found this Psalm to provide guidance and great encouragement.\nPsa 77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness; My soul refused to be comforted.# Sleepless nights, troubled, no comfort in sight sound familiar? I believe believers all experience some form of grief at one time or another. To experience Sickness, be jobless, lose a loved one. We find ourselves overwhelmed by profound sorrow, but also stress, anxiety, depression. This is all too familiar these days Psa 77:3 When I remember God, then I am disturbed; When I sigh, then my spirit grows faint. Selah.# The thought of God can become disturbing, (disturbing: to be in great commotion or tumult, to rage, war, moan, clamor) We know God is over all. God is all powerful. Why does God allow this in my life? It\u0026rsquo;s easy to become convinced God is not on top of things. God has changed. God is upset at me because i\u0026rsquo;m less than perfect. Every time God comes to mind, it is disrupting. Not happy. I need happy. Happy thoughts. Not this, spiritual christians aren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to feel this. Thoughts of God can be the last thing we feel we need. Know this is real. I\u0026rsquo;d never doubt God, God could never disturb me\u0026hellip;put it this way, have you ever shunned away from getting into Scripture for fear of what you might find? The psalmist went through it. Psa 77:4 Thou hast held my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak.# This is not a statement of resignation or of trust but an accusation. God has caused him to be troubled and now he\u0026rsquo;s speechless. Psa 77:5 I have considered the days of old, The years of long ago.# here Asaph begins comparing his present situation with the \u0026lsquo;good ol days\u0026rsquo;. Kind of like Israel when they thought about Egypt. Like me saying I was better off before I began walking with the Lord. Someone might say, never say that! God might strike you dead with lightning! That is not the Psalmists approach. Psa 77:6 I will remember my song in the night; I will meditate with my heart; And my spirit ponders.# Asaph is singing the blues in Aminor. This is not the same tune Paul and Silas are singing while in the Jail at Filipi. II. Psalm 77:7-9 Asaph\u0026rsquo;s Six questions about God# These are deep, existential questions. The Psalmist leads us into six foundational questions he asked in the time of grief. Psa 77:7 Will the Lord reject forever? And will He never be favorable again? (Rom 11:1-2)# Presumption: 1. God has rejected me 2. This situation will last forever 3. God has withdrawn whatever he once gave me.\nRom 11:1 I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? May it never be! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. Rom 11:2 God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?\nPsa 77:8 Has His lovingkindness ceased forever? Has His promise come to an end forever? (Núm 23:19)# Presumption: 1. God has ceased being loving to me 2. God does not keep His promises 3. Gods acceptance must be earned. 4. God doesn’t always keep his promises\nNum 23:19 \u0026quot;God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent; Has He said, and will He not do it? Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?\nPsa 77:9 Has God forgotten to be gracious? Or has He in anger withdrawn His compassion? Selah.# Presumption: 1. God has forgotten about me 2. My problem is too big for God 3. God is not good enough 4. God is angry at me 5. I have failed\nIsa 40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and assert, O Israel, \u0026quot;My way is hidden from the LORD, And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God\u0026quot;? Isa 40:28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth Does not become weary or tired. His understanding is inscrutable.\nJacob went through this and never seemed to come out the other side. Summary: We can surmise that the pain in this persons life made him doubt and question God’s character. He is confronted with an experience that is seemingly too much for God. God is perceived to be angry perhaps suggesting there must also be personal guilt.\nthere can be no question as to this: Situations like these are far more than Asaph can handle, you and I either. It is not as though God is testing you to see if you are resolute enough, strong enough. ##III. Psalm 77:10-14 A corrected perspective of the Character of God\nPsa 77:10 Then I said, \u0026ldquo;It is my grief, That the right hand of the Most High has changed.\u0026rdquo;# Psa 73:21 When my heart was embittered And I was pierced within, Psa 73:22 Then I was senseless and ignorant; I was like a beast before You.\nPsa 77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity…KJV\n“The meaning of this phrase is not, as would appear from our translation, that his reflections on the subject were to be traced to his weakness, or were a proof of weakness of mind, but that the subject overpowered him.” - Barnes\nThe Psalmist\u0026rsquo;s line of questioning leads to a conclusive answer: preposterous! God is not unfaithful, God is good, God will never leave or forsake, God is a jealous God (He deeply desires you), God is love, God is kind, God is compassionate, His mercies are new every morning, God is seeking out to be known by you, deeply, truly, wonderfully.\nAsaph knows enough to conclude none of his presumptions are founded in reality but only in his sentiment of the present experience. He identifies the problem The true cause of his state becomes apparent. You see we can truly rejoice in the midst of troubles. Not because we have the willpower but because we know God is good and he uses all our circumstances for good.\nThe Psalmist has been so preoccupied with his affliction that he has lost faith in the goodness and grace of God. Look how often the psalmist uses the words ‘I’ and ‘me’ in this psalm. By doing so removed his focus on God. The point is not \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t be like Asaph\u0026rdquo;. Rather if/when you find yourself in this some day, if you\u0026rsquo;re here today and God seems distant even angry, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. -Asaph thus acknowledges that the problem does not lie with God, but with his overwhelming grief causing God to seem altogether different.\nPsalm 77:11 I shall remember the deeds of the LORD; Surely I will remember Thy wonders of old.# Psalm 77:12 I will meditate on all Thy work, And muse on Thy deeds.# Psa 77:13 Thy way, O God, is holy; What god is great like our God?# God is holy but also his way is holy Psa 77:14 Thou art the God who workest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples.# God has clearly shown his great strength to all. in fact he does this daily through creation.\nPsalmist turns his attention to God as revealing himself through history. Psalmist remembers, meditates, muses on God\nIII. Psalm 77:15 God is who Gives life# Psa 77:15 Thou hast by Thy power redeemed Thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.# Jacob vs Joseph\nthe story of Jacob vs Joseph is telling. Both went through grief. Jacob lost his son while Joseph lost everything and was sold into slavery. Both experienced grief in their lives. Joseph\nGen 45:7 \u0026quot;**God** sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.\nGen 50:20 \u0026quot;As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive. Gen 50:21 \u0026quot;So therefore, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and your little ones.\u0026quot; So he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.\nJacob\nGen 46:3 He said, \u0026quot;**I am God, the God of your father;**\nGen 44:29 'If you take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.'\nGen 46:29 Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel; as soon as he appeared before him, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a long time. Gen 46:30 Then Israel said to Joseph, \u0026quot;Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.\u0026quot;\nboth Jacob and Joseph are among those redeemed. Yet one saw God using the trial for good while the other failed to see God because of the trial. Gen 45:7 \u0026quot;**God** sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance\nGen 44:30 ”since his life is bound up in the lad's life…”\nRom 8:32 He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things? IV. Psalm 77:16-20 Two examples of God working in the past# Psa 77:16 The waters saw Thee, O God; The waters saw Thee, they were in anguish; The deeps also trembled.# Psa 77:17 The clouds poured out water; The skies gave forth a sound; Thy arrows flashed here and there.# Psa 77:18 The sound of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lit up the world; The earth trembled and shook.# is Asaph alluding to the flood? Why? Because even in the worldwide destruction at the flood, God never ceased being who he is. Psa 77:19 Thy way was in the sea, And Thy paths in the mighty waters, And Thy footprints may not be known.# Psa 77:20 Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.# God miraculously saved Israel from Egypt in the Red Sea. Isa 52:10 The LORD has bared His holy arm In the sight of all the nations, That all the ends of the earth may see The salvation of our God. V. Conclusion# Jacob: his life was wrapped up in the life of his son\nJoseph: God used circumstances intended for evil by others for the ultimate good of mankind\nUs: wrapped up in Gods son.\nCol 3:1 Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Col 3:2 Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. Col 3:3 For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. Col 3:4 When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s easy to doubt and question God when things don\u0026rsquo;t go well (Psalm 77:1-9) Knowing God\u0026rsquo;s true self (as revealed in Scripture), provides a framework around our chaos (Psalm 77:10-14) Christ is our life (Psalm 77:15) Eph 6:13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. .\n"},{

      "content":"Romans 16:26 - Obedience of Faith# I would like to take a moment to look at the phrase obedience of faith.\nBefore we look at what it means, and since Paul mentions this phrase at the beginning and at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, we should look at his purpose for writing:\n``` So, for my part, I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. Romans 1:15``\nObedience is a noun not a verb. This is a term or definition, a title or description. It could describe the action or what results from the action.\n\u0026lsquo;But now\u0026rsquo; making a distinction to that what was previous not known (v.25), kept a secret for ages past.\n\u0026lsquo;Is manifested\u0026rsquo; refers back to the Gospel (the person and work of Jesus Christ) (v.25). We could paraphrase the verse (taking the liberty) \u0026lsquo;but now [the gospel] is manifested to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith\u0026rsquo;.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look to Scripture to help us interpret this. We know that Paul\u0026rsquo;s purpose of writing Romans is to communicate the Gospel. How are obedience, faith and the Gospel connected?\nWe see in the beginning of the church that many of the priests were becoming obedient:\n``` The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith. Acts 6:7``\nThose who are obedient, are given the Holy Spirit:\n``` And we are witnesses of these things; and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.” Acts 5:32``\nWe also see that there are those who do not obey the Gospel:\n``` dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. 2 Thessalonians 1:8``\nSo, we arrive at the question, how is is that one is obedient or disobedient in regards to the Gospel? The Gospel of John may shed some light:\n``` He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” John 3:36``\nClearly salvation is not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). So salvation is not on the basis of doing or performing. Those who don\u0026rsquo;t believe are considered disobedient however.\n``` obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. 1 Peter 1:9``\nPeter uses it again in the same chapter to show how believers are title or identification of \u0026lsquo;obedient children\u0026rsquo;:\nAs obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts *which were yours* in your ignorance, 1 Peter 1:14\nObedience of faith could also be stated, \u0026lsquo;obedience which is faith\u0026rsquo; when faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God (Romans 10:17).\nGod has gifted to every person the possibility to exercise faith. After hearing the message of the Gospel, they must trust, rest, believe it!\nThey said, “**Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved**, you and your household.\u0026quot; Acts 16:31\nPaul (as an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles) desired that the preaching of the Gospel might be responded to by faith thereby bringing about the declaration of them being obedient. Those who have been declared obedient, those who have trusted in what Christ did for them - dying for our sins and rising again, are to walk now by faith in their identity of obedient children.\nIf you have not made the decision to trust Christ personally - that he saved you from the penalty of your sin, you are considered disobedient before God and He will have to punish you. Trust Him by faith and find forgiveness of your sins today!\n"},{

      "content":"The term repentance comes with all sorts of different ideas. By doing a simple search on the internet we find it summed up in words like \u0026ldquo;remorse, contrition, contriteness, penitence, sorrow, regret\u0026rdquo;.\nMost would agree that this is what is meant when we use repentance/repent in our day to day use of the word. Probably the religious association is there for most. What I am tryng to look at in this note is how the Bible uses what we see translated as the word repentance in the English Bible. Why? Because word studies are good, they allow us to focus on how the word was used in Scripture, possibly how it was used during that time period it was written and also because words change their meaning over time. Perhaps the word was never intended as we understand it today.\nRegarding how words change their meaning over time, modern dictionaries continually update their word definitions based on contemporary usage of words as well as keeping the origin.\nMany Bible scholars admit that the word METANOIA translated originally to Latin and later from the Latin translated into English as repentance in a unfortunate. Luther says this\u0026hellip;\n“in no way does this do justice to the Greek.” (Luther’s Works , 48:67–68 John the Baptist# Mat 3:1 Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,\nMat 3:2 \u0026ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat did John mean when he called those in Judea to repent?\nMat 3:3 For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, \u0026ldquo;THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE WILDERNESS, \u0026lsquo;MAKE READY THE WAY OF THE LORD, MAKE HIS PATHS STRAIGHT!\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nA clue is seen in the phrase, \u0026ldquo;make ready the way of the Lord..\u0026rdquo;\nMat 3:4 Now John himself had a garment of camel\u0026rsquo;s hair and a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.\nMat 3:5 Then Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan;\nMat 3:6 and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.\nMat 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, \u0026ldquo;You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?\nInterestingly, Pharisees and Sadducees were taken by all this activity and wanted to join in. John speaks of \u0026lsquo;fleeing from the wrath to come\u0026rsquo;. What were they doing? They were following in doing whatever the people were doing.\nMat 3:8 \u0026ldquo;Therefore bear fruit in keeping with repentance;\nThe fruit of in keeping with repentance, that is those who had repented (whatever that is to mean), was being baptized and confessing their sins.\nMat 3:9 and do not suppose that you can say to yourselves, \u0026lsquo;We have Abraham for our father\u0026rsquo;; for I say to you that from these stones God is able to raise up children to Abraham.\nJohn brings to their attention what he is referring to. They thought (supposed) that by having Abraham as their forefather that they children of God. John shows the mistake in their thinking.\nMat 3:10 \u0026ldquo;The axe is already laid at the root of the trees; therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Mat 3:11 \u0026ldquo;As for me, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. Mat 3:12 \u0026ldquo;His winnowing fork is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor; and He will gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are two options when Jesus (Messiah) comes. He will baptize with the Holy Spirit (birthing children of God) and baptize by fire (judgment). John says I baptize you with water for repentance. Paul comments on this\u0026hellip;\nPaul said, \u0026ldquo;John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.\u0026rdquo; Acts 19:4\nJohn the Baptist, in preaching to the Judeans, calls them to repentance because the kingdom of heaven is near. The people were getting baptized because they had believed in Him who was coming after him. They were \u0026lsquo;preparing the way\u0026rsquo; and in an outward sign of that as \u0026lsquo;fruit\u0026rsquo; they were being baptized and confessing their sin.\nThe Pharisees and Sadducees had neither understood the message or believed in the He who would come after John, they were simply doing what felt like a good thing since all the people were doing it. They had supposed incorrectly. They needed to change their presupposition and consider John\u0026rsquo;s message.\n"},{

      "content":" But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth. 1 Timothy 4:1-3\nI am currently teaching through the book of 1 Timothy. Paul\u0026rsquo;s instructions to his disciple Timothy are of increadible value due to what is taught regarding the nature of the church.\nThe church of Jesus Christ is the upholder and defender of truth. However he explains to Timothy how he should conduct himself in the household of God. The church is presented as a houshold. God\u0026rsquo;s family that should be run as a functional (vs disfunctional) family. The leaders are to be well acquainted with family life as a condition for becoming leaders.\nThen in chapter 4 Paul reminds of Timothy of how the Holy Spirit had said that in later times people would come along who were used of demons to teach things contrary to the truth. It seems rather strange that their \u0026lsquo;great heresy\u0026rsquo; was to teach against marriage and eating. This does not seem so bad in light of all we see going on around us. Especially regarding deceptive teaching that leads people astray\u0026hellip;or wait\u0026hellip;maybe he IS talking about deceptive things using family examples.\nThe Attack# Marriage is the foundation of a family. When a man and a woman get married a new family is born. Often times children are born and are incorporated into that family.\nEating is key because we usually eat three times a day. That makes about 1095 times we are together as a family enjoying a meal together and enjoying eachother\u0026rsquo;s company. The family aspect of the household of God was under attack. These deceivers were introducing false aspects that strayed them away from the family aspect.\n"},{

      "title": "Two Instructors",
      "content":"Two Instructors# -by John Wry\nThe New Testament mentions two instructors, two trainers. One is referred to as instructor law and the other is referred to as instructor grace.\nWhile it is true that law can mean the time period in which Israel lived and now we are under grace, that is not what I am referring to here. Law can mean many things namely; civil law, a principle, a specific law, 10 commandments, or legalism. Legalism is the definition I will speak of here.\nWhy do I mean by legalism? It is the attitude of the heart seeking to earn God\u0026rsquo;s blessing, justification and sanctification through any other means that is not by faith alone in Christ alone.\nA bit of my background# I have been thinking a bit lately about how I assumed the law for many years to be \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; truth. That is, those believers still speaking about grace, was to my understanding, a clear evidence of their lack of \u0026lsquo;spiritual depth\u0026rsquo;. I\u0026rsquo;d say to myself \u0026lsquo;ah he\u0026rsquo;s a newbie\u0026rsquo;. To say it a different way, unless a believer had learned to live under the burden of weight taught by the law, he or she was (to me) essentially immature and was yet needing to be \u0026lsquo;illuminated\u0026rsquo; by the \u0026lsquo;meat of the Word\u0026rsquo;. Someone who talks about God\u0026rsquo;s love and God\u0026rsquo;s grace all the time was clearly (and according to my theology) either lacking in willpower and resolve and, to put it in a picture, still on christian training wheels. In my theology, \u0026rsquo;true\u0026rsquo; Christian \u0026lsquo;depth\u0026rsquo; came through my \u0026lsquo;abandon\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;obedience\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;sacrifice\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;submission\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;resolve\u0026rsquo;. Those things have a way of sounding good but the more I focused on them, the harder it got, the more frustrated I felt and ultimately had to be honest and admit defeat. To admit defeat or to come to terms with the reality that I could not do it, was actually perhaps my first step forward. I needed to be taught a new way.\nIt was not until I was introduced to healthy doctrine of Scripture, that I began to understand there was a very different way. The Scripture was teaching it all along I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t listening because I was too busy reading my \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; meaning into it. I was too busy being \u0026rsquo;the guide to the blind\u0026rsquo; to be teachable, too busy doing my best for Jesus to see God\u0026rsquo;s provision of Jesus.\nTwo Teachings# In the book of Galatians, Paul brings out that the law is a schoolmaster or instructor. In Titus, God\u0026rsquo;s grace is also stated as an instructor. However the two (though both are perfect) are very different in purpose.\nThese are two teachers that bring with them two different teachings. The law teaches or instructs about needing righteousness and points to Christ but produces a sense of condemnation, an understanding of one\u0026rsquo;s reality before God but not a solution.\nGrace also has an instruction. It teaches, explains, illustrates to us how God wishes to produce in us his heart through His solution, Jesus Christ who gave himself to be condemned so we could have life. Titus says it is God\u0026rsquo;s grace that trains us in authentic righteous living. It shows forth Christ and His work. It is by far a loftier, higher, more sublime way (Gal 5:4).\nThey are two different teachings to two different audiences.\nTwo Audiences# In 1 Timothy, Paul explains that the teaching of the law or the appropriate use of the law is for the unrighteous. In Galatians he explains how the law\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to lead to Christ and how when one believes in the work of deliverance of Christ, he is not under that instructor. In fact, Romans 7 tells us that to place oneself under the law is to place oneself under our former master and in the illustration of marriage Paul gives, metaphorically to commit spiritual adultery.\nAccording to Titus, the appropriate audience for the instruction of grace is for those who have seen (or understood) His grace and trusted in Christ. It is to them that grace becomes an instructor, teaching how to let go of sinful ways and how to live in real, authentic, integral piety. The law cannot do this, it is weakened, not because of it\u0026rsquo;s source (God) or that it has a flaw but it fails to produce Christian piety because of the flesh. The flesh is activated by the law. Therefore, when we died with Christ, we were made to die to the law (Romans 7:4) so that we might bear fruit unto God.\nA better way# Obviously God\u0026rsquo;s way is the right way and any other way falls short. Colossians states, to submit to decrees, to man-made ways of becoming spiritual is failure because it has no power over the flesh\u0026rsquo;s powerful enslavement. Paul says in Galatians, the only way is to stand firm. The interesting thing is that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026lsquo;stand firm in your resolve\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;stand firm in the law\u0026rsquo;. No, he says \u0026lsquo;stand firm in the grace of God\u0026rsquo; or hold on tightly to God\u0026rsquo;s grace lest you become slaves again. This slavery in the context of Galatians would come through once again putting oneself under the instruction of the law.\nIn Conclusion# The more I search, the more I see how God is softly and continuously saying to stand firm in His grace. This is taught throughout Scripture.\nPerhaps we should not seek to be \u0026lsquo;deeper\u0026rsquo; but \u0026lsquo;higher\u0026rsquo;. Perhaps the ways of man only interrupt what God really wants to do in the life of the believer? Perhaps putting on the yoke of the law is really slavery after all and only produces self-condemnation, frustration and ultimate defeat even though it has the outward appearance of spiritual. Paul said it was the law that resulted (due to the flesh) in his death or separation from God.\nNo, I\u0026rsquo;m going to go out on a limb and say I\u0026rsquo;ll trust God\u0026rsquo;s grace to be my teacher. I\u0026rsquo;ll trust it because that\u0026rsquo;s what I see Scripture says is God\u0026rsquo;s provision to conform me to the image of Christ. I will sit under her instruction. I will look to her for understanding I will hang on tight to her every word. I am grateful to the law for clearly showing me my need but now grace is teaching me how Christ supplies all in all.\nAs I look back in my own life as a believer, I can clearly see the instruction received by grace has made all the difference for good in my life.\nWho\u0026rsquo;s teaching do you sit under, Law\u0026rsquo;s or Grace\u0026rsquo;s?\n"},{

      "title": "You are Teaching &#39;Easy Believism&#39;",
      "content":"You are Teaching \u0026lsquo;Easy Believism\u0026rsquo;# Just recently, I received a kind accusation of teaching \u0026rsquo;easy believism\u0026rsquo;. I was asked three questions.\nAre believers different to disciples? So, this is my more formal response - a work in progress but perhaps it might shed some light for others that are tragically caught in the midst of this divide.\nFirst off, I ask myself, what do people mean by the term \u0026lsquo;easy believism\u0026rsquo;? A quick search on the internet returns the following as a first option\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Easy believism is a somewhat derogatory term used by opponents of the view that one needs only to believe in Jesus in order to be saved. From this they conclude that those who hold to sola fide teach that no corresponding need exists for a committed life of Christian discipleship as proof of salvation; however, that is not what sola fide means. True faith in Christ will always lead to a changed life. Another common usage of the term easy believism is in regards to those who believe they’re saved because they prayed a prayer—with no real conviction of sin and no real faith in Christ. Praying a prayer is easy—thus the term easy believism—but there is more to salvation than mouthing words.\u0026rdquo; 1\nAccording to this short definition, there seems to be at least two different options; \u0026ldquo;that one needs only to believe in Jesus in order to be saved\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;those who believe they\u0026rsquo;re saved because they prayed a prayer - with no real conviction of sin and no real faith in Christ\u0026rdquo;.\nBiblically, I it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to find that praying a prayer, with or without real conviction of sin, saves anyone anyway, so that is not an option I wish to persue within the scope of this article.\nPaul said,\nand may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, Philippians 3:9\nThat leaves us with only one possibly definition to discuss, \u0026ldquo;that one needs only to believe in Jesus in order to be saved\u0026rdquo;.\nDaniel Fuller of Fuller Theological Seminary states,\nGenuine faith must go beyond the mere intellectual assent concerning biblical doctrines. People must let the implications of these doctrines radically affect their hearts so that they respond positively to God with the obedience and works of faith. 2\nSo, according to Fuller, when Scripture says \u0026ldquo;believe,\u0026rdquo; he understands it to mean \u0026ldquo;obedience and works of faith\u0026rdquo;.\nJohn MacArthur, one who has popularized the notion that one must make Christ Lord as a condition for salvation states,\nThe gospel according to Jesus explicitly and unequivocally rules out easy-believism. To make all of our Lord’s difficult demands apply only to a higher class of Christians blunts the force of His entire message. It makes room for a cheap and meaningless faith – a faith that may be exercised with absolutely no impact on the fleshly life of sin. That is not saving faith.3\nBy this, I believe MacArthur is saying \u0026ldquo;saving faith\u0026rdquo; has to cost you at least a change from a \u0026ldquo;fleshly life of sin\u0026rdquo;, otherwise it simply is not going to save you. I would just quickly interject a counterthought that faith does not save, Christ does, but evidently MacAuthur believes that Christ will not save unless you\u0026rsquo;ve earned the right to receive the forgiveness of sins. I thought grace had to be free in order to still be by definition grace. But before I come across as \u0026lsquo;cheeky\u0026rsquo;, let\u0026rsquo;s move on\u0026hellip;\nMark Talbot adds his opinion to the topic:\nAmerican Christianity tends toward a kind of “easy-believism.” The Gospel is often presented in a way that suggests that someone is saved as soon as he or she has “accepted” Jesus as Savior, even if that “acceptance” never manifests itself in the emotional and volitional recentering of the person’s entire life. But this is actually the paradigm of the sort of dead and fruitless faith that the whole New Testament condemns.4\nOne sums it up in a catch phrase\u0026hellip;\nAlthough a Christian should believe simply, he should not “simply believe.”5\nWho do We Turn to? Who can Help us Decide?# All of these definitions sound convincing, logical and familiar. One might be convinced at this point, but before you close this article, let\u0026rsquo;s check, just in case, do they stand the litmus test of Scripture?\nWe owe to ourselves to know the truth, not just hearing people\u0026rsquo;s opinions. If we are not willing to search the Scriptures carefully, we will spent our time arguing over who\u0026rsquo;s argument, tradition and norms are better and utimately he who argues best, wins (the argument is won but the truth has eluded us).\nA Real issue or Merely Semantics?# Ryrie cautions:\nthat the message of faith only and the message of faith plus commitment of life cannot both be the gospel; therefore, one of them is a false gospel and comes under the curse of perverting the gospel or preaching another gospel (Gal. 1:6–9). As far as sanctification is concerned, if only committed people are saved people, then where is there room for carnal Christians? (p. 170).6\nCarnal Christians# Does the Bible state the possibility of a believer being carnal?\n1Co 3:1 And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men of flesh, as to infants in Christ.\n1Co 3:2 I gave you milk to drink, not solid food; for you were not yet able to receive it. Indeed, even now you are not yet able,\n1Co 3:3 for you are still fleshly. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not walking like mere men?\nNotice the term Paul used, infants in Christ. I submit to you that that is not only of believers who have backslidden (as was the case of [some of] the Corinthian believers) or never grown but in fact infant does imply newborn. In other words, The Lordship of Jesus Christ is not yet realized in the infant in Christ, however he undoubtedly is in Christ. This cannot be ignored in the midst of a heated argument of which argument \u0026lsquo;sounds more logical\u0026rsquo;.\nLest I fail to mention at a later point\u0026hellip;\nEph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;\nEph 2:9 not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\nSalvation is not of ourselves. It is not the amount of our faith, the duration of our faith, the quality of our faith that saves and certainly not our works. It is God who saves. In fact salvation is a un unmerited gift. A gift by definition is free of charge or merit.\nFaith is not a work\nRom 4:5 But to the one who does not work, but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,\nSo again, it\u0026rsquo;s not the quantity, quality or duration of faith that saves but who faith is placed on. \u0026ldquo;But to the one who\u0026hellip; believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness\u0026rdquo;. Not kind of faith but faith in Jesus as the one who justifies the ungodly.\nAbsolute Righteousness not Resolute Willpower# Isa 64:6 For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.\nIf our righteounesses (our \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; works) are like a filthy garments and we are unclean, how can we, who are the problem, turn our life around, make a resolution to never \u0026lsquo;practice\u0026rsquo; sin, abandon a sinful lifestyle to lead a \u0026lsquo;pure\u0026rsquo; life that is pleasing to God? This is totally undermining God\u0026rsquo;s absolute righteousness, God\u0026rsquo;s holiness and God\u0026rsquo;s hatred of sin. How can God bring his righeousness down to man\u0026rsquo;s level so he can do something \u0026lsquo;smallish\u0026rsquo; and yet \u0026lsquo;doable\u0026rsquo;? How can sinful man do anything sort of \u0026lsquo;good\u0026rsquo; like make a resolute decision for willpower over sin and be considered perfect by God? This is absolutely ludicrous and blasfemous to why Jesus would have to die in the first place.\nGal 3:10 For as many as are of the works of the Law are under a curse; for it is written, \u0026ldquo;CURSED IS EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT ABIDE BY ALL THINGS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE LAW, TO PERFORM THEM.\u0026rdquo;\nGod never stooped in his righteousness. God never lowered his standard. Instead what He did was send His Son who fulfilled the righteousness of God on our behalf.\n2Co 5:21 He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.\nGod did that already. It\u0026rsquo;s done. The only thing that\u0026rsquo;s needed is for it to be credited to my account. This is promised to those who believe in Him.\nRom 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? \u0026ldquo;ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, AND IT WAS CREDITED TO HIM AS RIGHTEOUSNESS.\u0026rdquo;\nWho are Truly His Disciples?# Is God\u0026rsquo;s Ultimate Intention to find Subjugates\nIt may surprise you that I ask this, but Scriptures states that all will ultimately bow a knew to Christ and recognize he is Lord of lords and King of kings. There are many who call him \u0026ldquo;Lord, Lord\u0026rdquo; but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know them.\nActually, God is looking for worshippers\u0026hellip;\nJohn 4:23 \u0026ldquo;But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers.\nWhile it is true God is looking for worshippers (those who give homage to), it is they who worship in spirit and truth. It is those who want (spirit) and those who worship according to reality (truth) that God is looking for.\nRevelation 19:1 After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, \u0026ldquo;Hallelujah!
