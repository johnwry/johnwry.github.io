Title: Got my song back
---



well I got my song back

Not that I ever had it

but now that i got it

I don't ever wanna let it go



well I got my song back

Not that I ever had it

but now that i got it

I don't ever wanna let it go



'cus it's not in the sun

Not in the moon

Not in the starts 

though they're pretty in the sky

nothing in what I do

I've been a fool to think I could
