be saved in spite of their sin.

1. The scope of his act (5:15b, 18b)

A. They have been crucified with Christ (6:1-3).

B. They have been resurrected with Christ (6:4-5).

1. Dead to their sin (6:6-7): We should no longer be slaves to sin, for we have been crucified with

Christ.

2. Alive in the Savior (6:8-10): We are now to live in the resurrection power of the one who rose

from the dead and is forever alive.

II. STEP 2-RECKON (6:11): We are to count our crucifixion and resurrection as accomplished events.

III. STEP 3-YIELD (6:12-23): Paul describes two kinds of yielding.

A. The wrong kind (6:12-13a): We are not to yield the members of our body as tools of wickedness.

B. The right kind (6:13b-23)

1. The confusion (6:15a): "Since God's grace has set us free from the law, does this mean we

can go on sinning?"

2. The correction (6:15b-18): "Of course not! Don't you realize that whatever you choose to obey

becomes your master? You can choose sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey

God and receive his approval."

3. The challenge (6:13b-14, 19-22): We are to yield the members of our body as tools of

righteousness.

4. The conclusion (6:23)

b. "The free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord" (6:23b).

SECTION OUTLINE SEVEN (ROMANS 7)

Paul discusses how the law of God applies to and affects three kinds of people.

I. SPIRITUAL PEOPLE AND THE LAW (7:1-6)

A. Their relationship to the law (7:1-3, 5)

1. They are like widows freed from their husbands (7:1-3).
2. They are like dead men freed from their lusts (7:5).

B. Their relationship to the Savior (7:4, 6)

1. They have been raised by Christ (7:4a, 6): They are released from the law.
2. They are now to produce fruit through Christ (7:4b): Thus spiritual people are delivered from

the law.

II. NATURAL PEOPLE AND THE LAW (7:7-13): The law is used in a twofold manner.

A. The illustration usage (7:7, 10): God used the law to reveal the sinfulness of the flesh.

B. The condemnation usage (7:8-9, 11-13): Sin used the law to rekindle the sinfulness of the flesh.

Thus natural people are doomed by the law.

Ill. CARNAL PEOPLE AND THE LAW (7:14-26)

A. Paul has learned that any attempt to keep the law leads to carnality (7:14-23).

1. The confusion (7:14-16): Paul's frustration is twofold.

a. He doesn't do the things he wants to do (7:14-15a, 16a).

b. He does the things he doesn't want to do (7:15b, 16b).

2. The corruption (7:17-20): He realizes the total corruption of his old sinful nature.
3. The conclusion (7:21-23): He understands the daily struggle within him.

b. The new nature, always attempting to do right (7:21b-22)

B. Paul has learned that no attempt to keep the law can lead to spirituality (7:24-25).

1. The agony of Paul's problem (7:24): "What a miserable person I am! Who will free me from

this life that is dominated by sin?"

2. The answer to Paul's problem (7:25): "Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord."

5SECTION OUTLINE EIGHT (ROMANS 8)

A. Our position in regard to the Son of God (8:1-3): The believer is in Christ.

1. The miracle involved (8:1, 3a): Believers receive no condemnation and are freed from sin and

death.

2. The means involved (8:2, 3b): This was accomplished not through the Law of Moses but by

the death of Christ.

SECTION OUTLINE NINE (ROMANS 9)

In the next three chapters, Paul overviews God's threefold dealings with Israel. Here, he overviews the

sovereignty of God and Israel's selection in the past.

I. THE NINE SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:1-5)

A. Paul's grief over Israel (9:1-3): The apostle is so burdened over Israel's unbelief that he is willing

to suffer eternal damnation if that would help them come to Christ.

B. God's gifts to Israel (9:4-5)

1. They are a special nation (9:4a).
2. They have been adopted by God (9:4b, 5).
3. They have had God's glory revealed to them (9:4c).
4. They have been given the covenants (9:4d).
5. They have been given the law (9:4e).
6. They have the privilege of worshiping him (9:4f).
7. They have the messianic promises (9:4g).
8. They have a godly ancestry (9:5a).
9. They are the people from which Christ came (9:5b).

II. THE FIVE PERSONAL EXAMPLES OF THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:6-29)

A. The example of Ishmael and Isaac (9:6-10): God chose Isaac (Abraham's son through Sarah)

over Ishmael (Abraham's son through Hagar).

B. The example of Esau and Jacob (9:11-13)

1. What God did (9:12b-13): He chose Jacob (the second-born twin son of Isaac) over Esau (the

firstborn twin).

2. When God did it (9:11a, 12a): He made this choice long before they were even born.
3. Why God did it (9:11b): He did it to show that his sovereign decrees are not based on what

yet-unborn human beings might or might not do.

C. The example of Pharaoh (9:14-24)

1. The facts involved (9:15-18)

a. God determined to pardon sinful Israel with undeserved grace (9:15-16).

b. God determined to punish sinful Pharaoh with deserved judgment (9:17-18).

2. The fairness involved (9:14, 19-24)

a. In light of this, is God righteous? Yes! (9:14, 21-24).

(1) As a potter creates vessels, God creates nations (9:14, 21-22).

(2) As a potter controls those vessels, God controls nations (9:23-24).

b. In light of this, is man responsible? Yes! (9:19-20): As the vessels have no right to criticize

the potter, the nations have no right to criticize the Lord.

D. The example from Hosea (9:25-26): This Old Testament prophet predicted that God would not

limit his grace to Israel but would save repenting Gentile peoples; Hosea called these Gentiles

"children of the living God" (Hos. 2:23; 1:10).

7E. The example from Isaiah (9:27-29): Paul quotes from Isaiah to demonstrate God's sovereignty

concerning Israel.

1. Out of the millions of Israelites, only a small remnant will be saved (Isa. 10:22-23) (9:27-28).
2. Even the remnant would perish apart from the grace of God (Isa. 1:9) (9:29).

III. THE TWO GRAND CONCLUSIONS CONCERNING THIS SOVEREIGN SELECTION (9:30-33)

A. Through faith the Gentiles have found righteousness without even seeking it (9:30).

B. Through the law Israel has not found righteousness even after seeking it (9:31-33).

1. The seeking (9:31-32): They tried to be saved by works.
2. The stumbling (9:33): They have stumbled over Christ the rock, as predicted by Isaiah (Isa.

8:14; 28:16).

SECTION OUTLINE TEN (ROMANS 10)

I. THE PRAYER CONCERNING GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:1-3)

A. The prayer (10:1): Paul prays for Israel's salvation.

2. Works without faith (10:3b)

II. THE SOURCE OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:4-5)

A. It is found in Christ (10:4).

B. It was foretold by Moses (Lev. 18:5) (10:5).

III. THE AVAILABILITY OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:6-8)

A. Negative (10:6-7): One need not search the heavens or descend into the deep to find it.

B. Positive (10:8): It is, through Christ, as near as one's mouth and heart! Moses predicted this in

Deuteronomy 30:12-14.

IV. THE RECEPTION OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:9-10): Both one's heart and mouth are

involved.

A. It is conceived in the heart (10:9b-10a).

B. It is confirmed by the mouth (10:9a, 10b).

V. THE SCOPE OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:11-13)

A. It is impartial (10:11-12): It does not distinguish between Jews and Gentiles.

B. It is universal (10:13): Anyone calling on the name of the Lord will be saved.

VI. THE PRESENTATION OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:14-15): Paul presents a compelling case

for faithful witnessing.

A sinner must call on the Lord to be saved (10:14a).

B. A sinner must believe in order to call (10:14b).

C. A sinner must hear in order to believe (10:14c-15): Isaiah described the results: "How beautiful ...

are the feet of those who bring good news" (Isa. 52:7).

VII. THE REJECTION OF GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS (10:16-21)

A. Israel has heard the Good News (10:18): Paul proves this by quoting from Psalm 19:4.

B. Israel has refused to heed the Good News (10:16-17, 19-21).

1. Isaiah predicted this (10:16-17, 20-21): See Isaiah 53:1; 65:1-2.
2. Moses predicted this (10:19): See Deuteronomy 32:21.

8I. THIS FUTURE RESTORATION IS ASSURED BECAUSE ISRAEL'S PRESENT REJECTION IS

NOT TOTAL (11:1-10, 11b-24).

A. The factions of Israel (11:1-10): Paul divides Israel into two groups.

1. The minority group (11:1-6)
