Una esposa tiene el potencial de ser de gloria o derrota para su esposo...
Proverbs 12:4 - An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones.

Ephesians 5:31 - “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.”

Deuteronomy 24:5 - When a man is newly married, he shall not go out with the army or be liable for any other public duty. He shall be free at home one year to be happy with his wife whom he has taken.

Genesis 2:24 - Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

Matthew 19:4-6 - He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”

Proverbs 21:9 - It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.

Proverbs 19:14 - House and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the Lord.

1. Ephesians 5:22–27
Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. 

2. Genesis 2:18
Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.”

7. Ecclesiastes 4:9–10
Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!

8. Genesis 2:23–24
Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh;
she shall be called Woman,
because she was taken out of Man.”
Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

9. Isaiah 62:5
For as a young man marries a young woman,
so shall your sons marry you,
and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride,
so shall your God rejoice over you.





## El Matrimonio apunta (simboliza) el Evangelio.



Asi como la esposa se sujeta al marido (simbolizando la iglesia sujeta a su salvador) El esposo también ama a la esposa (reflejando el amor de Cristo por la iglesia). 

Esto claramente apunta a El Salvador, aquél que dió su vida por la iglesia.
