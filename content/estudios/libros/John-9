[**
Jhn 9:1** ](verseid:43.9.1) As He passed by, He saw a man blind from birth.``` this man's day started out begging like he had always done since he was little```

[**Jhn 9:2** ](verseid:43.9.2) And His disciples asked Him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?" ``` the understanding 

[**Jhn 9:3** ](verseid:43.9.3) Jesus answered, "*It was* neither *that* this man sinned, nor his parents; but *it was* so that the works of God might be displayed in him.

[**Jhn 9:4** ](verseid:43.9.4) "We must work the works of Him who sent Me as long as it is day; night is coming when no one can work.

[**Jhn 9:5** ](verseid:43.9.5) "While I am in the world, I am the Light of the world."

[**Jhn 9:6** ](verseid:43.9.6) When He had said this, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and applied the clay to his eyes,

[**Jhn 9:7** ](verseid:43.9.7) and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated, Sent). So he went away and washed, and came *back* seeing.

[**Jhn 9:8** ](verseid:43.9.8) Therefore the neighbors, and those who previously saw him as a beggar, were saying, "Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?"

[**Jhn 9:9** ](verseid:43.9.9) Others were saying, "This is he," *still* others were saying, "No, but he is like him." He kept saying, "I am the one."

[**Jhn 9:10** ](verseid:43.9.10) So they were saying to him, "How then were your eyes opened?"

[**Jhn 9:11** ](verseid:43.9.11) He answered, "The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go to Siloam and wash'; so I went away and washed, and I received sight."

[**Jhn 9:12** ](verseid:43.9.12) They said to him, "Where is He?" He *said, "I do not know."

[**Jhn 9:13** ](verseid:43.9.13) They *brought to the Pharisees the man who was formerly blind.

[**Jhn 9:14** ](verseid:43.9.14) Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.

[**Jhn 9:15** ](verseid:43.9.15) Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received his sight. And he said to them, "He applied clay to my eyes, and I washed, and I see."

[**Jhn 9:16** ](verseid:43.9.16) Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath." But others were saying, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?" And there was a division among them.

[**Jhn 9:17** ](verseid:43.9.17) So they *said to the blind man again, "What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?" And he said, "He is a prophet."

[**Jhn 9:18** ](verseid:43.9.18) The Jews then did not believe *it* of him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,

[**Jhn 9:19** ](verseid:43.9.19) and questioned them, saying, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?"

[**Jhn 9:20** ](verseid:43.9.20) His parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;

[**Jhn 9:21** ](verseid:43.9.21) but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself."

[**Jhn 9:22** ](verseid:43.9.22) His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.

[**Jhn 9:23** ](verseid:43.9.23) For this reason his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."

[**Jhn 9:24** ](verseid:43.9.24) So a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner."

[**Jhn 9:25** ](verseid:43.9.25) He then answered, "Whether He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see."

``` Do you think the blind man said...'bah i wonder why i've been blind my whole life. I wonder how that man healed me?....NO! He says, all i know is I was blind but now I see. ```

[**Jhn 9:26** ](verseid:43.9.26) So they said to him, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"

[**Jhn 9:27** ](verseid:43.9.27) He answered them, "I told you already and you did not listen; why do you want to hear *it* again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do you?"

[**Jhn 9:28** ](verseid:43.9.28) They reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.

[**Jhn 9:29** ](verseid:43.9.29) "We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, we do not know where He is from."

[**Jhn 9:30** ](verseid:43.9.30) The man answered and said to them, "Well, here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and *yet* He opened my eyes.

[**Jhn 9:31** ](verseid:43.9.31) "We know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.

[**Jhn 9:32** ](verseid:43.9.32) "Since the beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.

[**Jhn 9:33** ](verseid:43.9.33) "If this man were not from God, He could do nothing."

[**Jhn 9:34** ](verseid:43.9.34) They answered him, "You were born entirely in sins, and are you teaching us?" So they put him out.

[**Jhn 9:35** ](verseid:43.9.35) Jesus heard that they had put him out, ``` The religious leaders put him out```and finding him, ``` Jesus in turn looked for him and accepted him``` He said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"

[**Jhn 9:36** ](verseid:43.9.36) He answered, "Who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?"

[**Jhn 9:37** ](verseid:43.9.37) Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him, and He is the one who is talking with you."

[**Jhn 9:38** ](verseid:43.9.38) And he said, "Lord, I believe." And he worshiped Him.

[**Jhn 9:39** ](verseid:43.9.39) And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind."

[**Jhn 9:40** ](verseid:43.9.40) Those of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, "We are not blind too, are we?" ``` Matt 23```

[**Jhn 9:41** ](verseid:43.9.41) Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but since you say, 'We see,' your sin remains.
