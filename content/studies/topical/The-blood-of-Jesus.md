# The blood of Jesus

## Brought Freedom

[**Zec 9:9** ](verseid:38.9.9) Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout *in triumph,*O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

[**Zec 9:11** ](verseid:38.9.11) As for you also, because of the blood of *My* covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.

[**Mat 26:28** ](verseid:40.26.28) for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.

1 OH, wondrous hour when Saviour Thou,
Co-equal with the eternal God,
Beneath our sins didst deign to bow
**And shed for us Thy precious blood!**

2 On Thee, the Father's blessed Son,
As Lamb of God our judgment fell;
That all was borne, that all is done,
Thine agony, Thy cross can tell.

3 Thy cross, Thy cross! 'tis there we see
What Thou, our blessed Saviour, art;
There all the love that dwells in Thee
Was labouring in Thy breaking heart.

4 For us it was: our life we owe,
Our joy, our glory, all to Thee;
Thy sufferings in that hour of woe,
**Thy victory, Lord, have made us free.**
