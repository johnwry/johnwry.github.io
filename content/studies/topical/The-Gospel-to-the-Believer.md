# The Gospel to the Believer

Ephesians 3:8  To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles **the unfathomable riches of Christ**,



[**1Corinthians 15:2** ](verseid:46.15.2) ...you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.



[**Romans 1:16-17** ](verseid:45.1.16) For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.

[**Col 1:22-23** ](verseid:51.1.22) yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach—**if indeed you continue** in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and **not moved away from the hope of the gospel** that you have heard...
