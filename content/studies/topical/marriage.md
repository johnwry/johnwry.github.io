“BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY AND FILL THE EARTH” Here we also see a major purpose of marriage: bearing children. This means that sexual intercourse is God’s invention, and pre-dated the Fall, so is part of God’s “very good” creation. But this is so only in its proper God-ordained context—marriage, which as shown above is only between a man and a woman: Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous (Hebrews 13:4).
