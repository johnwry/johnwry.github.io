Paul on fellowship:

1. First clarification: does Paul connect “walking by the Spirit” to fellowship? Key factual observation Paul almost never uses κοινωνία to describe the believer’s ongoing moral walk. When Paul speaks of: walking (περιπατέω) according to the Spirit (κατὰ πνεῦμα) he does not grammatically connect these to maintaining or restoring κοινωνία with God. That connection is assumed, not stated.
2. Paul’s use of “walk” (περιπατέω) Romans 8:4 τοῖς μὴ κατὰ σάρκα περιπατοῦσιν ἀλλὰ κατὰ πνεῦμα Observations περιπατοῦσιν — present participle Describes characteristic manner of life No mention of fellowship No consequence of “loss” or “restoration” Paul describes who fulfills the righteous requirement, not who regains access. Galatians 5:16 πνεύματι περιπατεῖτε καὶ ἐπιθυμίαν σαρκὸς οὐ μὴ τελέσητε Observations imperative: “walk” Result clause concerns behavioral outcome, not relational status No κοινωνία language No conditional access to God stated The command governs conduct, not relationship entry.
3. Paul’s use of κοινωνία (fellowship) Paul uses κοινωνία primarily for: • participation in Christ • sharing in suffering • sharing materially • participation in the Spirit 1 Corinthians 1:9 ἐκλήθητε εἰς κοινωνίαν τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ Observations ἐκλήθητε — aorist passive (completed calling) Fellowship is something believers were called into No verbs of maintenance or repair 2 Corinthians 13:14 ἡ κοινωνία τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος Observation Fellowship is stated, not conditioned No ethical prerequisite attached
4. Does Paul ever say sin disrupts fellowship with God? This is decisive. Paul never says: fellowship is broken access is suspended relationship is interrupted Instead, he speaks differently.
5. Paul’s actual relational language: access, standing, peace Romans 5:1–2 εἰρήνην ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν θεόν προσαγωγὴν ἐσχήκαμεν Observations ἔχομεν — present indicative (we have peace) ἐσχήκαμεν — perfect (standing secured) No later warning of loss due to conduct Paul locates the relationship in completed acts, not daily performance.
6. What happens when believers walk “according to the flesh”? Paul does address this — but notice the consequences. Galatians 6:8 ὁ σπείρων εἰς τὴν σάρκα… φθοράν 1 Corinthians 3:1–3 σαρκικοί ἐστε Observations Paul rebukes believers He never says they lose fellowship with God The consequences are experiential, ethical, or communal, not relational rupture
7. Discipline ≠ loss of fellowship Even in severe cases: 1 Corinthians 5:5 παραδοῦναι τὸν τοιοῦτον τῷ σατανᾷ Observation The purpose is corrective Paul still calls them “brothers” Fellowship with God is never said to be revoked
8. Why then does Paul emphasize “walking by the Spirit”? Text-bound answer Because for Paul: • walking by the Spirit explains how life in Christ is expressed • it explains fruit vs works • it governs experience, power, and witness • it protects community health It does not regulate access to God.
9. Comparison with John (important) John Paul Abiding reveals reality Walking expresses reality Fellowship never said to break Standing never said to collapse Tests false claims Corrects misdirected lives Different emphases, same grammatical restraint. Final text-bound conclusion According to Paul’s writings: • Walking according to the Spirit is commanded to believers • It governs conduct and experience, not fellowship status • Paul never teaches that believers must walk rightly to maintain fellowship with God • Fellowship / access / standing are described as already given, not periodically re-entered Therefore: Paul does not teach “walking by the Spirit in order to have fellowship.” He teaches walking by the Spirit because fellowship already exists. Any model where fellowship is lost and regained by behavior is not grammatically stated by Paul. If you want, the next rigorous step would be: to isolate every imperative given to believers and ask whether any imperative ever threatens relational loss, or to compare Paul’s “in Christ” language with John’s “abide in me” constructions verb by verb.
