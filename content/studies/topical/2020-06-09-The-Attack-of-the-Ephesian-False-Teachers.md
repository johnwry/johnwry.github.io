> But the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons, by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron,men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth. 1 Timothy 4:1-3

I am currently teaching through the book of 1 Timothy. Paul's instructions to his disciple Timothy are of increadible value due to what is taught regarding the nature of the church. 

The church of Jesus Christ is the upholder and defender of truth. However he explains to Timothy how he should conduct himself in the household of God. The church is presented as a houshold. God's family that should be run as a functional (vs disfunctional) family. The leaders are to be well acquainted with family life as a condition for becoming leaders. 

Then in chapter 4 Paul reminds of Timothy of how the Holy Spirit had said that in later times people would come along who were used of demons to teach things contrary to the truth. It seems rather strange that their 'great heresy' was to teach against marriage and eating. This does not seem so bad in light of all we see going on around us. Especially regarding deceptive teaching that leads people astray...or wait...maybe he IS talking about deceptive things using family examples. 

## The Attack

**Marriage** is the foundation of a family. When a man and a woman get married a new family is born. Often times children are born and are incorporated into that family. 

**Eating** is key because we usually eat three times a day. That makes about 1095 times we are together as a family enjoying a meal together and enjoying eachother's company. The family aspect of the household of God was under attack. These deceivers were introducing false aspects that strayed them away from the family aspect.
