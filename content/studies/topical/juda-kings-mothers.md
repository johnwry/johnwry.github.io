# Kings of Juda and their mothers

1 Kings 14:16- 

Micah 1:13 



It is very interesting to note that the author of kings makes a point to mention every single Juda king's mother except in the case of two kings; Jehoram and Ahaz. 

Each is summed up as: "He walked in the way of the kings of Israel" (2 Kings 8:18, 16:3)



(2 kings 16:5-9, 15:19-20, 29, 17:3)
