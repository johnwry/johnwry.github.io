# Biblical Convenants

# Establishing a preliminary understanding

## In order to arrive at a proper understanding of the biblical covenants, we will take a step back and see the general usage and importance of the term "covenant". 

### Although we have many external sources (i.e. dictionaries, archaeological data, lexicons, historical records) that help us acquire a better understanding, we will not go to those **first**. 

### 2. A Scriptural principle: If the topic is to be considered important within the teaching of Scripture, the Bible will **provide** us sufficient usage and background to gain a sufficient understanding of that particular topic. 

## B.  Establishing the importance of the word Covenant

### 1. The word covenant **shows** up 281 times in the Old Testament (BERITH - Hebrew) and 33 times in the New Testament (DIATHEKE - Greek). This word appears all the way from Genesis to Revelation.

#### a. In the Old Testament (BERITH): 27 times in **Genesis**, 13 times in Exodus, 10 times in Leviticus, 5 times in Numbers, 27 times in Deuteronomy, 22 Times in Joshua, 5 times in Judges, 14 times in 1 & 2 Samuel, 26 times in 1 & 2 Kings, 30 times in 1 & 2 Chronicles, 1 time in Ezra, 4 times in Nehemiah, 3 times in Job, 21 times in Psalms, 1 time in proverbs, 12 times in Isaiah, 24 times in Jeremiah, 18 times in Ezekiel, 7 times in Daniel, 5 times in Hosea, 1 time in Amos, 1 time in Obadiah, 2 times in Zechariah and 6 times in Malachi. 

#### b. In the New Testament (DIATHEKE): 1 time in Matthew, 1 time in Mark, 2 times in Luke, 2 times in Acts, 1 time in Romans, 3 times in 1 & 2 Corinthians, 2 times in Galatians, 21 times in **Hebrews** and 1 time in Revelation. 

##### 1) Jesus is **quoted** using the term at least 5 times. 

###### a) Though these quotes are referencing the same event, it is of interest that several different writers of the NT quote him speaking of a **covenant**, it gives us a clue it must be an important topic. 

#### c. These and many observations more warrant a deeper **study** on the word covenant and its meaning.

## C.  Establishing the meaning of the word covenant

### 1.   What is the first Scriptural **mention** of the word? 

#### a.   The **first** appearance of the word is in Genesis (Gen 6:18)

##### 1)   God initiates and promises **Noah** he will establish (ratify) a “covenant” with him

##### 2)   God promises it here but it is not Ratified until **after** the flood and its fulfillment is ongoing

###### a)   ‘A new beginning’ (compare Gen 9:3 and Gen 1:29-30)

##### 3)   God’s **promises** to Noah, his descendants and to all flesh (Gen 9:9ff)

###### a)   No negotiations **took** place

###### b)  Universal

###### c)   Unconditional

###### d)  Had a sign (rainbow) to remind God of his promise to all **flesh** 

###### e)  everlasting

##### 4)   The Noahic covenant sets a **pattern** for other covenants

###### a)   God first makes a promise to someone of establishing a covenant. 

###### b)  This is conditioned upon a response of faith. 

###### c)   God then establishes the terms of the covenant and ratifies it. 

###### d)  Though the covenant goes into effect immediately, the fulfillment of the covenant may be postponed. 

### 2.   Usage of the word - we see the **term** used in a great deal of ways.

#### a.   Covenants among men

##### 1)   Abimelech and Isaac (Gen 26:26-31)

##### 2)   Joshua and the Gibeonites (Joshua 9:15)

###### a)   God had said not to make covenants with the **land** (Deut 7:2, Judg 2:2)

##### 3)   Solomon and **Hiram** (1 Kings 5:12)

##### 4)   **David** and Jonathan (1 Samuel 20:3, 1 Samuel 20:16-17)

##### 5)   Marriage (Mal 2:14)

##### 6)   Threshold covenant

###### a)   The threshold **seems** to be the separation of a dwelling from the outside world.

###### b)  It was an insult to set something on the threshold (1 Sam 5:4-5)

###### c)   God has made Jerusalem his threshold (translated cup) therefore is indignant of those trampling on her (Zech 1:9)

##### 7)   Antichrist will make a covenant with ‘the many’ (Dan 9:27, 2 Thess. 2:3-4, Matt 24:15)

###### a)   Daniel 9:27 - The tribulation **begins** with a ‘deal with the many for 7 years’ and ends in complete destruction

i) 7 years long 

ii) Firm (with many). This covenant is made by him and **broken** when he changes his mind. He shows no regard for covenant keeping. 

iii) Within 42 months, temple **service** is stopped (abomination of desolation) by him

#### b.   God makes covenants with people

##### 1)   The purpose of this **study** is mostly concerned with this aspect of these covenants. 

###### a)   God’s covenant with Adam (part 1)   - Hosea 6:7 - Possibly Adam here should be translated men, however by implication it does seem that a relationship of trust was set up originally . The word **covenant** does not appear in Genesis 1-3 but does not mean God did not set up a conditional agreement in the beginning, that is clear. (Gen 1:26-30). 

###### b)  God’s covenant with **Adam** (part 2)

i) This would refer to a covenant set up with Adam. 

###### c)   God’s covenant to **Cain** (Gen 4:15)

###### d)  God’s covenant with **Noah**, his descendants and all flesh (Gen 9:9-17)

###### e)  God’s covenant with Abram (Gen 12:1-3, 15:18-21, 17:2-21)

i) God’s covenant with **Isaac** (Gen 26:3)

ii) God’s covenant with Jacob (Gen 28:13)

###### f)   God’s covenant with Moses for **Israel** (Ex 24:3-8)

###### g)   God’s covenant with **Aaron** (Ex. 40:12-15, Num 25:12-13, Neh 13:29)

###### h)  God’s covenant with **David** to his family (2 Sam 7:11-16, Psa 89:3, Jer 33:21, 2 Chr 13:5)

###### i)   God’s new (renewed) covenant with Israel and **Judah** (Hos 2:18-23, Jer 31:31-34)

#### c.   Types of Covenants 

##### 1)   Blood covenants 

###### a)   Blood covenants were made by two **parties**. Both cut up animals and walked between them saying “*If I do not hold to the agreements of this covenant, you can do to me what we did to this animal.*” - Jer 34:18-20. 

###### b)  Although we often see **blood** associated with covenants, we must not presume all covenants in the Bible are sealed in blood. 

###### c)   Hebrews 13:20 - The covenant(s) and the blood of **Christ** cannot be ignored

i) Noah sacrificed **animals** before God made the covenant (Gen 8:20)

(a)  God walked though a cut of blood to covenant with Abraham

The Mosaic covenant was in **blood** (Ex. 24:8, Heb 9:19-20)

(b) New covenant was in blood (Matt 26:28, Mar 14:24, Luk 22:20, Heb 10:29, 12:24, 13:20)

##### 2)   Bilateral or Conditional covenants 

###### a)   covenants are usually **made** between two parties. In a bilateral covenant, each party agrees to upholding a certain set of conditions. 

##### 3)   Unilateral or Unconditional covenants

###### a)   A unilateral covenant is where one **party** guarantees carrying out both the responsibilities and results of the arrangement. 

##### 4)   Marriage covenant 

###### a)   Marriage (as instituted by God) is **unique**. Two unilateral parties (one man, one woman) enter a covenant before God in unconditional agreement with each other until death. The only possible conditions for the covenant to be dissolved is by adultery or abandonment (unbeliever). 

##### 5)   Covenant of Salt - “equivalent to an indissoluble covenant, or inviolable contract” - Keil & Delitzsch

##### 6)   Definition of the **word** covenant

###### a)   The Hebrew term BERIYTH for "covenant" is from a **root** with the sense of "cutting", because pacts or covenants were made by passing between cut pieces of flesh of the victim of an animal sacrifice. - Wikipedia

###### b)  The Greek word for covenant is DIATHEKE which **means** a disposition, arrangement, of any sort, which one wishes to be valid, the last disposition which one makes of his earthly possessions after his death, a testament or will.

#### d.   Summarizing Types of Covenants as agreements

##### 1)   International **treaties** (Joshua 9:6, 1 Kings 15:19)

##### 2)   **Clan** alliances (Gen 14:13)

##### 3)   Personal agreements (Gen 31:44)

##### 4)   Legal **contracts** (Jer 34:8-10)

##### 5)   Loyalty agreements (1 Sam 20:14-17)

##### 6)   Marriage (Mal 2:14)

##### 7)   Other **terms** used for Covenants

###### a)   Covenant as promise - although God makes promises, covenants are usually more involved than a **simple** promise. 

###### b)  Covenant as grace or redemption - **divine** covenants are sometimes soteriological in nature but not every time and not by definition. While the most important thing is God’s plan of redemption (especially to me as an individual) it is not everything God is doing. He has many things happening at once. 

###### c)   Covenant as administration or relational - this is to **see** the covenants from a theological interpretive nature

###### d)  Covenant as vassal treaty or land **grant** - the problem with this view is that God’s covenants are seen as being based on this understanding rather than the vassal treaty arrangement having an origin and beginning from God’s dealings with man. God certainly uses means to relate with man in terms he can understand but His relation is not on the basis of human understanding but rather on His the basis of His character. 

#### e.   Based on the Scriptural usage of the **word** in international treaties, clan alliances, personal agreements, legal contracts and loyalty agreements, the types of covenants, and the meaning of the original words, we define a biblical covenant as an agreement or binding alliance between two parties, establishing a relationship of trust. The nature of a covenant is explained within itself. Usually they are a solemn, unbreakable, never-ending bond. 

## D.  Building an understanding from the Biblical usage of covenants

### 1.   Care must be taken to **build** a theological understanding from the teaching of Scripture, not the other way around. This is especially true in regards to the divine covenants. 

#### a.   God’s plan of the **ages** can be understood through covenants He has made with man

##### 1)   The divine covenants do not go against any of God’s **attributes**

##### 2)   The divine covenants **reveal** the purposes and relationship between God and man, particularly in regards to His chosen nation, Israel

### 2.   Different theological systems regarding covenants

#### a.   2 Covenants/ 3 Covenants - Covenant Theology

##### 1)   Covenant of works vs covenant of **grace** + covenant of redemption 

##### 2)   Covenant of works is **before** the fall of man when God gives him duties to fulfill

##### 3)   Understands biblical covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic etc. Etc. ) within covenant of **grace**

##### 4)   Church starts at Adam -> Israel -> **today**

##### 5)   The covenant theologian indirectly admits this theology is not taught in Scripture but is necessary to ‘understand’ Scripture...

...that only (historic) Reformed theology provides the system of                doctrine necessary for an exposition of the divine covenants which is faithful to the teaching of Scripture. 
             Karlberg, “Covenant Theology” p. 11.

 

#### b.   5 Covenants (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)

#### c.   7 Covenants (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, **Land**, Mosaic, Davidic, New)

#### d.   8 Covenants (Adamic, Adamic (post fall) Noahic, Abrahamic, Land, Mosaic, Davidic, **New**)

 

# II.  God made covenants with man

## A.  A word concerning God’s covenant program

### 1.   Throughout history we **notice** how God initiates agreements with people to establish a relational dynamic. This is true before the fall, it is true after the fall when all is broken and eventually the relationship with man will be fully restored through Jesus Christ. 

### 2.   God’s covenant **program** can be traced back to the Abrahamic covenant (Gen 12:1-3) and further clarification is given in Genesis 13:14-17 and Genesis 17:1-8. This covenant was codified in Genesis 15. 

### 3.   A general order of practice can be seen the covenants God **makes** with man. First, God promises the covenant, then God ratifies the covenant and finally God fulfills the covenant. 

|                  | **Promised** | **Inaugurated/Ratified** | **Observance/Fulfillment** |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Noahic**       | Gen 6:18     | Gen 9:9                  | Gen 9:11                   |
| **Abrahamic**    | Gen 12       | Gen 15                   | Kingdom of God             |
| **Mosaic**       | Ex. 6:4      | Ex. 24:8                 | Mat 5:17                   |
| **New Covenant** | Jer 31       | Luke 22:20               | Jer 31:34 Kingdom  of God  |

####  

## B.  Adamic (Edenic) Covenant - Before the fall (Hosea 6:7, Gen 1:26-30, 2:15-25)

### 1.   God evidently made a covenant with **Adam** in the garden. Hosea 6:7

#### a.   God **made** a conditional covenant with Adam (Gen 1:18, 2:16- 17)

##### 1)   Adam was to **care** for the garden and the animals. (Gen 1:26, 28)

##### 2)   Adam was to multiply and be **fruitful**. (Gen 1:28)

##### 3)   Adam was not to take from the tree of knowledge of **good** and evil. (Gen 2:17)

#### b.   Some would say “Adam” in Hosea 6:7 refers to men in **general**?

##### 1)   God did not **make** a covenant with men in general

##### 2)   Probably not since the breaking of the covenant would **have** to refer to Adam not mankind for this verse to make sense. Israel would have to understand ‘the covenant’ that Adam would have broken. (Joel 31:33)

## C.  God’s Covenant to Noah (Gen 8:15-9:17)

## 1.   Genesis 6:18 - *"But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife, and your sons' wives with you*. This is the first use of the word covenant (BERITH) . 

## 2.   Universal - To Noah, his descendants and all flesh (Gen 9:11)

### 3.   Sign of the covenant is the **rainbow** (Gen 9:12-17)

#### a.   The idea of an outward **sign** in connection with a covenant is established

### 4.   Duration: Forever (Gen 9:16)

### 5.   Commands of the covenant

#### a.   Be **fruitful** and multiply (Gen 9:1, 7)

#### b.   No eating **blood** (Gen 9:3-4)

#### c.   Men must govern - **life** is sacred, capital punishment (Gen 9:5-6)

### 6.   The promises contained in the covenant

#### a.   God will never destroy **every** living thing (Gen 8:21-22)

#### b.   The animal kingdom will **fear** man (Gen 9:2)

#### c.   Man has right to eat **meat** (Gen 9:3)

#### d.   There will never be a world-wide flood to destroy the **earth** (Gen 9:11, 15)

### 7.   Conditions of the covenant - unconditional

######  

## D.  God’s Covenant to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3, 13:14-18, 15:1-21, 17:1-27, 1 Chr 18:3, 2 Chr 9:25-26, Acts 3:12-26, Rom 4, Gal 3:1-18)

### 1.   As we study the covenants God makes with people, we see the covenants interconnected and God has a certain plan in **mind**. He chooses individuals for the purpose of furthering that program. 

#### a.   Noah lived 950 years. In Genesis 10-11 we’re told how man quickly became corrupted after the flood. Babel (in **Shinar**) is the narrative of how mankind as one nation and language became corrupted and idolatrous. 

#### b.   Not long before Noah dies, God calls Abram out of Ur (in the land of Shinar), out his culture, his people, his former heritage and pagan life to a **place** God had for him. 

##### 1)   The promise of a land was conditioned on Abram’s **faith** in God.

#### c.   Understanding the connection between **Noah** and Abraham

##### 1)   Soon after Noah and his family get off the ark, we see that evidently sin did not get destroyed in the **flood**. (Genesis 9:18-29). It it in this account that we also see how Shem is chosen in connection to God’s blessing and Canaan (Ham’s descendant) is cursed. Noah’s blessings and curses should probably be understood as prophetic.

###### a)   Genesis 9:24 - When Noah awoke from his wine, he knew what his youngest son had done to him. When Noah woke up from his drunken stupor he deals with his **sons** who got involved. 

###### b)  Genesis 9:25 - *So he said, "Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants He shall be to his brothers."* Noah **curses** Ham’s son (and the Canaanites) for his sinful response to Noah’s drunkenness. 

###### c)   Genesis 9:26 - *He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, The God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.* God receives blessing and **glory** for Shem’s actions. Canaan would be his servant. 

###### d)  Abraham is a descendant of Shem, the **line** of blessing (Gen 11:10-26)

(ii) Moses gives this account to **Israel** after they have left Egypt as background to God’s sovereign choice of Israel as His nation. Israel was to serve as a vessel for God to show his glory and light unto the nations. They needed to understand God had given them the land of Canaan and take it by faith because God had given it to them. 

### 2.   The initial **promise** to Abram is found in Genesis 12:1-3

### a.   In a similar fashion as God did with **Noah**, God promises to establish a covenant with him in the future. Like Noah, Abraham would have to trust God and move forward knowing that following his move to a foreign land God would establish his covenant with him. 

#### b.   Genesis 12:1 - *Now the LORD said to Abram, "Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you;* Abram needed to **leave** his home and go to a land where God wanted for this promise to be enacted. This reminds us of Noah who had to build and ark and trust God through the flood before God made a covenant with him. Once the covenant was made it was not conditioned in any way on Abraham’s part. 

### c.   Genesis 12:2 - *And I will make you a great nation*. Abraham would be made by God into a great **nation.**  

### d.   Genesis 12:2b - *And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing*. He would be **blessed** by God and become a blessing to others. God’s blessings are so we can bless others. 

### e.   Genesis 12:3a - *And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse*. Blessings and curses would come to **nations** that either blessed or cursed Israel. 

#### f.   Genesis 12:3b *And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed*. All the families or ethnic peoples of the **earth** would be blessed in him. 

### 3.   The covenant contains 9 promises and can be summed up into 3. 

#### a.   The **land** (Gen 15:18-21)

#### b.   The **seed** (Gen 22:17)

#### c.   The **blessing** (Gen 22:17-18)

### 4.   General features of the Abrahamic covenant

#### a.   **Eternal** (Gen 13:15, 17:7-8, 13, 19)

#### b.   Unconditional (Gen 15:9-12, 17-18) God swore by himself (Heb 6:13)

#### c.   **Future** fulfillment

#### 5.   Literal historical fulfillment 

##### 1)   Abraham was **blessed** 

###### a)   **Land** (Gen 13:8, 14:22-23)

###### b)  Servants (Gen 15:7)

###### c)   **Cattle** (Gen 13:2, 24:34-35)

##### 2)   Abraham had **many** offspring (Josh 24:3)

##### 3)   Abraham became a **great** name (2Chr 20:7, Luk 1:73, Luk 13:28, Rom 4:3)

##### 4)   Abraham has become a channel of blessing to **all** people groups (Gal 3:7-9)

##### 5)   Historically **nations** have been blessed or cursed in direct relation to Israel 

###### a)   Edomites cursed for cursing Israel (Oba 1:2, 10, 12)

(iii)                          Future destruction promised (Obadiah 1:15)

###### b)  Abimelech **blessed** for blessing Israel (Gen 20:2-18)

###### c)   Others (Deut 30:7, Isa 14:1-2, Joe 3:1-8, Matt 25:40-45)

##### 6)   Abraham had an **heir** by Sarah (Gen 21:2)

### 6.   Literal Future Fulfillment

#### a.   Israel’s sin and lack of keeping the Mosaic covenant did not **annul** the unconditional promises God made to Abraham’s descendants. (Gal 3:17)

#### b.   Though many initial things were seen, the covenant was not fulfilled during Abraham’s life. He was looking **ahead** for its fulfillment (Heb 11:8-12, Jn 8:56). 

#### c.   It was not fulfilled before Jesus’ **death** (Matt 26:29, Luk 22:16, 18, 29-30)

#### d.   Seed aspect: David’s **throne** (over Israel from Jerusalem) is currently exercising authority. Jesus Christ will be seated on the throne of David as king over Israel and the nations. 

##### 1)   Luke 22:69 *"But from now on THE SON OF MAN WILL BE SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND of the power OF GOD."* Jesus is currently seated at the **right** hand of the Father’s throne.

###### a)   *The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."* Jesus was not seated at God’s right hand until after his ascension. (Heb 10:12) He will be seated there for a temporary **period** of time not eternally as was promised to David. (2 Sam 7:14, Heb 1:8)

##### 2)   Revelation 3:21 - *'He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.* Jesus is currently seated at his Father’s throne. One day he will be seated on his **throne**. 

##### 3)   Isaiah 9:6 - *For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.* This is a reference of Jesus. A child is born is regarding his humanity. A son will be **given** has to do with his divinity. The government (rule of heaven and earth) will be upon his shoulders. 

##### 4)   Isaiah 9:7a - *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom...*Jesus will reign on David’s **throne** (as descendent of David) and the **duration** of it will be forever. 

#### e.   The fullness of the gentiles has obviously not **come** in today. Gentiles are still getting saved. Therefore, God’s program will shift to work with Israel once again in the future (Rom 11:25).

#### f.   The land boundary markers have not **been** fulfilled (Gen 15:18-21). The land was not given to Abraham but rather to his descendants.

### 7.   The Abrahamic covenant is **further** developed throughout the Old Testament 

#### a.   To **Isaac** (Gen 17:19, Gen 26:2-4) 

#### b.   To **Jacob** (Gen 28:13-15)

#### c.   **Land** covenant (Deut. 30:1-10)

#### d.   **Davidic** covenant (Seed) (2 Sam. 7:14-16) 

#### e.   **New** covenant (Blessing) (Jer. 31:31-34)

### 8.   Outward **sign** of the covenant (Gen 17:9-14)

#### a.   Many covenants had an outward, earthly **sign**. The sign of the Abrahamic covenant was circumcision

## E.  Mosaic Covenant - God’s bilateral agreement with Israel (Ex 19-24, Deut 28:1-16, )

### 1.   God promises Moses to rescue Israel from oppression and give them a land flowing with milk and **honey** (the land of the Canaanites) at the burning bush incident (Ex 3:17)

### 2.   This covenant is between God and Israel, established at Mount **Sinai** (Ex 19:3-8)

#### a.   Exodus 19:3a - *Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain*, God’s instruction to Moses was to bring Israel to this **point** and get further instructions. (Ex 3:12) 

#### b.   Exodus 19:3b - *saying, "Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the sons of Israel:* This covenant is a **bilateral** agreement between Israel and God mediated through Moses. 

#### c.   Exodus 19:4 - *'You yourselves have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to Myself.* By **grace** Israel had been brought out. God demonstrated his promise to Israel by rescuing her from Egypt. (Rom 9:15-17)

#### d.   Exodus 19:5a - *'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant.*..the conditional aspect of this covenant is set forth from the beginning. The condition was if Israel fully obeyed God’s **voice** and kept his covenant. 

#### e.   Exodus 19:5b - *then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine;* As Israel kept this covenant it would become evident *among all the peoples* that they were in fact his possession. God had already said they were brought out to himself. They were already chosen. This was an unconditional promise made to Abraham centuries before. Therefore, we conclude this was not about becoming God’s possession but rather **walking** before men reflecting who they already were. 

#### f.   Exodus 19:6a - *and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.* Becoming a kingdom of priests and a holy nation was conditional upon keeping the Law. Under this theocratic kingdom, Israel would be a holy **nation** with priests. This refers to a literal, earthly fulfillment as stated by Moses in his last words in Deuteronomy 33:29 , “*Blessed are you, O Israel; Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, Who is the shield of your help And the sword of your majesty! So your enemies will cringe before you, And you will tread upon their high places.*” (Num 24:8, 17, Dan 7:27)

#### g.   Exodus 19:6b-7 - *These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel. So Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the LORD had commanded him.* Moses was the mediator between God and the people. *And Moses brought back the **words** of the people to the LORD.* (Ex 19:8b) 

#### h.   Exodus 19:8 - *All the people answered together and said, "All that the LORD has spoken we will do!"*. Israel was just miraculously delivered from slavery under the most powerful **ruler** on earth. They are excited to be free and will accept to do anything God asks. Little do they know, the Law is much too demanding and high a standard to be kept all of the time. 

#### i.   Exodus 20 - The Ten Commandments - the **basic** terms of the Mosaic Covenant 

##### 1)   The four first commands had to do with God their sovereign

###### a)   To **honor** the one true God 

###### b)  Jesus sums **these** commands as *'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.’* Matthew 22:37 

##### 2)   Six commands had to do with **man**

###### a)   Respecting **fellow** man

###### b)  Jesus sums up **these** commands as, *'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'* Matthew 22:39

##### 3)   It established a **nation** with its own constitution

###### a)   Established **national** independence

###### b)  Established **moral** code

###### c)   Established relationships between Israel and God as sovereign and man as equal-rights bearers. 

(i)   Written with **finger** of God (Deut 4:13, Ex 31:18, 32:16)

(ii)  All 12 **tribes** of Israel accepted the terms

##### 4)   Given to establish Israel’s national identity

##### 5)   Given to keep in custody **until** Christ came (Gal 3:19, 23)

##### 6)   Established God’s righteous standard to make **known** to humankind 

##### 7)   It was **given** for convicting of knowledge of sin (Rom 3:19, 5:20, Rom 7:7)

###### a)   To **lead** to Christ

### 3.   The Mosaic Covenant was ratified in **blood** (Ex 24:1-8)

### 4.   Was given on a temporary **basis** (‘forever’ with conditions) (Deut 12:28)

#### a.   God knew they would not **keep** it (Eze 20:25, Rom 7:10)

#### b.   Though they promised they would to everything God said, they failed miserably (Deut 5:27-28, Jer 11:10). They were **bound** to fail since it was conditioned on man’s faithfulness and not God’s. 

### 5.   This covenant was a **bilateral** agreement (Deut 5:28-29)

#### a.   Conditioned **upon** Israel’s obedience  

##### 1)   **Rewarded** for keeping it - (Deut 11:26-28)

##### 2)   Punished for **disobeying** - (Deut 11:26-28)

### 6.   Sign of the covenant is the Sabbath **day** (Ex. 31:12-18)

#### a.   A national day of **rest** reflected God as their creator

#### b.   Each individual **person** was to set aside the 7th day and remember God

### 7.   The Mosaic covenant was **never** given to justify anyone (Gal 3:11)

### 8.   Given 430 **years** after the Abrahamic Covenant (Gal 3:16-18)

#### a.   Did not **annul** or add conditions to the Abraham covenant

## F.  ‘Land’ Covenant - (Deuteronomy 29-30, Ezekiel 16, 47:1-48:35) 

### 1.   Sometimes this covenant is incorrectly referred to as the Palestinian covenant. Not only is this term not used in the Bible, this term was coined by a **Roman** emperor named Hadrian who prohibited Jews from entering Israel again and tried to wipe out the memory of Israel by calling the land after their enemies, the Philistines.

#### a.   The Lord called it the land of **Israel**. (Matt 2:20, Gen 9:25-27) 

#### b.   Old Testament calls it the promised **land** (Gen 28:15, 50:24, Ex 12:25, Num 14:16, Deut 6:3, 9:28, 19:8, 27:3, Josh 23:5)

##### 1)   Land flowing with **milk** and honey (Deut 6:3)

### 2.   Genesis 15:18-21 - *On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your descendants I have given this land, From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates: the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite."* The size of this land given to **Abram** is clearly stated. (Eze 47:15-20)

### 3.   Deuteronomy 29:1 - *These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb.*..though Moses is involved in the making of this covenant, and it is also between God and Israel, **clearly** this covenant is not connected to the Mosaic Covenant (Deut 29:13).

### 4.   Deuteronomy 30:20 - *...for this is your life and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them*. This covenant is an **expansion** of the Abrahamic. 

### 5.   There are 8 promises in this covenant. The land will eventually be given to Israel, yet the timing of fulfillment based on Israel’s spiritual **return** to the Lord (Deut 30:1-8)

#### a.   Deuteronomy 30:1 - *"So it shall be when all of these things have come upon you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all nations where the LORD your God has banished you,* **First**: Israel will disobey the Mosaic Covenant and be spread out around the world (Deut 29:2-30:1, Eze 16:35-52). 

#### b.   Deuteronomy 30:2 - *and you return to the LORD your God and obey Him with all your heart and soul according to all that I command you today, you and your sons,* **Second**: Israel will repent.

#### c.   Deuteronomy 30:3 - *then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity, and have compassion on you,* **Third**: The Messiah will come.

#### d.   Deuteronomy 30:3b-4 - *and will gather you again from all the peoples where the LORD your God has scattered you."If your outcasts are at the ends of the earth, from there the LORD your God will gather you, and from there He will bring you back.* **Fourth**: Israel will be regathered.

##### 1)   Since the scattering is literal (70AD), we must understand the regathering to also be **literal**.

#### e.   Deuteronomy 30:5 - *The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and He will prosper you and multiply you more than your fathers.* **Fifth**: Israel will possess the Promised Land (Eze 47:22).

#### f.   Deuteronomy 30:6 - *Moreover the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul, so that you may live.* **Sixth**: Israel will be regenerated.

#### g.   Deuteronomy 30:7 - *The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.* **Seventh**: the enemies of Israel will be judged.

#### h.   Deuteronomy 30:8 - *And you shall again obey the LORD, and observe all His commandments which I command you today*. **Eighth**: Israel will receive full blessing; specifically, the blessings of the Messianic Age. (Deut 30:8-20)

### 6.   The importance of this covenant is that it affirms Israel’s title deed to the land

#### a.   There are no ‘ifs’. It is unconditional **based** on the covenant made to Abraham.

##### 1)   Since it is unconditional it is still in **effect** today

######  

## G.  God’s covenant to David and his House (2 Chr 7:18, 13:5, 21:7, 2 Sam 7:14, Jer 33:14-26, Psa 89:28-29, 33-34, 110:1, 132:11-18)

### 1.   The Davidic Covenant is an expansion to the **seed** (*a great nation*) aspect of the Abrahamic covenant.

### 2.   2 Samuel 7:12-16 - About **four** hundred years after the covenant is given, David wanted to build God a house. In return however, God says he will allow David’s son to build him a temple and make David’s house and his throne last forever. (1 Chr 38:3, 5)

#### a.   2 Samuel 7:12 - *"When your days are complete and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your descendant after you, who will come forth from you, and I will establish his kingdom*. God promises to **raise** up a descendant (singular) from David’s blood line and establish his kingdom. (Psa 132:11)

##### 1)   Usually Bible prophecy contains a **near** and a far fulfillment

###### a)   1 Kings 1 narrates God working behind the scenes to secure the **throne** for Solomon, David’s son.

###### (i)     The fulfillment of this near prophecy means **God** will fulfill the far prophecy.

###### (ii)    Since Solomon literally sat on the literal **throne** of his father David, then it stands to reason the far prophecy must be literally fulfilled as well. Jesus Christ will sit on a literal, earthly throne from the city of Jerusalem. (Dan 7:13-14)

###### (iii)    Some interpret David’s throne to be spiritual. However many verses refute this idea. The arguments given against the literal fulfillment are very often very simplistic and don’t cover the vast amount of passages covering the literal fulfillment of David’s throne. Here are **some** reasons why we cannot spiritualize this kingdom. 

(a)  Daniel’s interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s dream disagrees with a spiritual fulfillment. (Dan 2:2:44-45) 

(i) This 5th kingdom destroys the first 4 earthly kingdoms. Those who say Jesus is reigning on David’s **throne** right now, must also accept that the kingdoms of man were destroyed, yet clearly that is not the case. (Isa 9:7)

(b) The throne mentioned in heaven is God’s, not **David’s** (Heb. 1:13; 8:1; 12:2; 1 Pet. 3:22, Dan 7:9,13, Mat 5:34, Mat 23:32, Rev 3:21, 5:7, 7:15, 12:5).

(i) Psalm 132:13-17 *For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation...There I will cause the horn of David to spring forth; I have prepared a lamp for Mine anointed.*

(ii) At present, Jesus as high **priest** is interceding between the church and the throne of God and not fulfilling the Davidic covenant. (Rom 8:34; 1 Tim 2:5, Heb 4:16)

(iii) God’s throne was set up in eternity **past**. David’s was not. (Psa 93:2) 

(c)  David’s throne is directly connected with the nation of Israel (Jer 33:17, 21, Mat 19:28, Isa 2:1-4, Isa 24:23, Jer 23:5-6, Mic 4:1-5)

(i) It would give them **rest** from their enemies (2 Sam 7:10-11)

(ii) They would be regenerated (Jer 31:33)

(iii) Jerusalem will be the center of the **world** (Zech 8:3)

(d) Factors indicating the distinction between God’s throne and David’s **throne**:

(i) Several descendants of David have sat on his throne, but only one descendant ever **sits** at the right hand of God’s throne in Heaven. (Psa 110:1; Heb 8:1; 12:2)

(ii) David’s throne was not established before his lifetime but God’s throne **exists** eternally. (2 Sam 7:16-17, Psa 93:1-2)


#### b.   2 Samuel 7:13 - *"He shall build a house for My name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever...* This is in regarding Solomon building a **house** for God. (1 Chr 17:11-12) The throne aspect is what is **forever**, not Solomon. Solomon will actually be cut off from the Messianic line (Jer 22:30; 36:30). 

#### c.   2 Samuel 7:14 - *"I will be a father to him and he will be a son to Me; when he commits iniquity, I will correct him with the rod of men and the strokes of the sons of men,* this is in reference to the **long** term aspect of the prophecy. 

##### 1)   Near fulfillment: Solomon committed iniquity (similar to Saul) yet God did not withdraw his promise **made** to David. 

##### 2)   Far fulfillment: Jesus did not commit iniquity, however he did identify and take on the sins of mankind, therefore God punished him using the rod and **strokes** of men. Christ did this in order to make the necessary payment for our sins. (Isa 53:6-10)

#### d.   2 Samuel 7:15 - *but My lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.* Though Solomon failed similarly to Saul, **Christ** would not have God’s lovingkindness removed from him. (Isa 53:11-12, 2 Tim 2:8, Rev 5:5)

#### e.   2 Samuel 7:16 - *"Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever."* The term “house” refers to a dynasty – a family line of kings. God’s promise to David and his descendants is that his kingdom and royal family would always be on the throne. Just as David’s throne is literal, David’s houses’ throne will also be literal with the literal people of David, the **Jews**. (Psa 132:13-14, 2 Sam 22:51)

#### f.    Genesis 3:15 - *And I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your seed and her seed; He shall bruise you on the head, And you shall bruise him on the heel."* This was the original mention of the promised **seed**.

### 3.   The fulfillment of the Davidic throne in the greater son of **David** – the Lord Jesus Christ

#### a.   Matthew and Luke establish the genealogy of Jesus. They identify **Jesus** as the son of David. (Mat 1:1-17, Luk 3:23-31)

​                        i.   Both legally and biologically, Jesus is related to **David**.

#### b.   The virgin Mary was told of her son who would be **heir** to the throne of David. (Luk 1:31-33) 

##### 1)   Luke 1:31  *"And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus*.  She would **bear** a son and she would call him Jesus. (Gen 3:15)

#### c.   **Blind** men knew Jesus was the Son of David. (Mat 9:27)

#### d.   Luke 1:32 "*He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;* Gabriel’s announcement verifies Mary’s Son will be the fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant. Jesus, son of the most high, was also a descendant of David. God would give him David’s throne. God has not given him this throne yet. David’s Son must return to earth to **rule** on David’s throne. (Psa 110:1, Rev 3:21, Isa 9:6-7, Zech 14:9, Matt 22:42-44, Mat 25:31)

##### 1)   David’s throne was earthly, political, and limited to Israel and not spiritual 

#### e.   Luke 1:33 *and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and His kingdom will have no end.*" Mary’s son would reign over Israel (the house of Jacob) his term as **king** would never end, his kingdom would be eternal. 

##### 1)   Christ has the key of David (Rev 3:7)

#### f.   Revelation 22:3 - *There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His bond-servants will serve Him;* The new heavens and new earth once God has restored all **things** has Christ reigning forever and ever (Rev 22:5)

#### g.   Revelation 22:16 - "*I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.*" The **root** – He existed before David, speaks to the eternality of Christ.

##### 1)   The offspring – He was born a descendant of David fulfilling the promise of an eternal **king** in the line of David.

#### h.   Since the Davidic covenant is an expansion to the **seed** aspect of the Abrahamic covenant, it is unconditional in its fulfillment and will be in the millennial reign. (Rev 20:4, 22:16)

#### i.   Understanding the Davidic Covenant means we know world **peace** will not come through social and political activity of the church.

##### 1)   As long as Israel remains in disobedience, Jesus Christ will not return to rule on the Davidic **throne**.

##### 2)   Presently, Jesus is seated at the **right** of the Father’s throne, not on David’s throne.

### 4.   We live in anticipation of a future literal **reign** of Jesus Christ on the earth.

#### a.   Christ’s return to establish His reign will **usher** in the Millennial Kingdom (Rev 19-20).

#### b.   Christ’s **rule** will be from Jerusalem. (Jer 3:17; Zec 14:16)

#### c.   Christ’s **rule** will extend over Israel. (Eze 37:21-28)

#### d.   Christ’s rule will extend beyond Israel to all the nations of the **earth**. (Psa 2:8; 72:8; Isa 49:6; Zec 9:10)

### 5.   World peace will not come through the **social** and political activity of secular humanism.

#### a.   Isaiah 2:4 – *And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.* The audacity of the UN to put the **quote** on their building indicates their contempt for the Davidic Covenant and God’s plan.

#### b.   They have removed the Prince of **Peace** from the formula by placing themselves in His position.

##### 1)   Permanent peace through humanism is impossible as it is set against the Creator – it is the thought system of the god of the **world** and not the God of creation.

##### 2)   The world will preach “peace at any cost” but they are lying – the **cost** is humility to submit before the Creator and they will not do it. (1 Thes 5:3)

##### 3)   Isaiah 9:6-7 – *For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore.* The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. Lasting **peace** will only come when the Prince of Peace personally rules the earth on the throne of David.

##### 4)   Until then, do not be found supporting the enemy’s fabricated plan of false **peace**.

## H.  God’s New Covenant (Jer 31:31-34, Eze 36:22-38, 37:25-28, Heb 7, 8:6-13, 12, 13)

### 1.   Contrary to popular belief, the Old Covenant is not the Old Testament and the New Testament is not the New Covenant. In fact, the New Covenant is first introduced, **promised** and explained in the Old Testament. 

### 2.   The New Covenant is an amplification to the blessing **aspect** of the Abrahamic covenant.  Gen 12:1-3

#### a.   Ezekiel 37:25 *"They will live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant, in which your fathers lived; and they will live on it, they, and their sons and their sons' sons, forever; and David My servant will be their prince forever*. This verse ties the Abrahamic covenant, the **land** (*Jacob my servant*) and a kingdom (*David my servant*) and people forever (*their sons and their sons’ sons forever*).

#### b.   Ezekiel 37:26  *"I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever*. Here a future covenant is announced. The nature of this covenant of **peace** is unconditional (Ezekiel 36:21-23).

#### c.   Ezekiel 37:27 *"My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people*. God’s dwelling place refers to Israel walking with God. Here it is announced they will reflect God’s character to the **nations**.

#### d.   Ezekiel 37:28 *"And the nations will know that I am the LORD who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.*" This is an everlasting covenant (Isa 55:3, Isa 61:8-9, Jer 32:40, 50:5) and will serve for all to **know** that the Lord is the one who sanctifies Israel. 

#### e.   Ezekiel 16:59 *For thus says the Lord GOD, "I will also do with you as you have done, you who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.* The only covenant Israel could have **broken** was the Mosaic covenant. Blessing under this covenant was conditioned upon their obedience. 

#### f.   Ezekiel 16:60 *"Nevertheless, I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you*. The covenant made in the days of her **youth** is in reference to the childhood of Israel, specifically going back to the Abrahamic covenant. 

### 3.   Jeremiah 31:31-34 tells of the New Covenant that God would establish with **Israel**. 

###### 1)   *Jeremiah 31:31 "Behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.* This is the first time a new covenant is mentioned in the Bible. The time of establishment of the covenant is not stated but who it will be with is **clear** that it is to Israel and to the house of Judah. Ratification of it would be future (compare Gen 6:18 with Gen 9:9). This will be a covenant with Israel and with the house of Judah. 

###### 2)   Jeremiah 31:32 *not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them," declares the LORD*. This covenant will be different in **nature** to the Mosaic covenant which was made between God and Israel in the land of Egypt. 

###### a)   Mosaic Covenant - the implication is that if the old covenant was made to Israel, then the new covenant is in **contrast** to the Mosaic covenant. (Heb 8:13) 

##### 3)   Jeremiah 31:33 *"But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days," declares the LORD, "I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.* This refers to the spiritual renewal Israel will undergo when they change their **minds** and believe in Jesus as Messiah. God’s law internalized. Jer 32:40

##### 4)   Jeremiah 31:34 *"They will not teach again, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them," declares the LORD, "for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more*." Israel was always having to teach because they often forgot and were **cursed** as a result. A day will come when this will no longer be needed in Israel, all will know the Lord.  Joel 2:28-32

###### a)   The restored people is **literal**

###### (i)      Will live on the **hills** of Samaria (Jer 31:5-6) 

###### (ii)    Israel and Judah will **dwell** together (Jer 31:24) 

#### b.   Ezekiel 36 also mentions some of the provisions of the New Covenant

##### 1)   **Physical** return (Eze 36:22, 24, 28)

##### 2)   **Spiritual** return (Eze 36:25-26)

##### 3)   Cleansing of **sin** (Eze 36:25, 29, 33)

##### 4)   Indwelling of the **Spirit** (Eze 36:27)

##### 5)   Fertility in the **land** (Eze 36:29-30, 24-25)

##### 6)   National **repentance** (Eze 36:31-32)

##### 7)   Physical **fertility** (Eze 36:37-38)

##### 8)   **Sole** devotion to God (Eze 36:33, Eze 34:25, 37:26)

##### 9)   Perpetual, **national** existence (v. 35-37, Isa 24:5, 61:8-9, Jer 23:40, 50:5, Eze 16:60, 27:26)

##### 10)  Jerusalem is permanently **rebuilt** (v. 38-40)

#### c.   Timing of the New Covenant

##### 1)   These provisions have never been fulfilled in Israel’s **past** and certainly not today, their fulfillment awaits a future kingdom age. 

##### 2)   When it would be **ratified** is mentioned (making or cutting a covenant) but timing is ambiguous from the Old Testament (Isa 55:3, 61:8, Jer 31:31, 32:40, Eze 34:25, 37:26)

##### 3)   Fulfillment of the New Covenant **will** be *In that day* (Isa 42:6, 49:8, 59:21, Hos 2:18-20)

## I.   The New Covenant in relation to the Church

### 1.   It is possible that you may disagree with our conclusions regarding this next section of the study. We would ask you however to prayerfully consider it as a good **Berean** and see if it agrees or not with the Scriptures. Acts 17:11

### 2.   The Covenants (including the new covenant) were given to Israel (Rom 9:4) so in order to have a better grasp, we must define who **true** Israel is. Heb 8:10

#### a.   Many Bible teachers today would have us believe that all of the promises in the bible are for every believer. This is a mistaken conclusion and sadly lacking of truth. While God **never** changes, while his character is always intact and his promises are trustworthy, his interaction with man as it pertains to his administration has undergone change and we can also see in unfulfilled prophecy that changes are yet to come. 

#### b.   Romans 9:6 *And those who will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.* As Paul concludes his letter to the Galatians, he **speaks** of *them* (Gentile believers) and upon *the Israel of God* (Jewish believers). Rom 11:1-2, Rom 11:25-26

##### 1)   To be a true Israelite one must not only be ethnically Jewish but also a believer. Jesus was saying Nathanael was a believing Jew in John 1:47 when he first **spoke** to him, “…*Lo,* **truly an Israelite***, in whom guile is not.*" YLT

#### c.   Romans 11:26-27 *and so **all Israel will be saved**; just as it is written, "THE DELIVERER WILL COME FROM ZION, HE WILL REMOVE UNGODLINESS FROM JACOB.* *THIS IS MY COVENANT WITH THEM, WHEN I TAKE AWAY THEIR SINS."* Removal of sins has only ever been possible through faith in Christ not by being born an Israelite. To be a true Israelite, one must be born a **Jew** and also believe.  

##### 1)   All Israel can in no way be seen as being saved today. The covenant God has with them however says all of Israel will be **saved**. 

### 3.   Though the parties of the New Covenant are Israel and God, the **church** has been spiritually incorporated to take part of this blessing. How?

#### a.   First, let’s take a look at what this does **not** mean

##### 1)   The church did not replace God’s program with **Israel** 

###### a)   Israel is geo-political, national and **ethnic** in nature, the church is not. 

###### b)  True **Israel** is not the church but rather believing Israel 

##### 2)   The New covenant is not being fulfilled **today**

##### 3)   The **church** involvement is not discussed in the Old Testament

##### 4)   The church is not **under** a covenant

#### b.   God had said to Abraham all the families of the earth would be blessed through him. Gentiles have become blessed through their inclusion by **faith** in Jesus Christ.

### 4.   Jesus Christ is the reason why the **church** partakes of the New Covenant blessings

#### a.   He is the mediator of the **New** Covenant. Heb 8:6

#### b.   Hebrews 10:9 *then He said, "BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL." He takes away the first in order to establish the second.*

##### 1)   Taking away the “**first**” means to take away **ritual** sacrifices of the Mosaic covenant. Jesus Christ fulfilled this conditional covenant given to Israel. Mat 5:17

##### 2)   Establishing the ”**second**” means to replace ritual sacrifices with the righteous life of Jesus who was crucified in man’s place as a **true** substitute sacrifice for sin (1 John 2:1-2).

#### c.   Hebrews 10:10 *By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.* We here refers to the **church**. Heb 10:15

#### d.   Hebrews 10:11 *Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;* Under the Mosaic covenant, the priestly **duty** was never finished. It was merely a demonstration of what was needed to make purification for sins. 

#### e.   Hebrews 10:12 *but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD…*Christ however, by becoming a substitutionary sacrifice, offering himself on our behalf, was sufficient for all time and is now **seated**. 

#### f.   Hebrews 10:13 *waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.* Sitting on His throne, Jesus is now **waiting** for his enemies to be made a **footstool** for His feet when the New Covenant Kingdom of God comes to the earth.

##### 1)   While Jesus is making **intercession** for the saints, He is also **waiting** for God the Father to **subjugate** all His enemies.

##### 2)   The enemies of Christ will be **subdued** at the **Second Advent** when Jesus comes back to save His people Israel from its Gentile enemies and set up the promised Messianic Kingdom prophesied throughout the Old Testament (Psalm 110:1-7; 2:1-12; Jeremiah 30:1-11; 31:1-6, 27-40; Zechariah 12:10; 14:2-5; Revelation 19:11-20:6; Hebrews 1:14; 2:5-8; 4:9; 12:22-29; 1 Corinthians 15:20-28).

##### 3)   While Jesus **waits** for the **fulfillment** of Israel’s prophetic covenants, the special dispensation of the church age has been revealed in the meantime through the New Testament mystery truths to confer salvation and great heavenly blessings upon Christians so they might be a witness to the enemies of Christ (Ephesians 2:14-3:11; Colossians 1:25-29; 2 Corinthians 5:14-21).

##### 4)   While Jesus **waits** to take control of His enemies, **today** is a day of grace for both believers and unbelievers to take advantage of (Hebrews 3:7-15; 10:25; 2 Corinthians 6:1-2; Romans 2:4; 11:22). 

#### g.   Hebrews 10:14 *For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.* Jesus has **perfected** forever those who are being **sanctified** (being saved), i.e., the **saints**, through His one-time sacrificial offering on the cross (Hebrews 10:10, 12; 7:25-28).

##### 1)   The complete and efficacious **onceness** of the sacrificial **offering** of Jesus Christ, in contrast to Old Testament offerings, is strongly emphasized even further (Romans 6:10; 1 Peter 3:18).

###### a)   The **cross** is, therefore, not only **necessary**, but also **sufficient** for salvation as nothing else be dare added (John 19:30; Colossians 2:8-15).

###### b)  Did Jesus Christ do **enough** on the **cross** to save you from you sins? Hebrews 10:14 resoundingly says affirmative (John 6:35-40, 48-58)!

#### h.   Hebrews 10:15 *And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,* now, through the Holy Spirit, the **church** is also made partakers of the new covenant blessings. 

#### i.   Hebrews 10:16 *"THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,"* He then says…them. This goes back to **Israel** and to the original promise made in Jeremiah 31:31-34. 

#### j.   Hebrews 10:17 "AND THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE." Because of the new covenant, Israel’s sins will be **forgiven**. 

#### k.   Hebrews 10:18  *Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin.* The blood of the New Covenant is for the forgiveness of sins. Forgiveness of sins was a promise **made** to Israel in connection to the new covenant (Jer 31:34, Matt 26:17-35, Lev 17:11). 

##### 1)   Now, because Christ’s blood ratified the covenant and because his blood was also shed for sin of the whole world, the church (Jews and Gentiles) have become partakers of the blessings without annulling or affecting in any way the inauguration and fulfillment of the new covenant to Israel as a **nation**.

#### l.   Christ’s blood is the means by which the New Covenant is ratified. Jesus instituted the Lord’s supper for the church which commemorates this covenant. Each time the church celebrates the Lord’s table, it commemorates the New covenant ‘cutting ceremony’ in the shedding of Christ’s blood. (Heb 9:26) The new covenant is completely by God’s **grace**, totally undeserved by Israel. 

##### 1)   Christ’s blood ratified the New Covenant just like **blood** ratified the Mosaic (Ex 24:8, Luk 22:20)

###### a)   Previous covenants were announced then ratified

###### (i)     Noahic (Gen 6:18 - Gen 9:9)

###### (ii)    Abrahamic (Gen 12:1-3 - Gen 15)

###### (iii)    Mosaic (Exo 3:8 – Exo 24:8)

###### (iv)    New Covenant (Jer 31:31 – the cross)

##### 2)   1 Corinthians 11:25 - *In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."* Paul teaches the Corinthian church of the significance of the cup in the breaking of bread. The cup was a **symbol** of the blood Christ shed to ratify the new covenant. 

### 5.   The church is the body and possession of Jesus Christ, therefore it has become partaker of the New Covenant blessings through the promised **Holy** Spirit. 

##### 1)   Mention is made that blessing would **flow** to the Gentiles upon ratification (Isa 55:5, Eze 36:36, 37:28)

##### 2)   The **church** was a mystery in the Old Testament era (Eph 3:1-13), therefore we should not be surprised that the church is not mentioned in connection with the new covenant. The Old Testament simply contained no information regarding the church of Jesus Christ. 

##### 3)   What are some of the blessings the **church** partakes of the new covenant?

###### a)   The church has been made **servants** of the new covenant. 2 Cor 3:6 says, “*who also made us adequate as **servants of a new covenant**, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.*”

(i)     Christ became a servant to confirm to Israel the promises that God made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, specifically the new covenant. Rom 15:8-13

###### b)  The forgiveness of **sins**

###### c)   The Holy Spirit 

###### (i)     He **sanctifies** us, 

###### (ii)    He **instructs** us, 

###### (iii)   He **empowers** us for service, 

###### (iv)   He seals us until the **day** of redemption

|                  | Jesus  as King            | Jesus  as head/leader               |

### 6.   The new covenant has not been inaugurated yet since it’s fulfillment is set for the coming kingdom, yet the church is already partaking to a certain degree of some of its spiritual blessings. God has already equipped the church with the Holy Spirit and is preparing the church as future **servants** of the new covenant to serve in the age to come when she will reign and rule with Christ when all of the new covenant blessings are fulfilled in the Messianic Kingdom.
