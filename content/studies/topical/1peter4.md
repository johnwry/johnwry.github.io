Title: 1 Peter 4:1-6
---



[**1Pe 4:1** ](verseid:60.4.1) Therefore, Christ having suffered for us in *the* flesh, also you arm yourselves *with* the same thought, because he having suffered in *the* flesh has been made to rest from sin,

[**1Pe 4:2** ](verseid:60.4.2) for *him* no longer to live in *the* lusts of men, but *to live* the remaining time in *the* flesh in *the* will of God.

[**1Pe 4:3** ](verseid:60.4.3) For *the* time of life having passed is sufficient for us to have worked out the will of the nations, having gone on in wantonness, lusts, drunkenness, parties, carousings, and lawless idolatries;

[**1Pe 4:4** ](verseid:60.4.4) in which they are surprised, you not running with *them* into the same overflow of unsavedness, blaspheming;

[**1Pe 4:5** ](verseid:60.4.5) who will give account to Him having readiness to judge *the*living and dead.

[**1Pe 4:6** ](verseid:60.4.6) For to this *end* also the gospel was preached to *the* dead, that they might be judged according to men in *the* flesh, but might live according to God in *the* Spirit.

Therefore, Christ 
	having suffered 
		for us 
			in flesh, 
					also you 
						arm yourselves 
						the same thought, 
						because he 
								having suffered 
									in flesh 
									has been made to rest from sin, 
										for no longer to live 
										in lusts of men, 
											but the remaining time 
											in flesh in will of God. 
												For time of life 
													having passed is sufficient 
														for us to have worked out 
														the will of the nations, 
														having gone on 
															in wantonness, 
															lusts, 
															drunkenness, 
															parties, 
															carousings, 
															and lawless idolatries; 
								in which they are surprised, 
									you not running with
									into the same overflow of unsavedness, 
									blaspheming; 
										who will give account 
										to Him 
										having readiness to judge 
										living and dead. 
For to this also 
	the gospel was preached 
	to dead, 
		that they might be judged 
			according to men in flesh, 
			but might live 
			according to God in Spirit.```
