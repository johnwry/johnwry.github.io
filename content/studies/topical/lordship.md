Title: damnable heresies
---

Gotquestions.com says this:

\>Is it possible to be a Christian and live in lifelong carnality, enjoying the pleasures of sin, and never seeking to glorify the Lord who bought him? Can a sinner spurn the lordship of Christ yet lay claim to Him as Savior? Can someone pray a “sinner’s prayer” and go about his life as if nothing had happened and still call himself a “Christian”? Lordship salvation says “no.” Let us not give unrepentant sinners false hope; rather, let us declare the whole counsel of God: “You must be born again” ([John 3:7](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-7.html)).

  
Cheap grace- 

The guys over at theocast.org put these 5 points together which i think are good even though i don't agree with reformed teaching.

(1) confusion about the order of salvation; 

(2) a redefinition of faith; 

(3) a collapsing of law and gospel; 

(4) confusion on the uses of the law; 

(5) confusion of the relationship between justification and sanctification.

The only man who has the right to say that he is justified by grace alone is the man who has left all to follow Christ.\[^1\]

## Cheap vs Free Grace

When people call grace cheap, they prove to be misunderstanding grace. After all, a cheap car costs more than a free car. A cheap pizza still requires you to shell out a few dollars.
