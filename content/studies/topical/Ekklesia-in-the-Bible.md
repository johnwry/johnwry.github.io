**Conclusion**

 It is evident from the use of *ekklesia* in the Lxx that the word held a deep significance for Greek-speaking Jews. Although an *ekklesia* could be merely a crowd of people (I Samuel 17:47 [Lxx I Kings 17:47]) or an assembly of “evil-doers” (Psalm 26:5 [Lxx 25:5]), the “*ekklesia* of the LORD” was the covenantal assmbly of Israel (Deuteronomy 4:10). 

This body, when assembled, worshipped God (II Chronicles 29:28,31,32), appealed to God (II Chronicles 20:5), repented to God (Joel 2:16), and made choices for the nation as whole (I Chronicles 13:2,4; Ezra 10:12 [Lxx II Esdras 10:12]). 

To stand “in the midst of the *ekklesia*” was a significant responsibility (I Chronicles 28:2; II Chronicles 20:5). 

To face shame before the *ekklesia* was to be avoided (Proverbs 5:14). 

Not all who dwelt among the Israelites could enter the *ekklesia* (Deuteronomy 23:1-3, 8). 

To fail to come together in the *ekklesia* was a serious breech of duty (Judges 21:5; Ezra 10:8 [Lxx II Esdras 10:8]). Although the *ekklesia* could include men, women and children (Ezra 10:1 [Lxx II Esdras 10:1]), there is no example of a woman addressing what the Lxx calls the *ekklesia.*



EKKLESIA in the NT

Acts 19:32 - Así que unos gritaban una cosa y otros otra, porque había confusión en la asamblea, y la mayoría no sabía por qué razón se habían reunido.

Acts 19:41 - Y habiendo dicho esto, despidió la asamblea.

Por lo tanto se ve que en el uso corriente de la palabra era aplicada a cualquier cuerpo de gente reunida con algún propósito.



The word "ekklesia" is applied to God's people in the New Testament because it accurately describes them. 

​	They have been "called" 

​	from sin to holy living, 

​	from darkness to light, 

​	from the world into the kingdom of God. 

​		They are not called from the world in a physical sense, but in a moral and spiritual sense. "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you" (John 15:19). 

The called are God's people, whether physically assembled or not. This called body of people has a continuing existence. 

The jailer's household was his family (Acts 16:34), 

and God's household is God's family (1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:19). 

It would be absurd to think that God has a family in any given place only when Christians are assembled for worship.







ALERT:::: (some teach this error)

THE ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD “CHURCH”

With the trend toward the construction of buildings for the worship of God, it is not surprising that the translators of the English King James Bible chose to translate the Greek word “ekklesia” using the English word “church.” A deep look at the etymology of the word “church” can be quite revealing.

Going back in time, the English word “church” was derived from the Old English word cirice, related to the Norwegian/Scandinavian word kirkja. This, in turn, came from the Germanic word kirka; which was derived from the Greek word Kyrite; and this, in turn, was derived from the Greek word kurio, meaning “governor,” “lord,” “master.” In Greek, Kuriake oika means “the house of the lord.”

Thus, the word church came to mean “a building set apart or consecrated for public worship” {1}

Although the English word “church” does not have its root in the Greek term ekklesia, it is used to translate ekklesia. Ekklesia is a composition of two Greek words: ek, meaning “out of,” and kaleo, meaning “to call.” Combined, the word literally means “to call out.” Ekklesia was commonly used among the Greeks in reference to a body of citizens who “gathered” to discuss the affairs of state {1}. A correct and quite appropriate translation of ekklesia is “the called out ones,” although there are times when the context demands that “assembly” or “gathering of the called out ones” be other expressions used. The word has to do with a people who are “called out of” to congregate.
