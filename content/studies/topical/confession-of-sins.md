# Confession of Sins

## Searching what the Scriptures actually teach

### Note: It is not in the scope of this study but we will presume death in the Scriptures means separation not cessation of existence. 

# Spiritual Separation

## Man willfully sins, it is not God who makes him sin. 

<span class='bible'>
..."Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?" Genesis 3:11
</span>

### Yet, when Adam and Eve did sin, it was God who sought them out to restore fellowship. 

<span class='bible'>
They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" Genesis 3:8-9</span>

Notice that the purpose for hiding among the trees was not to hide from the heat or any other reason. They hid themselves *from the presence of the Lord*. 


### Sin resulted in fear of God, a change of perception of self,  and lead to hiding. 

<span class='bible'>He said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself." 
Genesis 3:10</span>

### They did not run to God, they ran from God

#### QUESTION: What would have happened if Adam and Eve had confessed their sin to God? 

##### A. **Option A** God would have forgiven them.

###### 1. if God would have forgiven them, then there's no need for the cross. 

##### B. **Option B** Nothing - God could not forgive them based on their confession. Payment for their sin needed to be made in order to right the wrong. 

## 1. Adam and Eve needed to restore the wrong with God somehow. 

## a. Sin could be paid for by good works

### i. of course this contradicts the whole of Scripture. 

## b. Sin could be erased

## c. Sin could be paid for

# Relational Separation

## While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion can. 

## When is fellowship broken between the believer and God? 

<span class='bible'>Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what **fellowship has light with darkness**? 2 Corinthians 6:14
</span>

<span class='bible'>for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk **as children of Light**.
Ephesians 5:8</span>

<span class='bible'>Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; **he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life**."
John 8:12</span>

## How is fellowship restored between the believer and God? 

### Does 1 John 1:9 teach that confession of sins restores our relationship with God? 

#### James tells us God IS light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
>This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
>
> -1 John 1:5

#### If we say we have fellowship with Him yet do not walk in fellowship we lie. 
> If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; 
> 
> -1 John 1:6

#### If we walk in the light we will have fellowship with one another - because we have fellowship with God. 
>but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.
>
> 1 John 1:7

#### If we say we have no sin, we aren't walking in the Light, because the light causes us to reveal our imperfections (sins) and we see our sin. 
>If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.
>
> 1 John 1:8

#### By walking in the Light, we are revealed our sins, we confess our sins and are cleansed in our fellowship with one another. 
>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
>
> 1 John 1:9
