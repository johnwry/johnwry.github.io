# Confession of Sins
## What the Scripture teaches

# Spiritual Separation
> Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" Genesis 3:9

# Relational Separation

## While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion can. 

## When is fellowship broken between the believer and God? 

> 2Co 6:14  Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what **fellowship has light with darkness**?

> Eph 5:8  for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk **as children of Light**

> Joh 8:12  Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; **he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life**."

## How is fellowship restored between the believer and God? 

### Does 1 John 1:9 teach that confession of sins restores our relationship with God? 

#### James tells us God IS light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
>1Jn 1:5  This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.

#### If we say we have fellowship with Him yet do not walk in fellowship we lie. 
> 1Jn 1:6  If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; 

#### If we walk in the light we will have fellowship with one another - because we have fellowship with God. 
>1Jn 1:7  but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.

#### If we say we have no sin, we aren't walking in the Light, because the light causes us to reveal our imperfections (sins) and we see our sin. 
>1Jn 1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.

#### By walking in the Light, we are revealed our sins, we confess our sins and are cleansed in our fellowship with one another. 
>1Jn 1:9  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
