# Confession of Sins
## What the Scripture teaches

# Spiritual Separation
> Then the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?" Genesis 3:9

# Relational Separation

## While the Father-child relation cannot broken with God, communion can. 

## When is fellowship broken between the believer and God? 

> 2Co 6:14  Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what **fellowship has light with darkness**?

> Eph 5:8  for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk **as children of Light**

> Joh 8:12  Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; **he who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life**."

## How is fellowship restored between the believer and God? 

### Does 1 John 1:9 teach that confession of sins restores our relationship with God? 

#### James tells us God IS light and in Him there is no darkness at all. 
>1Jn 1:5  This is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.

#### If we say we have fellowship with Him yet do not walk in fellowship we lie. 
> 1Jn 1:6  If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth; 

#### If we walk in the light we will have fellowship with one another - because we have fellowship with God. 
>1Jn 1:7  but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.

#### If we say we have no sin, we aren't walking in the Light, because the light causes us to reveal our imperfections (sins) and we see our sin. 
>1Jn 1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.

#### By walking in the Light, we are revealed our sins, we confess our sins and are cleansed in our fellowship with one another. 
>1Jn 1:9  If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

## Removal of guilt vs forgiveness of sins

> Hosea 10:2 Their heart is faithless; Now they must **bear their guilt.** The LORD will break down their altars *And* destroy their *sacred* pillars.

# Why isn’t confession of sin included in the things required for salvation?

January 6, 2024

## Question:

Why is the confession of sins not included in the steps to salvation (5 Steps of Salvation)? This question is prompted by verses such as [Matthew 3:6](https://ref.ly/Matt 3.6;esv?t=biblia), [Mark 1:5](https://ref.ly/Mark 1.5;esv?t=biblia), [Acts 19:18](https://ref.ly/Acts 19.18;esv?t=biblia), and [James 5:16](https://ref.ly/James 5.16;esv?t=biblia).

## Answer:

The confession of sin preceded John's baptism ([Matthew 3:6](https://ref.ly/Matt 3.6;esv?t=biblia); [Mark 1:5](https://ref.ly/Mark 1.5;esv?t=biblia)). While it might set precedence, it cannot be applied to Jesus' baptism without additional evidence.

[Acts 19:18](https://ref.ly/Acts 19.18;esv?t=biblia) refers to a confession of sin that took place by believers. "*Many also of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices*" ([Acts 19:18](https://ref.ly/Acts 19.18;esv?t=biblia)). The implication is that this was being done by Christians and not by people looking to become Christians. [James 5:16](https://ref.ly/James 5.16;esv?t=biblia) is of the same nature. James was addressed to Christians. He was telling Christians how to get help concerning sin. "*Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much*" ([James 5:16](https://ref.ly/James 5.16;esv?t=biblia)).

The purpose of confession is to face the fact that we sinned and that we are not going to hide from that fact. Unacknowledged sin destroys us internally. "*When I kept silent, my bones grew old through my groaning all the day long. For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my vitality was turned into the drought of summer. I acknowledged my sin to You, and my iniquity I have not hidden. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and You forgave the iniquity of my sin.*" ([Psalms 32:3-5](https://ref.ly/Ps 32.3-5;esv?t=biblia)). Confession is made to the ones we harmed by our sins. Since all sins are against God, the first and most important confession we need to make is to Him.

> "*This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie, and don't tell the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we haven't sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us*" ([I John 1:5-10](https://ref.ly/1 John 1.5-10;esv?t=biblia)).

Often the one in sin realizes how badly his sin affected his relationship with God and so he desires the support of his fellow Christians in approaching God. You can see this with Simon.

> "*Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit." But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn't right before God. Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity." Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken happen to me"*" *([Acts 8:18-24](https://ref.ly/Acts 8.18-24;esv?t=biblia))*.

This is what [James 5:16](https://ref.ly/James 5.16;esv?t=biblia) was talking about. [Acts 19:18](https://ref.ly/Acts 19.18;esv?t=biblia) is another example of this even though praying for the sinners wasn't mentioned.

The confession of sin is an ongoing need since sin is an ever-present problem. Usually, we talk about the steps to salvation to discuss what is needed before being saved by Christ's blood. A long time ago, some unknown preacher selected five major requirements because it makes memorizing what is necessary to be saved easier to remember (you can count them off on your fingers). However, the Bible connects much more to salvation than just five things. See [What Saves a Person?](https://www.lavistachurchofchrist.org/cms/what-saves-a-person/)
