## Romans 16:26 - Obedience of Faith

I would like to take a moment to look at the phrase *obedience of faith*.

Before we look at what it means, and since Paul mentions this phrase at the beginning and at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, we should look at his purpose for writing:

```     So, for my part, I am eager **to preach the gospel** to you also who are in Rome. Romans 1:15``

Obedience is a noun not a verb. This is a term or definition,  a title or description. It could describe the action or what results from the action.

'*But now*' making a distinction to that what was previous not known (v.25), kept a secret for ages past.

'*Is manifested*' refers back to the Gospel (the person and work of Jesus Christ) (v.25). We could paraphrase the verse (taking the liberty) 'but now [the gospel] is manifested to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith'.

Let's look to Scripture to help us interpret this. We know that Paul's purpose of writing Romans is to communicate the Gospel. How are obedience, faith and the Gospel connected?

We see in the beginning of the church that many of the priests were becoming obedient:

```     The word of God kept on spreading; and the number of the disciples continued to increase greatly in Jerusalem, and a great **many of the priests were becoming obedient to the faith**. Acts 6:7``

Those who are obedient, are given the Holy Spirit:

```     And we are witnesses of these things; and *so is* the Holy Spirit, whom **God has given to those who obey Him**.” Acts 5:32``

We also see that there are those who do not obey the Gospel:

```     dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to those **who do not obey the gospel** of our Lord Jesus. 2 Thessalonians 1:8``

So, we arrive at the question, how is is that one is obedient or disobedient in regards to the Gospel?  The Gospel of John may shed some light:

```     **He who believes in the Son has eternal life**; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.” John 3:36``

Clearly salvation is not by works (Ephesians 2:8-9). So salvation is not on the basis of doing or performing. Those who don't believe are considered disobedient however.

```     obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls. 1 Peter 1:9``

Peter uses it again in the same chapter to show how believers are title or identification of  '*obedient children*':

```     As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts *which were yours* in your ignorance, 1 Peter 1:14```

*Obedience of faith* could also be stated, 'obedience which is faith' when *faith comes by hearing and hearing the word of God* (Romans 10:17).

God has gifted to every person the possibility to exercise faith.  After hearing the message of the Gospel, they must trust, rest, believe it!

```     They said, “**Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved**, you and your household." Acts 16:31```

Paul (as an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles) desired that the preaching of the Gospel might be responded to by faith thereby bringing about the declaration of them being obedient.
Those who have been declared obedient, those who have trusted in what Christ did for them - dying for our sins and rising again, are to walk now by faith in their identity of obedient children.

If *you* have not made the decision to trust Christ personally - that he saved you from the penalty of your sin, you are considered disobedient before God and He will have to punish you. Trust Him by faith and find forgiveness of your sins today!
