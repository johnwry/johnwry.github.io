## Predestination

There is much confusion regarding this very wonderful doctrine. I do not wish to dwell on the different doctrines of predestination men have developed over the centuries but on what the Bible says regarding this beautiful subject.

> and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, **so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God**. 1 Corinthians 2:4-5

The natural man's faith is resting on the wisdom of men. Men's wisdom does not save but God's power does. Paul was speaking things in a manner that the natural man could understand the Gospel and place his trust in the power of God unto salvation - Jesus Christ who died and was buried and rose again.

However, to believers who have had the veil removed a wisdom from God which was predestined for all believers to have:

> Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, **the hidden \*wisdom\* which God predestined before the ages to our glory**; 1 Corinthians 2:6-7

God prepared these things beforehand for believers:

> but just as it is written,
> “Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,
> And *which* have not entered the heart of man,
> **All that God has prepared for those who love Him**.” 1 Corinthians 2:9

God predestined many things more for those in Christ:

He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the [[f](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph+1&version=NASB#fen-NASB-29212f)]kind intention of His will, Ephesians 1:5
