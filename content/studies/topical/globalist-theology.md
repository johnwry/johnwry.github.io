# Globalism and Theology

\>**Theological Elements in Globalism**

**>Foundational Questions**: Globalism’s underlying vision is rooted in foundational questions about God’s existence, His role in the universe, good and evil, life and death, and the meaning of salvation. This theological nature of globalism must be considered in any serious examination of globalization.

**>Alternative to Christianity**: Globalism presents an alternative to Christianity, with its own vision of the kingdom of Heaven realized in the current age. This challenges Christian theology and its understanding of salvation and the nature of God.\[^1\]
