Title: Hyper Grace...The latest fad in conversative theology
---



## Stegall’s “disagreement” points with hyper-grace (1 → 10, in his order)

Below is the numbered sequence he uses (“Here’s a ___ area of disagreement…”), summarized tightly but following his progression:

1. **Over-elevating love** as the controlling/primary attribute of God in a way that **pushes down holiness/wrath/justice** (he critiques the “God is love, therefore not wrath/justice” style argument). [SermonAudio+2SermonAudio+2](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
2. Rejecting/softening **propitiation** and **penal substitution**, preferring “expiation only,” because (he says) they don’t want God viewed as judge with wrath/justice satisfied at the cross. [SermonAudio+1](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
3. (Some) embracing **universalism / post-mortem second chance / annihilation**, instead of eternal conscious punishment (as he presents it). [SermonAudio](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
4. Claiming believers are **always pleasing to God** and God is **never disappointed**, including rhetoric that treating “aiming to please God” as legalism. [SermonAudio+1](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
5. Denying a distinction between **judicial forgiveness** and **parental forgiveness** for believers—specifically pushing back on the idea that ongoing confession (for family-fellowship) matters, and treating that as “law not grace.” [SermonAudio+2SermonAudio+2](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
6. Denying **progressive/practical sanctification** (or reframing it so heavily as “behavior” that it functionally dismisses real growth/transforming). [SermonAudio+1](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
7. Saying believers should never be called **“sinners”** (saints only), sometimes extending to **denial of an ongoing sin nature** in believers. [SermonAudio+1](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
8. Teaching that the **Holy Spirit does not convict believers of sin** (only unbelievers), sometimes on wordplay (“convict” ⇒ “convict/convicted criminal”). [SermonAudio+1](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
9. Treating it as legalistic to view oneself positionally as a **servant** (son only), and (in his Romans 6 discussion) downplaying the “present/yield yourselves” thrust that he thinks belongs with position truth. [SermonAudio+2SermonAudio+2](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)
10. Being **non-dispensational** (as he frames it) and therefore often denying **degrees of reward** for believers and **conflating** the Judgment Seat of Christ with final judgment for unbelievers. [SermonAudio+1](https://www.sermonaudio.com/km/sermons/114241543294109)

## Broader context you asked about: who “accuses” Free Grace, and who critiques hyper-grace?

If you want names (not just “camps”), these are some of the most visible streams:

- **Free Grace critics (often via the Lordship Salvation controversy):** John MacArthur and many Reformed-leaning voices argue the debate is about the nature/fruit of true faith (and frequently critique “easy believism”).

- **Free Grace critics (academic/pop-evangelical):** Wayne Grudem’s book/argument is a well-known “no” from a mainstream evangelical systematic-theology lane. [Grace Life+1](https://www.gracelife.org/resources/articles/?id=24&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Hyper-grace critics (charismatic/evangelical):** Michael L. Brown is one of the best-known critics who wrote a dedicated book specifically warning against “hyper-grace.” [Internet Archive+1](https://archive.org/details/hypergrace0000brow?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you want, I can also do the same kind of ordered list for Stegall’s *broader* framework in that session (his “two ditches” model: legalism ↔ license) and exactly what he says is wrong with certain *Free Grace* sub-groups (outer darkness talk; universalism drift), since he addresses those too. turn11view2
