## The Importance

Have you ever wondering why the apostle Paul writes an explanation of the Gospel to believers in Rome? Why does Paul clarify the Gospel to the Corinthian saints? Why would Paul defend the Gospel to the Galatian church? It seems redundant to waste words teaching the Gospel to believers.  

I was once laughed at for articulating the Gospel to a family who was interested in our ministry. I tried to impress on them the need we saw of clarifying the Gospel to people in this generation. I believe they thought I was treating them as ignorant (as unknowing) and perhaps they felt offended.  The fact is, I often shy away from sharing the Gospel especially among believers becuase I presume everybody already understands it. What's more, It's usually not for fear of being redundant but a fear of offending. 

Why would Paul write a lengthy letter to the Romans clarifying the Gospel? He already knew they were saved, in fact he affirms them in their identity in Christ at the beginning of the letter. The answer lies in what Paul understand of the purpose of the church. 

> **Rom 10:15** How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE THE FEET OF THOSE WHO BRING GOOD NEWS OF GOOD THINGS!"
