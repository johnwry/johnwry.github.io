Joh 11:1  Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
Joh 11:2  It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
Joh 11:3  So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, "Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick."
Joh 11:4  But when Jesus heard this, He said, "This sickness is not to end in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it."
Joh 11:5  Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
Joh 11:6  So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was.
Joh 11:7  Then after this He *said to the disciples, "Let us go to Judea again."
Joh 11:8  The disciples *said to Him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"
Joh 11:9  Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
Joh 11:10  "But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
Joh 11:11  This He said, and after that He *said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I go, so that I may awaken him out of sleep."
Joh 11:12  The disciples then said to Him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
Joh 11:13  Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking of literal sleep.
Joh 11:14  So Jesus then said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,
Joh 11:15  and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him."
Joh 11:16  Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him."
I Am the Resurrection and the Life

Joh 11:17  So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.
Joh 11:18  Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off;
Joh 11:19  and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
Joh 11:20  Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him, but Mary stayed at the house.
Joh 11:21  Martha then said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.
Joh 11:22  "Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You."
Joh 11:23  Jesus *said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
