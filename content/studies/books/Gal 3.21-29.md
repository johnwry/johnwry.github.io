Gal 3:21  Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? May it never be! For if a law had been given which was able to impart life, then righteousness would indeed have been based on law.
Gal 3:22  But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
Gal 3:23  But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.
Gal 3:24  Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith.
Gal 3:25  But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.
Gal 3:26  For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Gal 3:27  For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
Gal 3:28  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Gal 3:29  And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to promise.

Is the Law then contrary to the promises of God? 
May it never be! 
For if a law had been given 
which was able to impart life, 
then righteousness would indeed have been based on law. But the Scripture has shut up everyone under sin, 
	so that the promise 
	by faith in Jesus Christ 
	might be given to those
	who believe. 
But before faith came, 
we were kept in custody under the law, 
	being shut up to the faith 
	which was later to be revealed. 
Therefore the Law has become our tutor 
to lead us to Christ, 
so that we may be justified by faith. 
But now that faith has come, 
we are no longer under a tutor. 
For you are all sons of God 
through faith in Christ Jesus. 
For all of you 
	who were baptized into Christ 
have clothed yourselves with Christ. 
There is neither Jew nor Greek, 
there is neither slave nor free man, 
there is neither male nor female; 
for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 
And if you belong to Christ, 
then you are Abraham's descendants, 
	heirs according to promise.
