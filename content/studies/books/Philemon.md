# Philemon (NASB)

**Greeting**

Phm 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved *brother* and fellow worker,

Phm 1:2 and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:

Phm 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**Philemon's Love and Faith**

Phm 1:4 I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,

Phm 1:5 because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints;

Phm 1:6 *and I pray* that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the knowledge of every good thing which is in you for Christ's sake.

Phm 1:7 For I have come to have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.

**Paul's Plea for Onesimus**

Phm 1:8 Therefore, though I have enough confidence in Christ to order you *to do* what is proper,

Phm 1:9 yet for love's sake I rather appeal *to you*—since I am such a person as Paul, the aged, and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—

Phm 1:10 I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,

Phm 1:11 who formerly was useless to you, but now is useful both to you and to me.

Phm 1:12 I have sent him back to you in person, that is, *sending* my very heart,

Phm 1:13 whom I wished to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might minister to me in my imprisonment for the gospel;

Phm 1:14 but without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness would not be, in effect, by compulsion but of your own free will.

Phm 1:15 For perhaps he was for this reason separated *from you* for a while, that you would have him back forever,

Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

Phm 1:17 If then you regard me a partner, accept him as *you would* me.

Phm 1:18 But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge that to my account;

Phm 1:19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand, I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self as well).

Phm 1:20 Yes, brother, let me benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.

Phm 1:21 Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, since I know that you will do even more than what I say.

Phm 1:22 At the same time also prepare me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I will be given to you.

**Final Greetings

Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,

Phm 1:24 *as do* Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow workers.

Phm 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

# I. Philemon Outlined

# A. Introduction

## Main Characters

### Paul - Never been to Colossae but Philemon was probably a disciple from the school of Tyrannus in Ephesus. 3 months + 2 years. acts 19:8-10

### Philemon - only mentioned in this book. Slave owner. Believers met in his house so we conclude he was probably wealthy. Model Christian and a great blessing to Paul. 

### Onesimus - 1 Corinthians 7:21-24 

### 1. The letter of Philemon is short but the content of this short letter is very profound.  

####  a. On a **socioeconomic level**: A prisoner writes regarding a slave to his slave master. The slave had stolen (either by running away or taking something with him) from his master. 

##### 1) The letter is a sincere request to the slave master (Philemon) to receive the slave (Onesimus) back based on the intercession of the prisoner (Paul). 

###### i) Paul attests to Onesimus as now useful 

###### ii) Paul will pay for any debt Onesimus might have with Philemon

###### iii) Paul's request is to receive Onesimus back (mercy) but also as an equal brother (grace).

#### b. On a **spiritual level**: Paul, Onesimus and Philemon are brothers in Christ before anything else. This means that issues of ethical, moral injustice are handled in a Christ-like fashion. 

##### 1) brothers, partners with God now mean much more than slave, prisoner or master. 

##### 2) The Gospel lived out produces refreshment

###### i) Onesimus refreshed Paul's heart

###### ii) Philemon will also refresh Paul's heart

### 2. Where is the Gospel? Ironically Philemon is Paul's only letter that doesn't mention Jesus's death, burial and resurrection. 

The Gospel is the transformative power by which we see lives changed. 

Paul intercedes and will pay for any debt Onesimus has. 

Onesimus has been transformed from useless to useful in the ministry.  Onesimus will return willingly to Philemon.

Philemon is encouraged to willingly forgive Onesimus. 

### 3. Paul had discipled two men

#### a. Philemon. Philemon is a "partner" implying they are together in a common mission as disciple makers. Philemon 1:19

#### b. Onesimus. Onesimus became a believer and was discipled by Paul. 

# B. Philemon 1:1-7  Greetings

### 1. Philemon 1:1 *Paul,* *a prisoner of Christ Jesus,* Paul considered himself a slave, apostle and prisoner of Jesus Christ. 

#### a. Paul was in prison for preaching the Gospel. Philemon 1:13

#### b. Paul was a prisoner when he wrote this.  The context seems to indicate Rome.

#### c. Paul served prison sentences in Caesarea by the sea (Acts 23:23-26:32), Philippi (Acts 16:16-36), Rome (Acts 28:17-31). 

### 2. Philemon 1:1 *and Timothy* *our brother,...* *our* - Timothy wasn't only Paul's brother, he is also Philemon's brother. 

### 3. Philemon 1:1 *To Philemon* *our beloved brother* *and fellow worker,* 

#### Philemon was their brother

#### Philemon was a "fellow worker". Paul used this term in reference to workers for the Gospel of Christ (1 Thessalonians 3:2), 

##### builders of the Church (1 Corinthians 3:9). Paul mentions several in this way.  Romans 16:3; Philemon 1:24l Luke 10:2; 1 Corinthians 3:9; Philippians 2:25; Philippians 4:3, Colossians 4:11 

### 4. Philemon 1:1 *and to Apphia* *our sister,* 

### 5. Philemon 1:1 *and to Archippus* *our fellow soldier,* 

### 6. Philemon 1:1 *and to the church* *in your house:* 

#### a. Philemon 1: *Grace to you and peace* you (plural) Paul's wishes were not only to Philemon, but to all the church in Philemon's home.

### Philemon 1: *from God our Father*  Grace and peace are not something Paul wishes them from himself but rather the grace and peace that come from God and the Lord Jesus.

#### Philemon 1: *and the Lord Jesus Christ.* Jesus is named in various ways in the letter. 

##### Christ Jesus. Philemon 1:1

##### Lord Jesus Christ. Philemon 1:4

##### Christ. Philemon 1:8

##### Christ Jesus. Philemon 1:9

##### The Lord. Philemon 1:20
