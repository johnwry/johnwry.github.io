# The Book of Galatians

In the world we live in, the Sin Nature rules. It shows its ugly self through ..."*immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these...*" - Galatians 5:19-21

How do we deal with these issues in the church? 

The compelling argument of the judaizing-missionaries to Galatia was to become jewish proselites. That is, the christian converts needed to become observers of the law. 

Steps to becoming good (Acts 15:5): 

1. Believe in Jesus
2. Be circumcised
3. Keep the Law 

In Contrast to the teaching of the legalists, Paul's argument is this: The Galatians had come to be justified (declared righteous) before God by the Spirit. Now, in like manner, they were now to walk by the Spirit.  What he meant is this, when believers are lead by the Holy Spirit, they will be governed from within. Walking by the Spirit, results in the production of Spirit fruit, which is described as being...*love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.* - Galatians 5:22-23

impatience vs patience. Envy vs self-control, disputes vs peace. 

Anger vs joy.
