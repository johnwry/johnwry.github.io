[**Gal 1:11** ](verseid:48.1.11) For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.

[**Gal 1:12** ](verseid:48.1.12) For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but *I received it* through a revelation of Jesus Christ.

[**Gal 1:13** ](verseid:48.1.13) For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;

[**Gal 1:14** ](verseid:48.1.14) and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.

[**Gal 1:15** ](verseid:48.1.15) But when God, who had set me apart *even* from my mother's womb and called me through His grace, was pleased

[**Gal 1:16** ](verseid:48.1.16) to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,

[**Gal 1:17** ](verseid:48.1.17) nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.

[**Gal 1:18** ](verseid:48.1.18) Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.

[**Gal 1:19** ](verseid:48.1.19) But I did not see any other of the apostles except James, the Lord's brother.

[**Gal 1:20** ](verseid:48.1.20) (Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)

[**Gal 1:21** ](verseid:48.1.21) Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

[**Gal 1:22** ](verseid:48.1.22) I was *still* unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;

[**Gal 1:23** ](verseid:48.1.23) but only, they kept hearing, "He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy."

[**Gal 1:24** ](verseid:48.1.24) And they were glorifying God because of me.

For I would have you know, 

​							brethren, 

​										that the gospel 

​															which was preached 

​																				by me 

​															is not according to man. 

​															For I neither received it 

​																								from man, 

​																								nor was I taught it, 

​															but *I received it* 

​																					through a revelation 

​																										of Jesus Christ. 

For you have heard 

of my former manner 

of life in Judaism, 

​	how I used to persecute 

​								the church of God beyond measure 

​											and tried to destroy it; 

​	and I was advancing in Judaism 

​	beyond many of my contemporaries 

​					among my countrymen, 

​			being more extremely zealous 

​			for my ancestral traditions. 

But when God, 

​					who had set me apart 

​												*even* from my mother's womb 

​					and called me 

​							through His grace, 

was pleased to reveal His Son in me 

​					so that I might preach 

​												Him among the Gentiles, 

I did not immediately consult 

with flesh and blood, 

nor did I go up to Jerusalem 

to those who were apostles before me; 

but I went away to Arabia, 

and returned once more to Damascus. 

Then three years later 

I went up to Jerusalem 

to become acquainted with Cephas, 

and stayed with him fifteen days. 

But I did not see any other of the apostles 

except James, 

the Lord's brother. 

(Now in what I am writing to you, 

I assure you before God that I am not lying.) 

Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 

I was *still* unknown 

by sight to the churches of Judea 

which were in Christ; 

but only, they kept hearing, 

"He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith 

which he once tried to destroy." 

And they were glorifying God 

because of me.
