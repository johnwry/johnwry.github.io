[**Rom 8:18** ](verseid:45.8.18) For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.

[**Rom 8:19** ](verseid:45.8.19) For the anxious longing of the creation waits eagerly for the revealing of the sons of God.

[**Rom 8:20** ](verseid:45.8.20) For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, in hope

[**Rom 8:21** ](verseid:45.8.21) that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.

[**Rom 8:22** ](verseid:45.8.22) For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.

[**Rom 8:23** ](verseid:45.8.23) And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for *our*adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.

[**Rom 8:24** ](verseid:45.8.24) For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one also hope for what he sees?

[**Rom 8:25** ](verseid:45.8.25) But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it.

[**Rom 8:26** ](verseid:45.8.26) And in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for *us* with groanings too deep for words;

[**Rom 8:27** ](verseid:45.8.27) and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to *the will of* God.

[**Rom 8:28** ](verseid:45.8.28) And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to *His* purpose.

For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us. 

For the anxious longing of the creation 

waits eagerly 

for the revealing of the sons of God. 

For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but because of Him who subjected it, 

in hope 

[Rom 4:18](verseid:45.4.18) In **hope** G1680  against [G1909](num:G1909)  **hope** G1680  he believed [G4100](num:G4100) , so [G3779](num:G3779)  that he might become [G1096](num:G1096) R1 a father [G3962](num:G3962)  of many [G4183](num:G4183)  nations [G1484](num:G1484)  according [G2596](num:G2596)  to that which had been spoken [G3004](num:G3004) , " R2 SO [G3779](num:G3779)  SHALL YOUR  N1 DESCENDANTS [G4690](num:G4690)  BE."

[Rom 5:2](verseid:45.5.2) through [G1223](num:G1223)  whom [G3739](num:G3739)  also [G2532](num:G2532)  we have  R1 obtained [G2192](num:G2192)  our introduction [G4318](num:G4318)  by faith [G4102](num:G4102)  into this [G3778](num:G3778)  grace [G5485](num:G5485) R2 in which [G3739](num:G3739)  we stand [G2476](num:G2476) ; and  N1 we exult [G2744](num:G2744)  in **hope** G1680  of the glory [G1391](num:G1391)  of God [G2316](num:G2316) .

[Rom 5:4](verseid:45.5.4) and  R1 perseverance [G5281](num:G5281) ,  R2 proven [G1382](num:G1382)  character [G1382](num:G1382) ; and proven [G1382](num:G1382)  character [G1382](num:G1382) , **hope** G1680 ;

[Rom 5:5](verseid:45.5.5) and **hope** G1680 R1 does not disappoint [G2617b](num:G2617b) , because [G3754](num:G3754)  the love [G26](num:G26)  of God [G2316](num:G2316)  has been  R2 poured [G1632b](num:G1632b)  out within [G1722](num:G1722)  our hearts [G2588](num:G2588)  through [G1223](num:G1223)  the Holy [G40](num:G40)  Spirit [G4151](num:G4151)  who was given [G1325](num:G1325)  to us.

[Rom 8:20](verseid:45.8.20) For the creation [G2937](num:G2937) R1 was subjected [G5293](num:G5293)  to  R2 futility [G3153](num:G3153) , not willingly [G1635](num:G1635) , but  R3 because [G1223](num:G1223)  of Him who subjected [G5293](num:G5293)  it,  N1 in **hope** G1680 

[Rom 8:24](verseid:45.8.24) For  R1 in **hope** G1680  we have been saved [G4982](num:G4982) , but  R2 **hope** G1680  that is seen [G991](num:G991)  is not **hope** G1680 ; for who [G5100](num:G5100)  **hopes** [G1679](num:G1679)  for what [G3739](num:G3739)  he *already* sees [G991](num:G991) ?

[Rom 12:12](verseid:45.12.12)  R1 rejoicing [G5463](num:G5463)  in **hope** G1680 ,  R2 persevering [G5278](num:G5278)  in tribulation [G2347](num:G2347) ,  R3 devoted [G4342](num:G4342)  to prayer [G4335](num:G4335) ,

[Rom 15:4](verseid:45.15.4) For  R1 whatever [G3745](num:G3745)  was written [G4270](num:G4270)  in earlier [G4270](num:G4270)  times [G4270](num:G4270)  was written [G1125](num:G1125)  for our instruction [G1319](num:G1319) , so [G2443](num:G2443)  that through [G1223](num:G1223)  perseverance [G5281](num:G5281)  and the encouragement [G3874](num:G3874)  of the Scriptures [G1124](num:G1124)  we might have [G2192](num:G2192)  **hope** G1680 .

[Rom 15:13](verseid:45.15.13) Now [G1161](num:G1161)  may the God [G2316](num:G2316)  of **hope** G1680  fill [G4137](num:G4137)  you with all [G3956](num:G3956) R1 joy [G5479](num:G5479)  and peace [G1515](num:G1515)  in believing [G4100](num:G4100) , so [G1519](num:G1519)  that you will abound [G4052](num:G4052)  in **hope** G1680 R2 by the power [G1411](num:G1411)  of the Holy [G40](num:G40)  Spirit [G4151](num:G4151) .

that the creation itself also will be set free from its slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now. And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for *our*adoption as sons, the redemption of our body. For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one also hope for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, with perseverance we wait eagerly for it. And in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for *us* with groanings too deep for words; and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to *the will of* God. And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to *His* purpose.
