Joh 11:35  Jesus wept.
Joh 11:36  So the Jews were saying, "See how He loved him!"
Joh 11:37  But some of them said, "Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind man, have kept this man also from dying?"
Jesus Raises Lazarus

Joh 11:38  So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
Joh 11:39  Jesus *said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the sister of the deceased, *said to Him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days."
Joh 11:40  Jesus *said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?"
Joh 11:41  So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised His eyes, and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
Joh 11:42  "I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me."
Joh 11:43  When He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth."
Joh 11:44  The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. Jesus *said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."
The Plot to Kill Jesus

Joh 11:45  Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.
Joh 11:46  But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.
Joh 11:47  Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council, and were saying, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs.
Joh 11:48  "If we let Him go on like this, all men will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."

Jesus wept. 

​			So the Jews were saying, 

​				"See how He loved him!" 

​				But some of them said, 

​			"Could not this man, 

who opened the eyes of the blind man, 

have kept this man also from dying?" 

So Jesus, 

again being deeply moved within, 

*came to the tomb. 

Now it was a cave, 

and a stone was lying against it. 

Jesus *said, "Remove the stone." 

Martha, 

the sister of the deceased, 

*said to Him, 

"Lord, by this time there will be a stench, 

for he has been dead four days." 

Jesus *said to her, 

"Did I not say to you 

that if you believe, 

you will see the glory of God?" 

So they removed the stone. 

Then Jesus raised His eyes, 

and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. 

"I knew that You always hear Me; 

but because of the people standing around I said it, 

so that they may believe that You sent Me." 

When He had said these things, 

He cried out with a loud voice, 

"Lazarus, come forth." 

The man 

who had died came forth, 

bound hand and foot 

with wrappings, 

and his face was wrapped around with a cloth. 

Jesus *said to them, 

"Unbind him, and let him go." 

Therefore many of the Jews 

who came to Mary, 

and saw what He had done, 

believed in Him. 

But some of them went to the Pharisees 

and told them the things 

which Jesus had done. 

Therefore the chief priests 

and the Pharisees 

convened a council, 

and were saying, 

"What are we doing? 

For this man is performing many signs. 

"If we let Him go on like this, 

all men will believe in Him, 

and the Romans will come 

and take away both 

our place 

and our nation."
