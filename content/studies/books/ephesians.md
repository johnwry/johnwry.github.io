[**Eph 1:1** ](verseid:49.1.1) Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are at Ephesus and *who are* faithful in Christ Jesus:

[**Eph 1:2** ](verseid:49.1.2) Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Spiritual Blessings in Christ

[**Eph 1:3** ](verseid:49.1.3) Blessed *be* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly *places* in Christ,

[**Eph 1:4** ](verseid:49.1.4) just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love

[**Eph 1:5** ](verseid:49.1.5) He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,

[**Eph 1:6** ](verseid:49.1.6) to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.

[**Eph 1:7** ](verseid:49.1.7) In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace

[**Eph 1:8** ](verseid:49.1.8) which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight

[**Eph 1:9** ](verseid:49.1.9) He made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him

[**Eph 1:10** ](verseid:49.1.10) with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, *that is,* the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him

[**Eph 1:11** ](verseid:49.1.11) also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,

[**Eph 1:12** ](verseid:49.1.12) to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory.

[**Eph 1:13** ](verseid:49.1.13) In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise,

[**Eph 1:14** ](verseid:49.1.14) who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of *God's own* possession, to the praise of His glory.

Thanksgiving and Prayer

[**Eph 1:15** ](verseid:49.1.15) For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which *exists* among you and your love for all the saints,

[**Eph 1:16** ](verseid:49.1.16) do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention *of you* in my prayers;

[**Eph 1:17** ](verseid:49.1.17) that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him.

[**Eph 1:18** ](verseid:49.1.18) *I pray that* the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,

[**Eph 1:19** ](verseid:49.1.19) and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. *These are* in accordance with the working of the strength of His might

[**Eph 1:20** ](verseid:49.1.20) which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly *places,*

[**Eph 1:21** ](verseid:49.1.21) far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.

[**Eph 1:22** ](verseid:49.1.22) And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church,

[**Eph 1:23** ](verseid:49.1.23) which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.

[**Eph 2:1** ](verseid:49.2.1) And you were dead in your trespasses and sins,

[**Eph 2:2** ](verseid:49.2.2) in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.

[**Eph 2:3** ](verseid:49.2.3) Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.

[**Eph 2:4** ](verseid:49.2.4) But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,

[**Eph 2:5** ](verseid:49.2.5) even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),

[**Eph 2:6** ](verseid:49.2.6) and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly *places*in Christ Jesus,

[**Eph 2:7** ](verseid:49.2.7) so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

[**Eph 2:8** ](verseid:49.2.8) For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, *it is* the gift of God;

[**Eph 2:9** ](verseid:49.2.9) not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.

[**Eph 2:10** ](verseid:49.2.10) For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.

One in Christ

[**Eph 2:11** ](verseid:49.2.11) Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called "Uncircumcision" by the so-called "Circumcision," *which is* performed in the flesh by human hands—

[**Eph 2:12** ](verseid:49.2.12) *remember* that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

[**Eph 2:13** ](verseid:49.2.13) But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

[**Eph 2:14** ](verseid:49.2.14) For He Himself is our peace, who made both *groups into* one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall,

[**Eph 2:15** ](verseid:49.2.15) by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, *which is* the Law of commandments *contained* in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, *thus* establishing peace,

[**Eph 2:16** ](verseid:49.2.16) and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.

[**Eph 2:17** ](verseid:49.2.17) AND HE CAME AND PREACHED PEACE TO YOU WHO WERE FAR AWAY, AND PEACE TO THOSE WHO WERE NEAR;

[**Eph 2:18** ](verseid:49.2.18) for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father.

[**Eph 2:19** ](verseid:49.2.19) So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God's household,

[**Eph 2:20** ](verseid:49.2.20) having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner *stone,*

[**Eph 2:21** ](verseid:49.2.21) in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,

[**Eph 2:22** ](verseid:49.2.22) in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.

[**Eph 3:1** ](verseid:49.3.1) For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—

[**Eph 3:2** ](verseid:49.3.2) if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace which was given to me for you;

[**Eph 3:3** ](verseid:49.3.3) that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief.

[**Eph 3:4** ](verseid:49.3.4) By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,

[**Eph 3:5** ](verseid:49.3.5) which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;

[**Eph 3:6** ](verseid:49.3.6) *to be specific,* that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,

[**Eph 3:7** ](verseid:49.3.7) of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God's grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.

[**Eph 3:8** ](verseid:49.3.8) To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,

[**Eph 3:9** ](verseid:49.3.9) and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things;

[**Eph 3:10** ](verseid:49.3.10) so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly *places.*

[**Eph 3:11** ](verseid:49.3.11) *This was* in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,

[**Eph 3:12** ](verseid:49.3.12) in whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.

[**Eph 3:13** ](verseid:49.3.13) Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory.

Prayer for Spiritual Strength

[**Eph 3:14** ](verseid:49.3.14) For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,

[**Eph 3:15** ](verseid:49.3.15) from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,

[**Eph 3:16** ](verseid:49.3.16) that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man,

[**Eph 3:17** ](verseid:49.3.17) so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; *and* that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

[**Eph 3:18** ](verseid:49.3.18) may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,

[**Eph 3:19** ](verseid:49.3.19) and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.

[**Eph 3:20** ](verseid:49.3.20) Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,

[**Eph 3:21** ](verseid:49.3.21) to Him *be* the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.

[**Eph 4:1** ](verseid:49.4.1) Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called,

[**Eph 4:2** ](verseid:49.4.2) with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,

[**Eph 4:3** ](verseid:49.4.3) being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

[**Eph 4:4** ](verseid:49.4.4) *There is* one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;

[**Eph 4:5** ](verseid:49.4.5) one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

[**Eph 4:6** ](verseid:49.4.6) one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.

[**Eph 4:7** ](verseid:49.4.7) But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.

[**Eph 4:8** ](verseid:49.4.8) Therefore it says, "WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN."

[**Eph 4:9** ](verseid:49.4.9) (Now this *expression,* "He ascended," what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth?

[**Eph 4:10** ](verseid:49.4.10) He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.)

[**Eph 4:11** ](verseid:49.4.11) And He gave some *as* apostles, and some *as* prophets, and some *as*evangelists, and some *as* pastors and teachers,

[**Eph 4:12** ](verseid:49.4.12) for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;

[**Eph 4:13** ](verseid:49.4.13) until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.

[**Eph 4:14** ](verseid:49.4.14) As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming;

[**Eph 4:15** ](verseid:49.4.15) but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all *aspects* into Him who is the head, *even* Christ,

[**Eph 4:16** ](verseid:49.4.16) from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.

The New Life

[**Eph 4:17** ](verseid:49.4.17) So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind,

[**Eph 4:18** ](verseid:49.4.18) being darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;

[**Eph 4:19** ](verseid:49.4.19) and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.

[**Eph 4:20** ](verseid:49.4.20) But you did not learn Christ in this way,

[**Eph 4:21** ](verseid:49.4.21) if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus,

[**Eph 4:22** ](verseid:49.4.22) that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit,

[**Eph 4:23** ](verseid:49.4.23) and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind,

[**Eph 4:24** ](verseid:49.4.24) and put on the new self, which in *the likeness of* God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.

[**Eph 4:25** ](verseid:49.4.25) Therefore, laying aside falsehood, SPEAK TRUTH EACH ONE *of you* WITH HIS NEIGHBOR, for we are members of one another.

[**Eph 4:26** ](verseid:49.4.26) BE ANGRY, AND *yet* DO NOT SIN; do not let the sun go down on your anger,

[**Eph 4:27** ](verseid:49.4.27) and do not give the devil an opportunity.

[**Eph 4:28** ](verseid:49.4.28) He who steals must steal no longer; but rather he must labor, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have *something* to share with one who has need.

[**Eph 4:29** ](verseid:49.4.29) Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such *a word* as is good for edification according to the need *of the moment,* so that it will give grace to those who hear.

[**Eph 4:30** ](verseid:49.4.30) Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

[**Eph 4:31** ](verseid:49.4.31) Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.

[**Eph 4:32** ](verseid:49.4.32) Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.

[**Eph 5:1** ](verseid:49.5.1) Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;

[**Eph 5:2** ](verseid:49.5.2) and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.

[**Eph 5:3** ](verseid:49.5.3) But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;

[**Eph 5:4** ](verseid:49.5.4) and *there must be no* filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.

[**Eph 5:5** ](verseid:49.5.5) For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

[**Eph 5:6** ](verseid:49.5.6) Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

[**Eph 5:7** ](verseid:49.5.7) Therefore do not be partakers with them;

[**Eph 5:8** ](verseid:49.5.8) for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light

[**Eph 5:9** ](verseid:49.5.9) (for the fruit of the Light *consists* in all goodness and righteousness and truth),

[**Eph 5:10** ](verseid:49.5.10) trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.

[**Eph 5:11** ](verseid:49.5.11) Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;

[**Eph 5:12** ](verseid:49.5.12) for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.

[**Eph 5:13** ](verseid:49.5.13) But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.

[**Eph 5:14** ](verseid:49.5.14) For this reason it says, "Awake, sleeper, And arise from the dead, And Christ will shine on you."

[**Eph 5:15** ](verseid:49.5.15) Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise,

[**Eph 5:16** ](verseid:49.5.16) making the most of your time, because the days are evil.

[**Eph 5:17** ](verseid:49.5.17) So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

[**Eph 5:18** ](verseid:49.5.18) And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit,

[**Eph 5:19** ](verseid:49.5.19) speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;

[**Eph 5:20** ](verseid:49.5.20) always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;

[**Eph 5:21** ](verseid:49.5.21) and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.

Wives and Husbands

[**Eph 5:22** ](verseid:49.5.22) Wives, *be subject* to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

[**Eph 5:23** ](verseid:49.5.23) For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself *being* the Savior of the body.

[**Eph 5:24** ](verseid:49.5.24) But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives *ought to be* to their husbands in everything.

[**Eph 5:25** ](verseid:49.5.25) Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,

[**Eph 5:26** ](verseid:49.5.26) so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,

[**Eph 5:27** ](verseid:49.5.27) that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.

[**Eph 5:28** ](verseid:49.5.28) So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;

[**Eph 5:29** ](verseid:49.5.29) for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also *does* the church,

[**Eph 5:30** ](verseid:49.5.30) because we are members of His body.

[**Eph 5:31** ](verseid:49.5.31) FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND SHALL BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH.

[**Eph 5:32** ](verseid:49.5.32) This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.

[**Eph 5:33** ](verseid:49.5.33) Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and the wife must *see to it* that she respects her husband.

[**Eph 6:1** ](verseid:49.6.1) Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.

[**Eph 6:2** ](verseid:49.6.2) HONOR YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER (which is the first commandment with a promise),

[**Eph 6:3** ](verseid:49.6.3) SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU, AND THAT YOU MAY LIVE LONG ON THE EARTH.

[**Eph 6:4** ](verseid:49.6.4) Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

Bondservants and Masters

[**Eph 6:5** ](verseid:49.6.5) Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;

[**Eph 6:6** ](verseid:49.6.6) not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.

[**Eph 6:7** ](verseid:49.6.7) With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men,

[**Eph 6:8** ](verseid:49.6.8) knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.

[**Eph 6:9** ](verseid:49.6.9) And masters, do the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him.

The Whole Armor of God

[**Eph 6:10** ](verseid:49.6.10) Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.

[**Eph 6:11** ](verseid:49.6.11) Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil.

[**Eph 6:12** ](verseid:49.6.12) For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness in the heavenly *places.*

[**Eph 6:13** ](verseid:49.6.13) Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm.

[**Eph 6:14** ](verseid:49.6.14) Stand firm therefore, HAVING GIRDED YOUR LOINS WITH TRUTH, and HAVING PUT ON THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS,

[**Eph 6:15** ](verseid:49.6.15) and having shod YOUR FEET WITH THE PREPARATION OF THE GOSPEL OF PEACE;

[**Eph 6:16** ](verseid:49.6.16) in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil *one.*

[**Eph 6:17** ](verseid:49.6.17) And take THE HELMET OF SALVATION, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

[**Eph 6:18** ](verseid:49.6.18) With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints,

[**Eph 6:19** ](verseid:49.6.19) and *pray* on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,

[**Eph 6:20** ](verseid:49.6.20) for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

Final Greetings

[**Eph 6:21** ](verseid:49.6.21) But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you.

[**Eph 6:22** ](verseid:49.6.22) I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.

[**Eph 6:23** ](verseid:49.6.23) Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

[**Eph 6:24** ](verseid:49.6.24) Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible *love.*

*The Letter of Paul to the*

EPHESIANS



*The Blessings of Redemption*

​	**Eph 1:1** 	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus cby the will of God, 

**To** the dsaints who are at Ephesus and *who are* faithful in Christ Jesus: 

​	**2** 	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

​	**3** 	Blessed *be* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly *places* in Christ, 

​	**4** 	just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love 

​	**5** 	He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, 

​	**6** 	to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. 

​	**7** 	In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace 

​	**8** 	which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight 

​	**9** 	He amade known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him 

​	**10** 	with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, *that is*, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him 

​	**11** 	also we ahave obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, 

​	**12** 	to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory. 

​	**13** 	In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, 

​	**14** 	who is agiven as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of *God’s own* possession, to the praise of His glory. 

​	**15** 	For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which *exists* among you and your love for all the saints, 

​	**16** 	do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention *of you* in my prayers; 

​	**17** 	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. 

​	**18** 	*I pray that* the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, 

​	**19** 	and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. *These are* in accordance with the working of the strength of His might 

​	**20** 	which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly *places*, 

​	**21** 	far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. 

​	**22** 	And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, 

​	**23** 	which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. 



*Made Alive in Christ*

​	**2:1** 	And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, 

​	**2** 	in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 

​	**3** 	Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. 

​	**4** 	But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, 

​	**5** 	even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), 

​	**6** 	and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly *places* in Christ Jesus, 

​	**7** 	so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 

​	**8** 	For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, *it is* the gift of God; 

​	**9** 	not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. 

​	**10** 	For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. 

​	**11** 	Therefore **remember** that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” *which is* performed in the flesh by human hands— 

​	**12** 	*remember* that you were at that time separate from Christ, aexcluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 

​	**13** 	But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near dby the blood of Christ. 

​	**14** 	For He Himself is our peace, who made both *groups into* one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 

​	**15** 	by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, *which is* the Law of commandments *contained* in ordinances, so that in Himself He might cmake the two into one new man, *thus* establishing peace, 

​	**16** 	and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. 

​	**17** 	And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; 

​	**18** 	for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. 

​	**19** 	So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, 

​	**20** 	having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner *stone*, 

​	**21** 	in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, 

​	**22** 	in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. 



*Paul’s Stewardship*

​	**3:1** 	For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— 

​	**2** 	if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you; 

​	**3** 	that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. 

​	**4** 	By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 

​	**5** 	which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 

​	**6** 	*to be specific*, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, 

​	**7** 	of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. 

​	**8** 	To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, 

​	**9** 	and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; 

​	**10** 	so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly *places.* 

​	**11** 	*This was* in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, 

​	**12** 	in whom we have boldness and aconfident access through faith in Him. 

​	**13** 	Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory. 

​	**14** 	For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 

​	**15** 	from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, 

​	**16** 	that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, 

​	**17** 	so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; *and* that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 

​	**18** 	may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 

​	**19** 	and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. 

​	**20** 	Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, 

​	**21** 	to Him *be* the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. 



*Unity of the Spirit*

​	**4:1** 	Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 

​	**2** 	with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, 

​	**3** 	being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 

​	**4** 	*There is* one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; 

​	**5** 	one Lord, one faith, one baptism, 

​	**6** 	one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. 

​	**7** 	But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. 

​	**8** 	Therefore it says, 

“When He ascended on high, 

He led captive a host of captives, 

And He gave gifts to men.” 

​	**9** 	(Now this *expression,* “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? 

​	**10** 	He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) 

​	**11** 	And He gave some *as* apostles, and some *as* prophets, and some *as* evangelists, and some *as* pastors and teachers, 

​	**12** 	for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; 

​	**13** 	until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the bknowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 

​	**14** 	As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; 

​	**15** 	but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all *aspects* into Him who is the head, *even* Christ, 

​	**16** 	from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. 

*The Christian’s Walk*

​	**17** 	So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, 

​	**18** 	being darkened in their understanding, bexcluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; 

​	**19** 	and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. 

​	**20** 	But you did not learn Christ in this way, 

​	**21** 	if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, 

​	**22** 	that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, 

​	**23** 	and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 

​	**24** 	and put on the new self, which cin *the likeness of* God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. 

​	**25** 	Therefore, laying aside falsehood, **speak** truth each one *of you* with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. 

​	**26** 	Be **angry**, and *yet* do not **sin**; do not let the sun **go down** on your anger, 

​	**27** 	and do not **give** the devil an opportunity. 

​	**28** 	He who steals must **steal** no longer; but rather he must **labor**, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have *something* to share with one who has need. 

​	**29** 	Let no aunwholesome word **proceed** from your mouth, but only such *a word* as is good for edification according to the need *of the moment,* so that it will give grace to those who hear. 

​	**30** 	Do not **grieve** the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. 

​	**31** 	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be **put away** from you, along with all malice. 

​	**32** 	**Be** kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. 



*Be Imitators of God*

​	**5:1** 	Therefore **be** imitators of God, as beloved children; 

​	**2** 	and **walk** in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. 

​	**3** 	But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be **named** among you, as is proper among saints; 

​	**4** 	and *there must be no* filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 

​	**5** 	For this **you know with certainty**, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. 

​	**6** 	Let no one **deceive** you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 

​	**7** 	Therefore do not **be** partakers with them; 

​	**8** 	for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; **walk** as children of Light 

​	**9** 	(for the fruit of the Light *consists* in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 

​	**10** 	atrying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 

​	**11** 	Do not **participate** in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even  **expose** them; 

​	**12** 	for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. 

​	**13** 	But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. 

​	**14** 	For this reason it says, 

“**Awake**, sleeper, 

And **arise** from the dead, 

And Christ will shine on you.” 

​	**15** 	Therefore **be careful** how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, 

​	**16** 	amaking the most of your time, because the days are evil. 

​	**17** 	So then do not **be** foolish, but **understand** what the will of the Lord is. 

​	**18** 	And do not **get drunk** with wine, for that is dissipation, but be **filled** with the Spirit, 

​	**19** 	speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 

​	**20** 	always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to bGod, even the Father; 

​	**21** 	and be subject to one another in the bfear of Christ. 

*Marriage Like Christ and the Church*

​	**22** 	Wives, *be subject* to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 

​	**23** 	For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself *being* the Savior of the body. 

​	**24** 	But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives *ought to be* to their husbands in everything. 

​	**25** 	Husbands, **love** your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, 

​	**26** 	so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, 

​	**27** 	that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. 

​	**28** 	So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; 

​	**29** 	for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also *does* the church, 

​	**30** 	because we are members of His body. 

​	**31** 	For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. 

​	**32** 	This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. 

​	**33** 	Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to **love** his own wife even as himself, and the wife must *see to it* that she brespects her husband. 



*Family Relationships*

​	**6:1** 	Children, **obey** your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 

​	**2** 	**Honor** your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), 

​	**3** 	so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth. 

​	**4** 	Fathers, do not **provoke** your children **to anger**, but **bring** them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. 

​	**5** 	Slaves, be **obedient** to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; 

​	**6** 	not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. 

​	**7** 	With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, 

​	**8** 	knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. 

​	**9** 	And masters, **do** the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. 

*The Armor of God*

​	**10** 	Finally, be **strong** in the Lord and in the strength of His might. 

​	**11** 	**Put on** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. 

​	**12** 	For our struggle is not against bflesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness in the heavenly *places.* 

​	**13** 	Therefore, **take up** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 

​	**14** 	**Stand** firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 

​	**15** 	and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 

​	**16** 	in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil *one.* 

​	**17** 	And **take** the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 

​	**18** 	With all prayer and petition bpray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, dbe on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, 

​	**19** 	and *pray* on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, 

​	**20** 	for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 

​	**21** 	But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. 

​	**22** 	aI have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. 

​	**23** 	Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

​	**24** 	Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible *love*.

The Letter of Paul to the*

EPHESIANS

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus cby the will of God, To the dsaints who are at Ephesus and *who are* faithful in Christ Jesus: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed *be* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly *places* in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will, to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the Beloved. In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace which He lavished on us. In all wisdom and insight He amade known to us the mystery of His will, according to His kind intention which He purposed in Him with a view to an administration suitable to the fullness of the times, *that is*, the summing up of all things in Christ, things in the heavens and things on the earth. In Him also we ahave obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will, to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of His glory. In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation—having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is agiven as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of *God’s own* possession, to the praise of His glory. For this reason I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which *exists* among you and your love for all the saints, do not cease giving thanks for you, while making mention *of you* in my prayers; that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him. *I pray that* the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. *These are* in accordance with the working of the strength of His might which He brought about in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly *places*, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. And He put all things in subjection under His feet, and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. And you were dead in your trespasses and sins, in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly *places* in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come He might show the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, *it is* the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them. Therefore **remember** that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” *which is* performed in the flesh by human hands— *remember* that you were at that time separate from Christ, aexcluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near dby the blood of Christ. For He Himself is our peace, who made both *groups into* one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, *which is* the Law of commandments *contained* in ordinances, so that in Himself He might cmake the two into one new man, *thus* establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near; for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the Father. So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner *stone*, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit. For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace which was given to me for you; that by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote before in brief. By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; *to be specific*, that the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel, of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power. To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ, and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things; so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly *places.* *This was* in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and aconfident access through faith in Him. Therefore I ask you not to lose heart at my tribulations on your behalf, for they are your glory. For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; *and* that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God. Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to Him *be* the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen. Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. *There is* one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all. But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ’s gift. Therefore it says, “When He ascended on high, He led captive a host of captives, And He gave gifts to men.” (Now this *expression,* “He ascended,” what does it mean except that He also had descended into the lower parts of the earth? He who descended is Himself also He who ascended far above all the heavens, so that He might fill all things.) And He gave some *as* apostles, and some *as* prophets, and some *as* evangelists, and some *as* pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the bknowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ. As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming; but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all *aspects* into Him who is the head, *even* Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love. So this I say, and affirm together with the Lord, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, bexcluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; and they, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you did not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which cin *the likeness of* God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. Therefore, laying aside falsehood, **speak** truth each one *of you* with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. Be **angry**, and *yet* do not **sin**; do not let the sun **go down** on your anger, and do not **give** the devil an opportunity. He who steals must **steal** no longer; but rather he must **labor**, performing with his own hands what is good, so that he will have *something* to share with one who has need. Let no aunwholesome word **proceed** from your mouth, but only such *a word* as is good for edification according to the need *of the moment,* so that it will give grace to those who hear. Do not **grieve** the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be **put away** from you, along with all malice. **Be** kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Therefore **be** imitators of God, as beloved children; and **walk** in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma. But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be **named** among you, as is proper among saints; and *there must be no* filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. For this **you know with certainty**, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one **deceive** you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not **be** partakers with them; for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; **walk** as children of Light (for the fruit of the Light *consists* in all goodness and righteousness and truth), atrying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. Do not **participate** in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even  **expose** them; for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. For this reason it says, “**Awake**, sleeper, And **arise** from the dead, And Christ will shine on you.” Therefore **be careful** how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, amaking the most of your time, because the days are evil. So then do not **be** foolish, but **understand** what the will of the Lord is. And do not **get drunk** with wine, for that is dissipation, but be **filled** with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to bGod, even the Father; and be subject to one another in the bfear of Christ. Wives, *be subject* to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself *being* the Savior of the body. But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives *ought to be* to their husbands in everything. Husbands, **love** your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself; for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also *does* the church, because we are members of His body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church. Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to **love** his own wife even as himself, and the wife must *see to it* that she brespects her husband. Children, **obey** your parents in the Lord, for this is right. **Honor** your father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise), so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth. Fathers, do not **provoke** your children **to anger**, but **bring** them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. Slaves, be **obedient** to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ; not by way of eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. With good will render service, as to the Lord, and not to men, knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free. And masters, **do** the same things to them, and give up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with Him. Finally, be **strong** in the Lord and in the strength of His might. **Put on** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against bflesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness in the heavenly *places.* Therefore, **take up** the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. **Stand** firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil *one.* And **take** the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition bpray at all times in the Spirit, and with this in view, dbe on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints, and *pray* on my behalf, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains; that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. But that you also may know about my circumstances, how I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make everything known to you. aI have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible *love*.

*The Letter of Paul to the*
# EPHESIANS

Paul, 

	an apostle 

		of Christ Jesus 

		by the will of God, 

To the saints 

	who are 

		at Ephesus 

	and *who are*

		faithful in Christ Jesus: 

Grace to you 

and peace from God 

	our Father 

	and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Blessed *be* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

	who has blessed us 

		with every spiritual blessing 

			in the heavenly *places* in Christ, 

				just as He chose us 
				
					in Him 

					before the foundation of the world, 

						that we would be 

							holy 

							and blameless 

							before Him. 

	In love He predestined us 

		to adoption as sons 

			through Jesus Christ 

				to Himself, 

			according to the kind intention of His will, 

			to the praise of the glory of His grace, 

				which He freely bestowed on us 

				in the Beloved. 

		In Him we have redemption 

			through His blood, 

			the forgiveness of our trespasses, 

				according to the riches of His grace 

					which He lavished on us. 

		In all wisdom and insight 
		
		He made known to us 

				the mystery of His will, 

					according to His kind intention 

						which He purposed 

							in Him 

							with a view to an administration suitable 

							to the fullness of the times, 

							*that is*, the summing up of all things 
								
								in Christ, 

									things in the heavens 
									
									and things on the earth. 

		In Him also we ahave obtained an inheritance, 

			having been predestined 

				according to His purpose 

					who works all things 
					
						after the counsel of His will, 

							to the end that we 

								who were the first 
								
									to hope in Christ 

								would be to the praise of His glory. 

			In Him, you also, 

				after listening to the message of truth, 

					the gospel of your salvation—

				having also believed, 

					you were sealed 
					
						in Him 
					
						with the Holy Spirit of promise, 

							who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, 

								with a view 
								
									to the redemption 
									
										of *God’s own* possession, 

										to the praise of His glory. 

For this reason I too, 

	having heard 
		
		of the faith 
			
			in the Lord Jesus 

			which *exists* among you 
			
		and your love 
		
			for all the saints, 

		do not cease giving thanks for you, 

			while making mention *of you* 
				
				in my prayers; 

			that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

				the Father of glory, 

			may give to you 
		
				a spirit of wisdom 

				and of revelation 

					in the knowledge of Him. 

		*I pray that* 

			the eyes of your heart 

				may be enlightened, 

				so that you will know 

					what is the hope of His calling, 

					what are the riches of the glory 
			
						of His inheritance in the saints, 

					and what is the surpassing greatness 
			
						of His power toward us who believe. 

					*These are* in accordance 

						with the working 
						
						of the strength of His might 

							which He brought about in Christ, 

								when He raised Him from the dead 

								and seated Him at His right hand 

								in the heavenly *places*, 

									far above all 

										rule 

										and authority 

										and power 

										and dominion, 

										and every name that is named, 

										not only in this age 

										but also in the one to come. 

									And He put all things 
									
									in subjection under His feet, 

									and gave Him as head 

									over all things to the church, 

										which is His body, 

										the fullness of Him 

										who fills all in all. 

And you were dead 

	in your trespasses 

	and sins, 

		in which you formerly walked 

			according to the course of this world, 

			according to the prince of the power of the air, 

				of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 

Among them we too 

	all formerly lived 
	
	in the lusts of our flesh, 

		indulging the desires of the flesh 
		
		and of the mind, 

		and were by nature children of wrath, 

			even as the rest. 

But God, 

	being rich in mercy, 

	because of His great love 

	with which He loved us, 

	even when we were dead in our transgressions, 

		made us alive 
		
			together with Christ 
			
				(by grace you have been saved), 

			and raised us up with Him, 

			and seated us with Him 

				in the heavenly *places* 
				
					in Christ Jesus, 

				so that in the ages to come 
				
					He might show the surpassing riches of His grace 
						
						in kindness toward us 
						
							in Christ Jesus. 

For by grace 

	you have been saved 

		through faith; 

		and that not of yourselves, 

			*it is* the gift of God; 

				not as a result of works, 

					so that no one may boast. 

				For we are His workmanship, 

					created in Christ Jesus 

						for good works, 

							which God prepared beforehand 

							so that we would walk 
							
								in them. 

Therefore **remember** 

	that formerly you, 

		the Gentiles in the flesh, 

			who are called “Uncircumcision” 
			
					by the so-called “Circumcision,” 

						*which is* performed in the flesh 
						
							by human hands— 

*remember* that you were at that time 

	separate from Christ, 

	excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, 

	and strangers to the covenants of promise, 

	having no hope 
	
	and without God in the world. 

But now 

	in Christ Jesus you 
	
		who formerly were far off 

			have been brought near 

			by the blood of Christ. 

	For He Himself is our peace, 

		who made both *groups into* one 

		and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 

		by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, 

		*which is* the Law of commandments 

			*contained* in ordinances, 

		so that 
		
		in Himself 
		
			He might make the two 
			
				into one new man, 

			*thus* establishing peace, 

				and might reconcile them both 

					in one body to God 

					through the cross, 

					by it having put to death the enmity. 

			And He came 
			
				and preached peace to you 

					who were far away, 

				and peace to those 

					who were near; 

				for through Him we both have our access 

					in one Spirit 

						to the Father. 

So then you are no longer 

	strangers 
	
	and aliens, 

but you are 
	
	fellow citizens with the saints, 

	and are of God’s household, 

		having been built 
		
			on the foundation of the apostles 
			
			and prophets, 

				Christ Jesus Himself 

					being the corner *stone*, 

					in whom the whole building, 

						being fitted together, 

						is growing into a holy temple 

						in the Lord, 

					in whom you also 

						are being built together 

							into a dwelling of God 

								in the Spirit. 

For this reason 

	I, Paul, 

		the prisoner of Christ Jesus 

			for the sake of you Gentiles— 

			if indeed you have heard 

of the stewardship of God’s grace 

		which was given to me for you; 

that by revelation 

	there was made known to me the mystery, 

as I wrote before in brief. 

	By referring to this, 

		when you read you can understand my insight 

			into the mystery of Christ, 

				which in other generations was not made known 
				
				to the sons of men, 

		as it has now been revealed 
		
		to His holy apostles and prophets 

			in the Spirit; 

	*to be specific*, 

		that the Gentiles 

			are fellow heirs 

			and fellow members 

				of the body, 

			and fellow partakers 

				of the promise in Christ Jesus 

					through the gospel, 

						of which I was made a minister, 

						according to the gift of God’s grace 

							which was given to me 

								according to the working of His power. 

To me, 

	the very least of all saints, 

		this grace was given, 

				to preach to the Gentiles 
				
					the unfathomable riches of Christ, 

					and to bring to light 
					
						what is the administration 
						
						of the mystery 

							which for ages 
							
								has been hidden in God 

									who created all things; 

								so that the manifold wisdom of God 
									
									might now be made known 

										through the church 

											to the rulers 

											and the authorities 

											in the heavenly *places.* 

									*This was* 
									
									in accordance 
									
									with the eternal purpose 

										which He carried out 
										
											in Christ Jesus our Lord, 

												in whom 

													we have boldness 

													and confident access 

													through faith in Him. 

Therefore I ask you 

	not to lose heart at my tribulations 

		on your behalf, 

		for they are your glory. 

For this reason 

	I bow my knees before the Father, 

		from whom every family 

			in heaven 

			and on earth 

			derives its name, 

		that He would grant you, 

			according to the riches of His glory, 

				to be strengthened 

				with power 

					through His Spirit 

						in the inner man, 

						so that Christ may dwell 

						in your hearts 

						through faith; 

				*and* that you, 

						being rooted 

						and grounded 
						
							in love, 

						may be able to comprehend 

							with all the saints 

								what is 

									the breadth 

									and length 

									and height 

									and depth, 

								and to know 
								
									the love of Christ 

										which surpasses knowledge, 

									that you may be filled up 
									
										to all the fullness of God. 

Now to Him 

	who is able to do 

		far more abundantly 

		beyond all that we ask or think, 

			according to the power that works within us, 

	to Him *be* the glory 

		in the church 

		and in Christ Jesus 

			to all generations forever and ever. Amen. 

Therefore I, 

	the prisoner of the Lord, 

		implore you to walk 

			in a manner worthy of the calling 

				with which you have been called, 

					with all humility 

					and gentleness, 

					with patience, 

					showing tolerance for one another 
					
						in love, 

						being diligent 

						to preserve the unity of the Spirit 

							in the bond of peace. 

							*There is* 

								one body 

								and one Spirit, 

								just as also you were called 

								in one hope of your calling; 

								one Lord, 

								one faith, 

								one baptism, 

								one God and Father of all 

									who is 
									
										over all 

										and through all 

										and in all. 

# But to each one of us 

#	grace was given 

##		according to the measure of Christ’s gift. 

##		Therefore it says, 

##			“When He ascended on high, 

##				He led captive a host of captives, 

##				And He gave gifts to men.” 

### (Now this *expression,* 

###	“He ascended,” 

###		what does it mean 
		
###			except that He also had descended 
			
###				into the lower parts of the earth? 

###	He who descended 
	
###		is Himself also He who ascended 
		
###			far above all the heavens, 
			
###			so that He might fill all things.) 

#		And He gave some 

			*as* apostles, 

		and some 
		
			*as* prophets, 

		and some 
		
			*as* evangelists, 

		and some 
		
			*as* pastors and teachers, 

				for the equipping of the saints 

				for the work of service, 

				to the building up of the body of Christ; 

					until we all attain to the unity of the faith, 

					and of the knowledge of the Son of God, 

						to a mature man, 

							to the measure of the stature 

							which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 

As a result, 

	we are no longer to be children, 

		tossed here and there 

			by waves 

			and carried about 
			
				by every wind of doctrine, 

				by the trickery of men, 

				by craftiness in deceitful scheming; 

			but speaking the truth in love, 

				we are to grow up in all *aspects* 
				
					into Him 

						who is the head, 

							*even* Christ, 

								from whom the whole body, 

									being fitted 

									and held together 

									by what every joint supplies, 

										according to the proper 
											
											working of each individual part, 

												causes the growth of the body 
												
												for the building up of itself in love. 
```
# The Gentiles' Manner

```markdown
So this I say, 

	and affirm together with the Lord, 

		that you walk 
		
			no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, 

				in the futility of their mind, 

				being darkened in their understanding, 

					excluded from the life of God 

					because of the ignorance that is in them, 

					because of the hardness of their heart; 

					and they, 
					
						having become callous, 

						have given themselves over to sensuality 

							for the practice 

								of every kind of impurity 

									with greediness. 

				But you did not learn Christ in this way, 

					if indeed you have heard Him 

					and have been taught in Him, 

						just as truth is in Jesus, 

					that, in reference to your former manner of life, 

						you lay aside the old self, 

							which is being corrupted 
							
							in accordance with the lusts of deceit, 

							and that you be renewed 
							
							in the spirit of your mind, 

								and put on the new self, 

									which in *the likeness of* God 
									
										has been created 

											in righteousness 

											and holiness 
											
											of the truth. 

Therefore, 

	laying aside falsehood, 

		**speak** truth 
		
			each one *of you* 
		
			with his neighbor, 

				for we are members of one another. 

		Be **angry**, 
		
			and *yet* do not **sin**; 

			do not let the sun **go down** on your anger, 

			and do not **give** the devil an opportunity. 

				He who steals must **steal** no longer; 

					but rather he must **labor**, 

						performing with his own hands what is good, 

							so that he will have *something* to share 

								with one who has need. 

						Let no aunwholesome word **proceed** from your mouth, 

						but only such *a word* as is good for edification 

							according to the need *of the moment,* 

								so that it will give grace 
								
									to those who hear. 

					Do not **grieve** the Holy Spirit of God, 

						by whom you were sealed 

							for the day of redemption. 

					Let all 
					
						bitterness 

						and wrath 

						and anger 

						and clamor 

						and slander 

						be **put away** from you, 

					along with all malice. 

				**Be** kind to one another, 

					tender-hearted, 

						forgiving each other, 

							just as God 
							
								in Christ 
							
								also has forgiven you. 

						Therefore **be** imitators of God, 

							as beloved children; 

						and **walk** in love, 

							just as Christ 
							
							also loved you 
							
							and gave Himself up 
							
							for us, 

								an offering 
								
								and a sacrifice 
								
								to God 
								
									as a fragrant aroma. 

									But 

										immorality 

										or any impurity 

										or greed 

											must not even be **named** among you, 

												as is proper among saints; 

												and *there must be no* 

													filthiness 

													and silly talk, 

													or coarse jesting, 

													which are not fitting, 

													but rather giving of thanks. 

												For this **you know with certainty**, 

												that no 

														immoral 

														or impure person 

														or covetous man, 

														who is an idolater, 

														has an inheritance 
														
														in the kingdom of Christ and God. 

Let no one **deceive** you 

	with empty words, 

	for because of these things the wrath of God 
	
	comes upon the sons of disobedience. 

Therefore 

	do not **be** partakers with them; 

		for you were 
		
			formerly darkness, 

		but now you are 
			
			Light in the Lord; 

			**walk** as children of Light 

				(for the fruit of the Light *consists* 

					in all goodness 

					and righteousness 

					and truth), 

						trying to learn 
						
						what is pleasing to the Lord. 

				Do not **participate** 
				
					in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, 

						but instead even  **expose** them; 

							for it is disgraceful 

							even to speak of the things 

								which are done by them in secret. 

							But all things become visible 
							
							when they are exposed by the light, 

							for everything that becomes visible is light. 

	For this reason it says, 

		“**Awake**, sleeper, 

		And **arise** from the dead, 

			And Christ will shine on you.” 

Therefore 

	**be careful** how you walk, 

		not as unwise men but as wise, 

			making the most of your time, 

			because the days are evil. 

			So then do not **be** foolish, 

			but **understand** what the will of the Lord is. 

		And do not **get drunk** with wine, 

			for that is dissipation, 

				but be **filled** with the Spirit, 

					speaking to one another 

						in psalms 

						and hymns 

						and spiritual songs, 

						singing 

						and making melody 

							with your heart 
							
								to the Lord; 

									always giving thanks 
									
										for all things 

										in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ 

											to God, 

												even the Father; 

														and be subject 

																to one another 

																	in the fear of Christ. 

Wives, 

	*be subject* to your own husbands, 

		as to the Lord. 

			For the husband is the head of the wife, 

				as Christ also is the head of the church, 

						He Himself 

							*being* the Savior of the body. 

					But as the church is subject to Christ, 

						so also the wives 
						
						*ought to be* to their husbands 

							in everything. 

Husbands, 

	**love** your wives, 

		just as Christ also 
		
		loved the church 
		
		and gave Himself up 
		
		for her, 

		so that He might sanctify her, 

			having cleansed her 
			
				by the washing of water 

					with the word, 

					that He might present 

						to Himself the church 
						
						in all her glory, 

							having 
							
								no spot 
								
								or wrinkle 
								
								or any such thing; 

						but that she would be 

							holy 

							and blameless. 

		So husbands 
		
			ought also to love their own wives 

				as their own bodies. 

				He who loves his own wife 
				
				loves himself; 

					for no one ever hated his own flesh, 

					but nourishes 
					
					and cherishes it, 

						just as Christ also *does* the church, 

							because we are members of His body. 

						For this reason 
						
							a man shall leave his father and mother 

								and shall be joined to his wife, 

								and the two shall become one flesh. 

This mystery is great; 

	but I am speaking with reference 

		to Christ 
			
		and the church. 

	Nevertheless, 
	
	each individual among you 
	
		also is to **love** his own wife 

		even as himself, 

	and the wife 
		
		must *see to it* 
		
		that she respects her husband. 

Children, 

	**obey** your parents 
	
		in the Lord, 
	
		for this is right. 

	**Honor** your father and mother 

		(which is the first commandment with a promise), 

		so that it may be well with you, 

		and that you may live long on the earth. 

Fathers, 

	do not **provoke** your children **to anger**, 

	but **bring** them up 

		in the discipline 

		and instruction 

		of the Lord. 

Slaves, 

	be **obedient** to those 

		who are your masters 

			according to the flesh, 

			with fear and trembling, 

				in the sincerity of your heart, 

					as to Christ; 

						not by way of eyeservice, 

						as men-pleasers, 

						but as slaves of Christ, 

							doing the will of God 
							
							from the heart. 

						With good will render service, 

							as to the Lord, 

							and not to men, 

								knowing that 
								
									whatever good thing each one does, 

										this he will receive back 
										
										from the Lord, 

											whether slave or free. 

And masters, 

	**do** the same things to them, 

	and give up threatening, 

	knowing that both 
	
		their Master 
		
		and yours is in heaven, 

			and there is no partiality with Him. 

Finally, 

	be **strong** 
	
		in the Lord 

	and in the strength 
	
		of His might. 

	**Put on** the full armor of God, 

		so that you will be able to stand firm 

			against the schemes of the devil. 

		For our struggle is not against 

			flesh 

			and blood, 

				but 
				
					against the rulers, 

					against the powers, 

					against the world forces of this darkness, 

					against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness 

					in the heavenly *places.* 

Therefore, 
	
	**take up** 

		the full armor of God, 

		so that you will be able to resist 
		
			in the evil day, 

		and having done everything, 

			to stand firm. 

	**Stand** firm therefore, 

		having girded your loins 
		
			with truth, 

		and having put on 
		
			the breastplate of righteousness, 

		and having shod your feet 
		
			with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 

in addition to all, 

	taking up the shield of faith 

		with which you will be able 
		
		to extinguish all 
		
		the flaming arrows of the evil *one.* 

	And **take** the helmet of salvation, 

	and the sword of the Spirit, 

		which is the word of God. 

	With all prayer and petition pray at all times 
	
		in the Spirit, 

	and with this in view, 

		be on the alert 

			with all perseverance 

			and petition 
			
				for all the saints, 

		and *pray* on my behalf, 

			that utterance may be given to me 

				in the opening of my mouth, 

					to make known 

					with boldness 
					
					the mystery of the gospel, 

						for which I am an ambassador 
						
						in chains; 

						that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, 

							as I ought to speak. 

						But that you also may know about my circumstances, 

							how I am doing, 

Tychicus, 

	the beloved brother 

	and faithful minister 
	
	in the Lord, 

	will make everything known to you. 

	I have sent him to you 
	
	for this very purpose, 

		so that you may know about us, 

		and that he may comfort your hearts. 

Peace be to the brethren, 

and love with faith, 

	from God the Father 

	and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Grace be with all those 

	who love our Lord Jesus Christ 

	with incorruptible *love*.

#	who has blessed us 
## with every spiritual blessing 
###		in the heavenly *places* 
###			in Christ,
```
### 1. Blessed chosen in Him to be blameless
```markdown
##				just as 
#				He chose us in Him 
##					before the foundation of the world, 
###						that we would be 
####							holy 
####							and blameless 
####							before Him. 
```
### 2. Blessed with adoption as sons
```markdown
## In love 
# He predestined us 
# to adoption 
##					as sons 
###						through Jesus Christ 
###							to Himself,

### 4. Blessed with the Knowledge of His will
```markdown
##				In all wisdom and insight 		
#					He made known to us

###								in Him 
###								with a view to an administration suitable 
###								to the fullness of the times,

```markdown
##						In Him, you also, 
##				after listening to the message of truth, 
##						the gospel of your salvation—
##						having also believed, 
#				you were sealed in Him 					
#					with the Holy Spirit of promise, 
##						who is given 
##						as a pledge of our inheritance, 
###								with a view 								
###									to the redemption 							
###										of *God’s own* possession, 
###										to the praise of His glory. 
```
## C. Paul's prayer for the Ephesian saints
```markdown
For this reason I too, 
	having heard 		
		of the faith 		
			in the Lord Jesus 
			which *exists* among you 		
		and your love 	
			for all the saints, 
		do not cease giving thanks for you, 
			while making mention *of you* 			
				in my prayers; 
			that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
				the Father of glory, 
			may give to you 		
				a spirit of wisdom 
				and of revelation 
					in the knowledge of Him. 
#		 *I pray that* 
#			the eyes of your heart 
#				may be enlightened, 
##				so that you will know 
###					what is the hope of His calling, 
###					what are the riches of the glory 		
###						of His inheritance in the saints, 
###					and what is the surpassing greatness 		
###						of His power toward us who believe. 
###					*These are* in accordance 
###						with the working 					
###						of the strength of His might 
####							which He brought about in Christ, 
###								when He raised Him from the dead 
###								and seated Him at His right hand 
###								in the heavenly *places*, 
###									far above all 
###										rule 
###										and authority 
###										and power 
###										and dominion, 
###										and every name that is named, 
####										not only in this age 
####										but also in the one to come. 
###									And He put all things 					
###									in subjection under His feet, 
###									and gave Him as head 
###									over all things to the church, 
####										which is His body, 
####										the fullness of Him 
####										who fills all in all. 
```
## D. Saved by Grace
```markdown
# And you were dead 
#	in your trespasses 
#	and sins, 
##		in which you formerly walked 
###			according to the course of this world, 
###			according to the prince of the power of the air, 
###				of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience. 
Among them we too 
	all formerly lived 
	in the lusts of our flesh, 
		indulging the desires of the flesh 
		and of the mind, 
		and were by nature children of wrath, 
			even as the rest. 
# But God, 
	being rich in mercy, 
	because of His great love 
	with which He loved us, 
	even when we were dead in our transgressions, 
#		made us alive 	
#			together with Christ 	
##				(by grace you have been saved), 
#			and raised us up with Him, 
#			and seated us with Him 
#				in the heavenly *places* 	
##					in Christ Jesus, 
##				so that in the ages to come 	
###					He might show the surpassing riches of His grace 		
###						in kindness toward us 
###							in Christ Jesus. 
# For 
	by grace 
you have been saved 
	through faith; 
	and that 
not of yourselves, 
	*it is* the gift of God; 
			not as a result of works, 
					so that no one may boast. 
				For we are His workmanship, 
					created in Christ Jesus 
						for good works, 
							which God prepared beforehand 
							so that we would walk 							
								in them. 
Therefore **remember** 
	that formerly you, 
		the Gentiles in the flesh, 
			who are called “Uncircumcision” 			
					by the so-called “Circumcision,” 
						*which is* performed in the flesh 		
							by human hands— 
*remember* that you were at that time 
	separate from Christ, 
	excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, 
	and strangers to the covenants of promise, 
	having no hope 	
	and without God in the world. 
But now 
	in Christ Jesus you 	
		who formerly were far off 
			have been brought near 
			by the blood of Christ. 
	For He Himself is our peace, 
		who made both *groups into* one 
		and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 
		by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, 
		*which is* the Law of commandments 
			*contained* in ordinances, 
		so that 	
		in Himself 	
			He might make the two 		
				into one new man, 
			*thus* establishing peace, 
				and might reconcile them both 
					in one body to God 
					through the cross, 
					by it having put to death the enmity. 
			And He came 		
				and preached peace to you 
					who were far away, 
				and peace to those 
					who were near; 
				for through Him we both have our access 
					in one Spirit 
						to the Father. 
So then you are no longer 
	strangers 	
	and aliens, 
but you are 	
	fellow citizens with the saints, 
	and are of God’s household, 
		having been built 		
			on the foundation of the apostles 			
			and prophets, 
				Christ Jesus Himself 
					being the corner *stone*, 
					in whom the whole building, 
						being fitted together, 
						is growing into a holy temple 
						in the Lord, 
					in whom you also 
						are being built together 
							into a dwelling of God 
								in the Spirit. 
```
## E. The mystery of Christ

```markdown
For this reason 
	I, Paul, 
		the prisoner of Christ Jesus 
			for the sake of you Gentiles— 
			if indeed you have heard 
of the stewardship of God’s grace 
		which was given to me for you; 
that by revelation 
	there was made known to me the mystery, 
as I wrote before in brief. 
	By referring to this, 
		when you read you can understand my insight 
			into the mystery of Christ, 
				which in other generations was not made known 				
				to the sons of men, 
		as it has now been revealed 		
		to His holy apostles and prophets 
			in the Spirit; 
	*to be specific*, 
		that the Gentiles 
			are fellow heirs 
			and fellow members 
				of the body, 
			and fellow partakers 
				of the promise in Christ Jesus 
					through the gospel, 
						of which I was made a minister, 
						according to the gift of God’s grace 
							which was given to me 
								according to the working of His power. 
To me, 
	the very least of all saints, 
		this grace was given, 
				to preach to the Gentiles 				
					the unfathomable riches of Christ, 
					and to bring to light 					
						what is the administration 						
						of the mystery 
							which for ages 							
								has been hidden in God 
									who created all things; 
								so that the manifold wisdom of God
									might now be made known 
										through the church 
											to the rulers 
											and the authorities 
											in the heavenly *places.* 
									*This was* 									
									in accordance 									
									with the eternal purpose 
										which He carried out 					
											in Christ Jesus our Lord, 
												in whom 
													we have boldness 
													and confident access 
													through faith in Him. 
Therefore I ask you 
	not to lose heart at my tribulations 
		on your behalf, 
		for they are your glory. 
For this reason 
	I bow my knees 
		before the Father, 
			from whom every family 
				in heaven 
				and on earth 
				derives its name, 
			that He would grant you, 
				according to the riches of His glory, 
					to be strengthened 
						with power 
							through His Spirit 
								in the inner man, 
									so that Christ may dwell 
										in your hearts 
											through faith; 
						*and* that you, 
							being rooted 
							and grounded 						
							in love, 
						may be able to comprehend 
							with all the saints 
								what is 
									the breadth 
									and length 
									and height 
									and depth, 
								and to know 								
									the love of Christ 
										which surpasses knowledge, 
									that you may be filled up 			
										to all the fullness of God. 
Now to Him 
	who is able to do 
		far more abundantly 
		beyond all that we ask or think, 
			according to the power that works within us, 
	to Him *be* the glory 
		in the church 
		and in Christ Jesus 
			to all generations forever and ever. Amen. 
```
## F. The Walk Worthy of the Calling

```markdown
Therefore I, 
	the prisoner of the Lord, 
		implore you to 
#		walk in a manner worthy of the calling 
				with which you have been called, 
#					with all humility 
#					and gentleness, 
#					with patience, 
#					showing tolerance for one another 			
##						in love, 
##						being diligent 
##						to preserve the unity of the Spirit 
##							in the bond of peace. 
							*There is* 
								one body 
								and one Spirit, 
								just as also you were called 
								in one hope of your calling; 
								one Lord, 
								one faith, 
								one baptism, 
								one God and Father of all 
									who is 									
										over all 
										and through all 
										and in all. 
But to each one of us 
	grace was given 
		according to the measure of Christ’s gift. 
		Therefore it says, 
			“When He ascended on high, 
				He led captive a host of captives, 
				And He gave gifts to men.” 
				(Now this *expression,* 
				“He ascended,” 
				what does it mean 
				except that He also had descended 			
				into the lower parts of the earth? 
				He who descended 
				is Himself also He who ascended 
					far above all the heavens, 		
					so that He might fill all things.) 
		And He gave some 
			*as* apostles, 
		and some 		
			*as* prophets, 
		and some 		
			*as* evangelists, 
		and some 		
			*as* pastors and teachers, 
				for the equipping of the saints 
				for the work of service, 
				to the building up of the body of Christ; 
					until we all attain to the unity of the faith, 
					and of the knowledge of the Son of God, 
						to a mature man, 
							to the measure of the stature 
							which belongs to the fullness of Christ. 
As a result, 
	we are no longer to be children, 
		tossed here and there 
			by waves 
			and carried about 		
				by every wind of doctrine, 
				by the trickery of men, 
				by craftiness in deceitful scheming; 
			but speaking the truth in love, 
				we are to grow up in all *aspects* 				
					into Him 
						who is the head, 
							*even* Christ, 
								from whom the whole body, 
									being fitted 
									and held together 
									by what every joint supplies, 
										according to the proper 			
											working of each individual part, 
												causes the growth of the body 											
												for the building up of itself in love. 
```

## G. The Gentiles' Walk

```markdown
So this I say, 
	and affirm together with the Lord, 
		that you walk 	
#			no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, 
##				in the futility of their mind, 
##				being darkened in their understanding, 
##					excluded from the life of God 
##					because of the ignorance that is in them, 
##					because of the hardness of their heart; 
					and they, 				
						having become callous, 
						have given themselves over to sensuality 
							for the practice 
								of every kind of impurity 
									with greediness. 
```
## H. How Then?

```markdown
But you did not learn Christ in this way, 
					if indeed you have heard Him 
					and have been taught in Him, 
						just as truth is in Jesus, 
					that, in reference to your former manner of life, 
						you lay aside the old self, 
							which is being corrupted 						
							in accordance with the lusts of deceit, 
							and that you be renewed 						
							in the spirit of your mind, 
								and put on the new self, 
									which in *the likeness of* God 	
										has been created 
											in righteousness 
											and holiness 								
											of the truth. 
```

### Like this

```markdown
Therefore, 
	laying aside falsehood, 
		**speak** truth 	
			each one *of you* 	
			with his neighbor, 
				for we are members of one another. 
		Be **angry**, 
			and *yet* do not **sin**; 
			do not let the sun **go down** on your anger, 
			and do not **give** the devil an opportunity. 
				He who steals must **steal** no longer; 
					but rather he must **labor**, 
						performing with his own hands what is good, 
							so that he will have *something* to share 
								with one who has need. 
						Let no aunwholesome word **proceed** from your mouth, 
						but only such *a word* as is good for edification 
							according to the need *of the moment,* 
								so that it will give grace 				
									to those who hear. 
					Do not **grieve** the Holy Spirit of God, 
						by whom you were sealed 
							for the day of redemption. 
					Let all 			
						bitterness 
						and wrath 
						and anger 
						and clamor 
						and slander 
						be **put away** from you, 
					along with all malice. 
				**Be** kind to one another, 
					tender-hearted, 
						forgiving each other, 
							just as God 					
								in Christ 					
								also has forgiven you. 
						Therefore **be** imitators of God, 
							as beloved children; 
						and **walk** in love, 
							just as Christ 				
							also loved you 				
							and gave Himself up 				
							for us, 
								an offering 						
								and a sacrifice 						
								to God 						
									as a fragrant aroma. 
```

### Not like this

#### conduct
```markdown
But 
										immorality 
										or any impurity 
										or greed 
											must not even be **named** among you, 
												as is proper among saints; 
												and *there must be no* 
													filthiness 
													and silly talk, 
													or coarse jesting, 
													which are not fitting, 
													but rather giving of thanks. 
												For this **you know with certainty**, 
												that no 
														immoral 
														or impure person 
														or covetous man, 
														who is an idolater, 
														has an inheritance 		
														in the kingdom of Christ and God. 
```

#### conversatión														

```markdown
Let no one **deceive** you 
	with empty words, 
	for because of these things the wrath of God 
	comes upon the sons of disobedience. 
Therefore 
	do not **be** partakers with them; 
		for you were 
			formerly darkness, 
		but now you are 	
			Light in the Lord; 
			**walk** as children of Light 
				(for the fruit of the Light *consists* 
					in all goodness 
					and righteousness 
					and truth), 
						trying to learn 			
						what is pleasing to the Lord. 
				Do not **participate** 
					in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, 
						but instead even  **expose** them; 
							for it is disgraceful 
							even to speak of the things 
								which are done by them in secret. 
							But all things become visible 		
							when they are exposed by the light, 
							for everything that becomes visible is light. 
	For this reason it says, 
		“**Awake**, sleeper, 
		And **arise** from the dead, 
			And Christ will shine on you.” 
```

### Conclusion...by means of the Spirit

```markdown
Therefore 
	**be careful** how you walk, 
		not as unwise men but as wise, 
			making the most of your time, 
			because the days are evil. 
			So then do not **be** foolish, 
			but **understand** what the will of the Lord is. 
		And do not **get drunk** with wine, 
			for that is dissipation, 
				but be **filled** with the Spirit, 
					speaking to one another 
						in psalms 
						and hymns 
						and spiritual songs, 
						singing 
						and making melody 
							with your heart 
								to the Lord; 
									always giving thanks 	
										for all things 
										in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ 
											to God, 
												even the Father; 
														and be subject 
																to one another 
																	in the fear of Christ. 
```
#### 1. Wives

```markdown
# Wives, 
	*be subject* to your own husbands, 
		as to the Lord. 
			For the husband is the head of the wife, 
				as Christ also is the head of the church, 
						He Himself 
							*being* the Savior of the body. 
					But as the church is subject to Christ, 
						so also the wives 				
						*ought to be* to their husbands 
							in everything. 
```
#### 2. Husbands

```markdown
# Husbands, 
	**love** your wives, 
		just as Christ also 	
		loved the church 	
			and gave Himself up 	
				for her, 
				so that He might sanctify her, 
				having cleansed her 
				by the washing of water 
					with the word, 
					that He might present 
						to Himself the church 		
						in all her glory, 
							having 					
								no spot 							
								or wrinkle 								
								or any such thing; 
						but that she would be 
							holy 
							and blameless. 
		So husbands 
			ought also to love their own wives 
				as their own bodies. 
				He who loves his own wife 			
				loves himself; 
					for no one ever hated his own flesh, 
					but nourishes 			
					and cherishes it, 
						just as Christ also *does* the church, 
							because we are members of His body. 
						For this reason 			
							a man shall leave his father and mother 
								and shall be joined to his wife, 
								and the two shall become one flesh. 
This mystery is great; 
	but I am speaking with reference 
		to Christ 	
		and the church. 
	Nevertheless, 
	each individual among you 
		also is to **love** his own wife 
		even as himself, 
	and the wife 
		must *see to it* 
		that she respects her husband. 
```

#### 3. Children

```markdown
# Children, 
	**obey** your parents 
		in the Lord, 
		for this is right. 
	**Honor** your father and mother 
		(which is the first commandment with a promise), 
		so that it may be well with you, 
		and that you may live long on the earth. 
```
#### 4. Fathers
```markdown
# Fathers, 
	do not **provoke** your children **to anger**, 
	but **bring** them up 
		in the discipline 
		and instruction 
		of the Lord. 
```
#### 5. Slaves

```markdown
# Slaves, 
	be **obedient** to those 
		who are your masters 
			according to the flesh, 
			with fear and trembling, 
				in the sincerity of your heart, 
					as to Christ; 
						not by way of eyeservice, 
						as men-pleasers, 
						but as slaves of Christ, 
							doing the will of God 							
							from the heart. 
						With good will render service, 
							as to the Lord, 
							and not to men, 
								knowing that 								
									whatever good thing each one does, 
										this he will receive back 		
										from the Lord, 
											whether slave or free. 
```

#### 6. Masters
```markdown
# And masters, 
	**do** the same things to them, 
	and give up threatening, 
	knowing that both 
		their Master 
		and yours is in heaven, 
			and there is no partiality with Him. 
```
## I. Amor of God
```markdown
Finally, 
	be **strong** 
		in the Lord 
	and in the strength 
		of His might. 
	**Put on** the full armor of God, 
		so that you will be able to stand firm 
			against the schemes of the devil. 
		For our struggle is not against 
			flesh 
			and blood, 
				but 		
					against the rulers, 
					against the powers, 
					against the world forces of this darkness, 
					against the spiritual *forces* of wickedness 
					in the heavenly *places.* 
Therefore, 
	**take up** 
		the full armor of God, 
		so that you will be able to resist 
			in the evil day, 
		and having done everything, 
			to stand firm. 
	**Stand** firm therefore, 
		having girded your loins 
			with truth, 
		and having put on 
			the breastplate of righteousness, 
		and having shod your feet 
			with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 
in addition to all, 
	taking up the shield of faith 
		with which you will be able 
		to extinguish all 
		the flaming arrows of the evil *one.* 
	And **take** the helmet of salvation, 
	and the sword of the Spirit, 
		which is the word of God. 
```
## J. Prayer Requested
```markdown
With all prayer and petition pray at all times 
		in the Spirit, 
	and with this in view, 
		be on the alert 
			with all perseverance 
			and petition 
				for all the saints, 
		and *pray* on my behalf, 
			that utterance may be given to me 
				in the opening of my mouth, 
					to make known 
					with boldness 	
					the mystery of the gospel, 
						for which I am an ambassador 
						in chains; 
						that in *proclaiming* it I may speak boldly, 
							as I ought to speak. 
						But that you also may know about my circumstances, 
							how I am doing, 
```
