**Zechariah** 
 **Return to Me!**

**A prodigal nation comes home**

*Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time*



 

Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be...for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15 

We know there are certain books in the Bible that are not as popular as others. Quite possibly however, the most underestimated of them all lies tucked away between the major prophets and the gospels. It lies quietly, just waiting to be explored. 

That has been our experience as we have visited the book of Zechariah.  We spent countless hours in the presence of Zechariah, allow him to speak for himself and allow the Holy Spirit’s teaching to grant us understanding into what the most Messianic, most apocalyptic and most eschatological book in the Old Testament may well be. As if that was not enough, the main thread joining the book is a true story of love, deep with affections that Yahweh Sabaoth has for a wayward people and how they respond to Hi

 

There is no telling what God might reveal to you about Himself and His affections towards you in this short book! May God use this study to grow you deeper in your understanding of the affections God has prepared for you. Our prayer is that you as you walk with Zechariah through this epic narrative, you’ll come to see Judah’s need for Him, God’s solution for them and the ultimate reunion of reunions when at last they return with all their heart to the Lord! 

 

The illustrations Zechariah brings out in this book are enlightening and convicting! He has a list of appropriate examples from among the people to help show the reality of their spiritual condition. Returnees who never returned, people who mourned without knowing why, a high priest before God in filthy clothes, fleecing shepherd and blind sheep following a worthless shepherd, are only some of the illustrations contained in this little-known book. 

Zechariah is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out and some of the details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.

The narrative of Zechariah shows how God tirelessly protects His nation form extinction while she (also tirelessly) commits spiritual adultery with the gods of the nations. God is greater than the greatest evil. His plans are from everlasting. He provisioned the means, by giving His own son, so that she can be redeemed and forgiven. However, when His Son came, she decided she did not like him and has Him crucified. Zechariah makes it clear, God’s offer still stands…*return to me*…*I will return* (come again) *to you*!

You are about to embark on the magnificent account of the ages of a prodigal nation who wanders endlessly and of a loving Father who waits tirelessly until his son, yes, his dear son, comes home at last. This book is bound to encourage you as it was intended for the generation of Zechariah, to a real, intimate fellowship with God. 

God reveals His will, He calls people back to Himself and provides the way for their coming, and He promises that if they return to Him, He will return to them.

# The Background of Zechariah

## Historical setting

### Along with Haggai and Malachi, Zechariah is a **post**-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C. 

#### After being exiled for 70 years, Jews began returned to the land in 538b.C. Psalm 126:1‑6

#### Why were they exiled for a period of 70 years? 

##### God commanded Israel to rest the land. Every seven years the people were to trust God to provide while they rested the land. Since they did not trust the Lord, they kept farming the land even on the seventh year...they did not rest every seventh year for 70 years. Leviticus 26:34-35, 2 Chronicles 36:21

###### They had been in the Promised Land for roughly 800 years, but for 490 years, they disobeyed his Sabbath rest.

##### There will three returns to the land. 

##### 538 b.C. – Lead by Zerubbabel (Zechariah’s group)

##### 530 b.C. - Lead by Ezra 

##### 445 b.C. – Lead by Nehemiah - 

#### In 539 b.C. Cyrus the Persian conquered the Babylonians and in 538b.C. issued a decree for the Jews to be allowed to go back to Judah and gave order to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. 2 Chronicles 36:22-23, Ezra 5:13, 6:3

###### The prophet Isaiah had said 150 years before…*It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'*" Isaiah 44:28, Ezra 1:1-2, 7-8, 3:7, 5:13-17, 6:14, Isaiah 45:1

####  Zerubbabel was **placed** in charge as governor and was given finances for the rebuilding of the temple. Ezra 3:7-8

### Upon first arriving, people seeing the site of the first temple, gave offerings for it to be rebuilt. Ezra 2, 2:68-69

#### The Jews first went to their own cities. Ezra 2:70

### On the first day of the seventh month, the priests and their brothers along with Zerubbabel and his brothers came together with all the people in Jerusalem and repaired the **altar** on its foundation and renewed the daily sacrifices. Ezra 3:1-7

### Upon the second year of their return, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple and when it was completed, a great inaugural service was held praising God for his lovingkindness. Ezra 3:8-11

#### This caused a lot of interest in the Samaritans to the north of Judah (*the people beyond the river*). They wanted to help **rebuild** the temple. Ezra 4:1-2

##### However, their help was refused because they had syncretized their fear of God with pagan religions. Ezra 4:3, 2 Kings 17:33, 41

#### When the builders refused their help, they proceeded to make all sorts of **trouble**. They discouraged and frightened the people of Judah from continuing to build. Ezra 4:4

##### The Samaritans (*the people of the land*) hired advisors to frustrate their efforts during the days of Cyrus, all the way into the reign of Darius. Ezra 4:5

###### The *leaders of the land* and the rest of the nations that lived in Samaria and the neighbourinig area got behind these efforts, and together they issued a letter to king Artaxerxes. Ezra 4:7

###### The king responded their letter commanding the leaders issue a decree prohibiting the rebuilding of the city. They set up armed guards to stop any buidling activity. Ezra 4:23-24

### After about 16 years of their arrival, Haggai and Zechariah's prophetic ministries began. By faith, in accordance with God’s command, Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest, along with the prophets, began to build the temple. Ezra 5:1-2

#### Once again, the leaders of the land tried to oppose them. However, God allowed the people to continue until communication was made with king Darius. Ezra 5:3-17

##### Cyrus’ decree to go back and rebuild was **lost** and the current king, Darius I, had to search through years of records to verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12

#### When king Darius I found Cyrus's original **decree**, he immediately ordered to allow the rebuilding to continue. Ezra 6:1-5 

#### Darius commanded the governor of Samaria to not only leave the rebuilding of the temple, but for the full cost of the temple to be paid out of the treasury of the taxes of Samaria without delay. Ezra 6:8-12

##### It would be four years before the Jews would successfully finish the building. Ezra 6:14-22

## The direct audience of Zechariah 

### The book of Zechariah was written to Jews who came to the land after having left it completely desolate for 70 years. 

#### While some of the older generation did survive the 70 years, most of the people were born in Babylon and had never seen Judah, Jerusalem or the temple before. 

##### 42,360 people returned to Judah on this first wave, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred **singers**. Included in this group were members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2, Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70 

#### Zechariah has a secondary audience among the Jews who would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He **chose** to make unconditional promises to Abraham. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally to the people who turn to Him by faith. Genesis 12:1-3

##### Therefore, the contents of the book of Zechariah are still playing out today and will serve as a strong witness during the days of the Tribulation when God once again begins working his program with Israel. Zechariah 12-14, 12:10

## Writing style      

### 2 major divisions

#### Chapters 1-8 are dated specifically, and author is stated (quoted mostly in Revelation)

#### Chapters 9-14 are undated, and no author stated (quoted mostly in the Gospels)

#### Other prophets had the same style of division in half

##### Isaiah 1-39 and 40-66, 

##### Ezekiel 1-39 and 40-48 

##### Daniel 1-6 and 7-12

### Genre

#### Zechariah is an example of apocalyptic literature. It contains mostly prose, and poetry   

##### Zechariah 1-8 are prose except for Zechariah 2:6-13.

##### Zechariah 9-14 are poetry (Zechariah 9:2-11:14, 17, 13:7-9)

###### According to some ancient manuscripts, Zechariah was also a poet. His name is in the titles of: Psalm 137, 145— 50 in the LXX [Septuagint], Psalm 111, 145 in the Vulgate; Psalm 125, 145—48 in the Syriac." [[1\]](#_ftn1)

###### 515b.C. Note: This Psalm [145 in LXX], and the four following, which end the book, are supposed to have been sung at the dedication of the second temple... [[2\]](#_ftn2)

#### The variety of Scriptural genres and structures implies a creative element on the part of the human author. [[3\]](#_ftn3)

## Why study the book of Zechariah?   

### Jerome calls Zechariah the most obscure book in the OT. Yet, it is alluded to extensively in the New Testament. We should understand why authors like the Gospel writers, Peter and others quoted it. 

### Though Israel is never merged or likened with the Church and the Church has never replaced Israel, Zechariah teaches the faithfulness of God as He is bound to His word to keep it. 

### It is a message filled with admonishment, encouragement, exhortation, **hope** and restoration. 

#### It was because of the prophecies of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the **temple** restarted and completed four years later. Ezra 6:14

### Zechariah contains a forward pointing view of the Gospel that can easily be understood from our point in time, giving the book a highly Evangelistic message for Gentiles as well as to those with a Jewish mindset. 

### The New Testament **quotes** or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times. 

#### Not only does it **unfold** prophetic details, but it also allows us insight into behind-the-scenes spiritual warfar

### It **shows** how God is in control and never forgets his promises. 

### Most importantly, it **reveals** to us the person of Messiah. Zechariah dwells on the Person and the work of Christ more fully than all the minor prophets put together. Revelation 19:10

#### It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father **prior** to his first coming. 

#### It shows us His nature during his first coming and finally his galant **entry** and conquest on his second return as conquering king. 

## Why don’t more people study Zechariah?  

### Because it’s seldom taught as it presents the interpreter with difficulties. Since teachers don’t teach it, people aren’t interested to want to study it. 

### People who have read through Zechariah will say it is cryptic, confusing and difficult to understand. 

#### The visions are full of symbolism

#### There doesn’t seem to be any set theme that flows throughout.

#### Chapters 1-8 seem disconnected from chapters 9-14

### While there are difficulties in studying the book of Zechariah, the message that can be clearly understood far outweighs any difficulties. 

#### One thing that will aid our understanding is knowing the promises of the future have nothing to do with returning from Babylon, since that had already occurred about 14 years prior. 

### It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological map of the **future** but rather to present to us the grand scheme of Israel’s future as fulfilled in Messiah-the very purpose of prophecy. Zechariah contains the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God's plan of restoration. 

#### “The prophecy of Zechariah is to the Old Testament what the book of Revelation is to the New. It is the apocalypse of the Old Testament which portrays God’s future dealings with His chosen people Israel . . . The book of Zechariah, especially chapter 14, stands as a continual corrective to all those theories which deny the literal, future restoration of Israel, after a period of chastening, in her own land, over whom the Messiah will reign in Zion”. [[4\]](#_ftn4)

### The book of Zechariah shows **how** God works when His people stray, always calling them back to Himself.

#### Zechariah contains teaching that reveals a wayward heart and how to return to God. 

### All the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God's Messiah, Christ the Lord and how it is that the people need to return to Him. 

## Before we continue…

### We would encourage you to take a minute before going on to ask God to unveil the contents of this book. Allow yourself to be teachable, the Holy Spirit Himself is the author behind Zechariah and He will guide you in all truth. 

### The divisions of the book are often presented as 8-4-2. That is, 8 visions, 4 messages and 2 burdens. Though that is true, the main thrust of the book is contained in 1 message, “return to me” which is presented as an introductory message and often ignored. Therefore we suggest that the divisions be understood as 1-8-4-2 with the first being the principal guide and theme for unlocking the book. 

# Zechariah 1:1-6 - The First Message – Theme of the book

## Zechariah 1:1-2 Setting and Author

### Zechariah 1:1a *In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,…* This is Darius I (Darius the Great) son of Darius Hystaspes who reigned from 29th of September 522 b.C. to October 486 b.C.. 

#### The dating given is according to a Gentile king. This is because no Jewish king was reigning, and the "*Times of the Gentiles*" is underway. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24, Mark 13:14

##### Zerubbabel is the governor of Judah under the Medo-Persian empire. 

###### Judah was overthrown by **Babylon** and taken into captivity. When they returned, they were subject to the whims of the Medo-Persians. Even though Zerubbabel was in the direct line of David, he was not king. This confirms Coniah's curse. Luke 3:27, Matthew 1:12, Jeremiah 22:30

#### Zechariah was written as four messages. 

##### The first message of the book was written in the eighth month of 520 b.C., Zechariah 1:1

##### The second message was written three months later. Zechariah 1:7

##### The third message was written in 518 b.C. Zechariah 7:1

##### No dating is given for the fourth message found in chapters 9 through 14 but it appears to have been written at a later date and under different circumstances.

#### The whole book is written from and is regarding the city of Jerusalem. What changes is the time. Some have suggested the following timeframe. 

##### Chapters 1-8 Jerusalem under Medo-Persian rule (586-332 b.C.)

##### Chapters 9-10 Jerusalem governed by Greece (332-63 b.C.)

##### Chapter 11 Jerusalem under Roman domination (63 b.C.-70 A.D.f)

##### Chapters 12 to 14 Jerusalem's last days of national history

####  The future promises for Israel contained in this short book serve to provide a record throughout the ages as encouragement to Israel to return to Yahweh Shabaot. Every generation of Jew for over 2500 years has had, in the record of Zechariah, a faithful testimony of Yahweh interacting with her throughout the ages to bring about her yet future return. 

####  One day, in the not-so-distant future, Zechariah's book will find it's total fulfillment in a literal way and "*all will know that I am the Lord*". 

### Zechariah 1:1b *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,…* It was the word of the Lord, not Zechariah's imagined word. This was the word of the Lord the moment it was receive

#### Zechariah did not become the word of the Lord when it was included in the canon of Scripture. 

#### It was, is and will continue to be God’s word. 

#### Zechariah was a prophet. This was his role. He received messages from the Lord and relayed them to the people. 

### Zechariah was of the tribe of **Levi**. His name means "Yahweh remembers". Nehemiah 12:1, 16 

#### Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah was both prophet and **priest**. 

##### Zechariah became a head of his own division of priests during the time of Joiakim, the son of Joshua. Nehemiah 12:12, 16 

#### In the beginning of his ministry, Zechariah was probably a **young** man and was born in Babylon. Zechariah 2:4

##### Zechariah's contemporary, Haggai, began his ministry in September of 520 b.C. as well. While Haggai's focus was to rebuild the temple, Zechariah's prophecy complemented his ministry focusing on a spiritual return to the Lord. 

##### While Haggai's focus is more on things past and present, the message given to Zechariah will reach far into the future, relating to the returning generation of a wonderfully restored Jewish nation back in fellowship with Almighty God. 

### Zechariah 1:1c *the son of Berechiah,…*Berechiah was Zechariah's father. Not much is known about Berechiah except that his **name** means "Yahweh blesses". Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra among the returnees. 

#### Jesus makes a statement about Berechiah's son, Zechariah being martyred. Matthew 23:35 

##### There are differing opinions regarding Jesus mentioning Berechiah. 

###### Option 1: Jehoiada means the same as Berechiah. There was another prophet Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was martyred. Since both father's names essentially mean the **same** thing, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus. 2 Chronicles 24:20-22 

###### Option 2: A copyist error. Some suggest it could be a copyists's **error** in the transcription of the Greek text.

###### Option 3: Though this tragedy was done in secret, Jesus confesses having witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah's **murder**, just the same as he did Abel's, which was also done in secret. This seems the most plausible option of the three. 

###### If this is true, and we believe it is, it is not recorded anywhere in Scripture. That, however, does not make it false. 

###### Matthew seemed familiar with the book of Zechariah – he quotes it at least three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus **mention** this event, so he brings this detail out where the other Gospel writers do not. 

##### In the context of Matthew, Jesus seems to be alluding to the first and last of the righteous prophets of the Old Testament. To say that Zechariah son of Jehoiada was the last would exclude many prophets (including Zechariah) as righteous. 

###### God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He **sees** all that is done in public as well as in secret. Ultimately, he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20

###### Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also says that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. These **rabbis** would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus. 

### Zechariah 1:1d *the son of Iddo…* Iddo is Zechariah's grandfather. His **name** means "appointed time". 

#### Iddo was a priest. Iddo is **listed** among those who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 12:4, 12:16

##### Zechariah is also referred to as the **son** of Iddo. This was common and similar calling him forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14 

###### Ezra speaks of prophet Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. Perhaps the Zechariah’s role of priest became prominent and is what Ezra brings out. 

### Together, the names Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say, "*Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time*". The harmonizes wonderfully with the message of the book. When the appointed **time** comes, God will fulfill all His promises and they will be carried out with overflowing blessing. 

## Zechariah 1:2-3 The great appeal, "*return to Me and I will return to you*"

### Zechariah 1:2a *"The LORD was very angry with your fathers…* the **fathers** are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36

#### The pre-exilic fathers are used as an example of what not to do. It was their refusal to listen that sent the nation into exile for 70 years. 

#### Zechariah 1:2b *...Very angry* literally says angry with **anger**. 

### Zechariah 1:3b *"Therefore say to them Thus says the LORD of hosts*... Zechariah's primary audience are the **people** who have returned from exile in Babylon. Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts' **word** to the people. 

#### This included the few older generation, the ones born in Babylon and specifically mentioned are Zerubbabel and Joshua. 

#### What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God's **word**. Zechariah 1:7, 1:7, 4:6, 4:8, 6:9, 7:1, 7:4, 7:8, 8:1, 8:18, 9:1, 11:11, 12:1

##### God spoke through the prophets. Hebrews 1:1, 

##### God’s word is inspired (carried) by the Holy Spirit. 2 Timothy 3:16-17

##### When God speaks something, He is **tied** to His word to fulfill it. Ezra 1:1, Proverbs 30:5, Hebrews 6:17-18, 

### *The Lord of Hosts…*who is the Lord of Hosts? 

#### In Hebrew it is Yahweh Sabaoth sometimes translated Almighty of **armies**. It appears 235 times in the Bible

##### The first time this name of God appears in the Bible is in 1 Samuel when the people of Israel were concerned about armies, particularly the Philistine armies. 

###### The name appears often in prophetical books. 

#### *The Lord of Hosts* is mentioned no less than 53 times in Zechariah. Therefore, in order to better understand it, we should get better acquainted with this name for God. Luke 2:13, Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psalm 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53

#### The Lord of Hosts is the **Commander of Armies**

##### Isaiah 13:4 *...is mustering the **army** for battle.* Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, **Isaiah** 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3, 1 Kings 22:19 

##### Isaiah 19:16 *...Awake to punish all the **nations**...* Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7

##### Nahum 2:13 "*Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will **burn** up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.*" Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3; Psalm 103:20-21; Matthew 13:41, 24:30-31; Revelation 19:11-20

##### David was familiar with the meaning of the Lord of hosts. He **invoked** the Lord of Hosts when going to battle with Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10

###### Though David took off Saul's **armor**, he put on the Lord of Hosts. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27 

####  The Lord of Hosts is the **King**:

##### Psalm 24:10 *Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah*. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19, 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14

##### Isaiah 9:7 *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over **his kingdom**, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.*

##### When Christ is seated on His **throne**, He will be called *the Lord of Hosts*. Zechariah 14:16-17 

####  The Lord of Hosts is the **Redeemer**:

##### Isaiah 47:4 ***Our Redeemer\****, the LORD of HOSTS...*

##### Isaiah 44:6 "*...the King of Israel and **his Redeemer**, the LORD of hosts...* Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5

####  The Lord of Hosts is **Holy**:

##### Isaiah 6:3 "*Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts...*" Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16

####  The Lord of Hosts is **Almighty**:

##### Daniel 4:35 *"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN & among the inhabitants of earth & no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, 'What have You done?"* 

#### The Lord of Hosts and the **Davidic** Covenant...

##### 2 Samuel 7:27 *"For You, O LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have made a revelation to Your servant, saying, '**I will build you a house**';...*

##### It is the Lord of **Hosts** who will ultimately will avenge the injustice done to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8

##### As the prophets used this title, they stressed Yahweh's sovereignty in action, not just in its abstract meaning. That is, they saw Yahweh Sabaoth as leading all armies—armies of stars, angels, and people. 

###### Zechariah lived when Israel had lost its army, had no military power, had little political organization, and no political power. Thus, by referring to Yahweh as "*the LORD of armies*," Zechariah was reminding his hearers of their God's abiding and active sovereignty.[[5\]](#_ftn5)

###### God is the Lord of the stars, the powers of heaven, and all the forces of the universe - a most inclusive and comprehensive name for God. [[6\]](#_ftn6)

#### The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in the aspect of God that God stressed in revealing Himself to His people through its writer. Zechariah used the name *Yahweh Sabaoth* more than any other book of the Bible. 

##### Zechariah's message **comes** directly from the Lord of hosts himself..."*thus says the Lord of hosts*" Psalm 84:1-12 

### Zechariah 1:3c "*Thus says the Lord of hosts...Return to Me,...*" The Lord Almighty, Lord of the armies, says this..."come back to Me". 

### While Haggai is more focused on the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah's message is to encourage the people to return into **right** relationship with God. 

#### They had come back from exile, but they needed to turn fully and trustingly to the Lord. 

### Some are offended at the idea that God's sovereignty would be affected if man had any say in the matter. Yet clearly in this circumstance we have the Lord of Hosts Himself inviting His nation to willingly "*return to Me*". It would be hypocritical of God to call to a return and force them to do so. 

##### God sovereignly chooses to limit Himself sovereignly allows man to respond to His invitation at will. God is looking for free responses, not forced gestures. Zechariah proves this. 

##### God makes the invitation and leaves it up to man to respond. He makes it a point to draw all of mankind to Himself. John 12:32, 48

##### Zechariah tells us is that God is faithful to His word. He will patiently hold back the wonderful promises made to Israel until she returns in belief. Romans 11:23, Zechariah 12:10

###### All of God's promises to withhold blessings will be kept. Zechariah shows this.

###### All of God's promises to return to them when they return to Him will also be kept. Zechariah describes this. 

##### In the meantime, God protects Israel from annihilation (you can't keep a promise to a nation that doesn't exist), keeping the gentile nations at bay until that wondrous day when she returns to Him with all her heart. 

###### Romans 11:33 *Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways!*

#### The returning Jews needed to understand that merely returning to the land, reinhabiting Jerusalem, rebuilding the temple is not synonymous with **placing** their confidence in the Lord of Hosts. 1 John 3:3

##### Zephaniah 3:1 *Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!*

##### Zephaniah 3:2 *She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; **she trusted not in the LORD**; she drew not near to her God.*

#### The opposite of returning is to **forsake**. When they didn't trust the Lord, they were completely forsaking the Lord of hosts. They kept the law in part and placed their trust in idolatry, wealth and even their religious form. Not trusting the Lord and serving other gods is called "doing evil". Deuteronomy 4:25, 17:2-5

### Zechariah 1:3d *declares the LORD of hosts,…* This is a declaration from the Lord. It is probable Zechariah preached this message to all the people. 

#### One might think this exhortation is really uncalled for at a time like this. The people had just gone through a time of discipline where God took them away from the land into a strange land to live among a strange, pagan people who did not have the same practices and customs as they did. 

##### Surely they didn't need exhorting to return to the Lord? The Lord seemed to think they did. That was enough for Zechariah and it should be enough for us when we are exhorted by the Lord. 

##### A new generation was now coming back to the **land**, They had left their exilic homes, and reistablished the daily sacrifices. The foundation for the temple was even laid. Things were seemingly going well, Did the prophet not understand how much they had already sacrificed? Wasn't God pleased with them? 

###### God is more interested for their hearts to be **tuned** to Him, instead of all their hard efforts for Him. The Jews needed first of all to return to Him spiritually. This vital aspect of their return was totally overlooked and taken for granted due to the circumstances. 

##### When the trials of the building project come their way, they were quickly discouraged and frustrated. They had not been **trusting** the Lord of hosts for His daily spiritual provision in their lives, how could they trust God for the rebuilding of the temple? Haggai 1:9-11 

### Zechariah 1:1 *"that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts...* What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side but even greater, is to have him with you. 

#### The tabernacle in the middle of the nation was to serve as a reminder of God's **presence** among the people. 

##### The Lord is not just saying "I'm going to bless you", He's essentially saying, "I'm going to **dwell** with you". I will cohabit with you. I will share my heart with you. Exodus 25:8, Exodus 29:46, 2 Corinthians 6:6

##### In the Church age, God enters (indwells) the believer through the Person of the Holy Spirit. Yet it is only as we turn to Him or rather, in New Testament vernacular, walk with Him by faith that He richly **dwells** in us. Acts 17:24, Ephesians 3:17, Colossians 3:16

##### In the Millennial age, all of Israel will be given hearts that love God and God dwells in the midst of His people. 2 Corinthians 6:16, Ezekiel 36:26

## Zechariah 1:4-6 Their fathers returned but never returned to the Lord

### In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will clarify what "*return to Me*" does not **not** mean. 

#### Zechariah 1:4a *"Do **not** be like your fathers,…* Look to your fathers' example, don't follow in their footsteps, do **not** follow their example. 2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8 

#### Zechariah 1:4b *to whom the former prophets proclaimed,…* God had spoken to them through the prophets. In fact, they had been **warned** countless times and in countless ways. 

##### The former prophets include; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, **Joel**, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10 

#### Zechariah 1:4c saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now...(to Me) Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10

##### It was not the Lord that needed to return to them first, it was the people that had departed from the Lord and needed to realize their state, change their minds and return to Him. 

##### This is not simply to a formal obedience to His law and covenant. Zechariah was to warn the Israelites not to be like their (pre-exilic) forefathers who refused to respond to the preaching of earlier (pre-exilic) prophets.

##### This is not saying if Israel would have ceased from sinning, God would have returned. A return to God is not synonymous with sinning less as some teach. 

##### A return meant coming to God without delay on the basis of who He is and His promised Provision for sin's atonement in the coming Messiah. 

####  Zechariah 1:4c *...from your evil ways and from your evil deeds…"'* The fathers, just like Zechariah's generation, needed to change their minds away from what they trusted in, **towards** God. Acts 20:21

####  Zechariah 1:4d *..evil ways and from evil deeds...*The evidence is conclusive. Their ways and deeds demonstrated the condition of their wayward hearts. Ezekiel 14:5

###### This may sound like the Lord is saying to stop their evil ways and evil deeds. They should, but that is not the point here. 

###### The point is to convince the people their ways and deeds were a result of a bad relationship with God. Jeremiah 2:13

##### Zechariah's admonishment to his generation is that they learn from the bad example of their forefathers and listen to what the Lord had to say and return to Him. Jeremiah 29:13, Proverbs 3:5, 1 Samuel 12:24

###### The message contained in this book is intended to do exactly that to the returnees. This is true of subsequent generations as well. 

####  Zechariah 1:4d *But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD.…* The real issue resided in the hearts. They did not listen...Isaiah 6:10

####  They were unable to hear God speaking because they didn't listen. They were rebellious and refused to **heed** the many warnings. Jeremiah 17:23, 29:19, 35:17, 44:5

##### Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place. A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil **things** but a return to fellowship. 

###### A **return** to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 2 Chronicles 12:14

##### God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious **rote**. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27, Colossians 2:23 

##### God hates religious rote as a replacement for a **relationship**. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4

###### It is counted as **violence** to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4

###### In Acts 17:22 Paul says these **words** about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. *So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects*. Jeremiah 10:2, Acts 28:3-4, Acts 17:23

##### This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. They arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be **rebuilt** . Haggai 1:2

###### Once again, God disciplined them, this time with a **drought** yet they still did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17

#### Zechariah 1:5a *"Your fathers, where are they?…* While a small group of them returned, the **fathers** for the most part had been killed by the Babylonians and died off or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10

#### Zechariah 1:5b *And the prophets, do they live forever?…* The prophets were human too and eventually died. Some prophets were **killed** by the very people they prophecied to.

##### God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, 

##### God's offer of **salvation** is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2

#### Zechariah 1:6a *"But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,…* God raised up prophets to speak His words and His statutes were written down so there would be no mistaking what God said. 

###### *My words...*The prophet who spoke presumptuously without the Lord commanding Him should not be feared. Deuteronomy 18:18-22, Jeremiah 28:15-17, Deuteronomy 13:5

###### *My statues...*These were God given through Moses, and written down. Israel was not to add or take away from them. Deuteronomy 4:1-2, 8

#### Zechariah 1:6b *overtake your fathers?…* The words spoken through His servants and the established statutes came to pass as God had said they would. Deuteronomy 28:45

#### Zechariah 1:6c *...and they returned and said...* (KJV) the word returned (SHUB) is correctly translated "*returned*" in the King James version, and not as the New American Standard Version. It's referring to a physical return from Babylon to the land. Compare the use of **SHUB** in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6

#### Zechariah 1:6d *As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.…* The forefathers served to testify of the veracity of God's word. Their witness is clear, God did as He said He would do. Lamentations 1:18, 2:7 

###### The first temple was destroyed in 586b.C. and the second temple was finished in 516b.C., a gap of 70 years. 

###### The first deportation was in 605b.C. while the first return occured in 536b.C., a 70 year gap. 

##### The returnees were now hearing the word of the Lord through the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. The statutes continued to speak the same and now the forefathers testimony as well, gave credence to the importance of heeding the message. 

##### Though a group returned physically, their focus was on the land, the temple and on material blessings. Blessings removed and curses received. Yet they never repented, they never changed their minds from trusting themselves to trusting God. 

###### Jeremiah 7:4 *"Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.'* Jeremiah 7:8

###### This has been referred to as “walking at a guilty distance.” This is not what it means to walk with God. Genesis 6:9 

#### A note about biblical repentance 

##### The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct **response** to the Gospel. 

##### In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe based his translation on Jerome's Latin Bible as his sole source. The **Latin** vulgate unfortunately had several grave mistranslations, including the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. 

##### The doctrine of penance was what was being **taught** by the Roman Church, which required the sinner paying a certain penance in order to be forgiven. 

##### The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel profound sorrow, be penitent) replaced the original **Greek** word metanoia (change your mind). 

##### We can understand then why sometimes the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) is translated to repent when it was much **clearer** to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned. Spiritually they did not. 

###### In this case, the fathers recognized being wrong and that God was punishing them for disobedience. They readily accepted the consequences of their sin (punishment). 

###### Yet they never looked to God. They recognized God as sovereign and the punishment they deserved but their trust was never placed in the Lord. They trusted in fate. Their hope was that God somehow might show mercy on them despite their wrong doings. 

##### This is the **wrong** attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. 

###### As the believer fellowships with God, God brings certain things (sin) to light which the believer should confess it to (agree with) God. Yet the **basis** for fellowship is not confession. 

###### Confession does not access or maintain fellowship, faith does. Confession is what results of repentance (a change of mind) while walking by faith in fellowship with God. *He who says he has no sin...lies and is not fellowshipping with God.* 1 John 1

###### If one has to confess to get back into fellowship with God, the waters of grace are muddied. It is displaced sufficiency of Christ onto the actions of the believer. 

###### More to the point, the people who came to John the Baptist confessing their sin, were believers who were responding to the preaching of repentance. John's baptism was an appropriate response of what God was doing in the hearts of the people through John's message. Mark 1:1-4, Matthew 3:7-8

#### In like manner, the believer is to confess his sins because his sins have been forgiven. It is not for forgiveness that he confesses, but because he accepts by faith he already has forgiveness. This is aligning, saying the same, to what God says in His word. 

##### Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the **payment** for all sin not merely for sins that are confessed. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has fully paid for his sin debt (past, present, future) and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God. 

###### If a believer sins, a return to God (a believer who repents) is one who comes to God on the basis of who Christ is and his standing in Christ by faith and thereby providing acceptance before the Father. No amount of confession of sin makes the sinner more or less acceptable before the Father. That was Christ's work. Colossians 2:6

##### The Jewish forefathers needed approach God by faith. Merely **admitting** sin and accepting the consequences as from God, is not the same as approaching God by faith which requires resting in God's provision. Ezekiel 20:43 

###### We find a stark contrast between the fathers and Daniel's response when he read the prophecy of Jeremiah regarding the 70 year exile. Daniel 9:15-19

#### Biblical repentance is not merely admitting you're guilty, it's trusting God's solution. Matthew 27:3-5

#### Biblical repentance is not feeling **sorrow** for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. In fact, the Bible used two very different words for repent and sorrow. 

##### It is true that God's kindness or godly sorrow can lead to repentance but they are not one in the **same** thing, one leads to the other. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9

#### Biblical repentance is not ceasing from **sin**, promising not to sin or changing one's life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase "repent of your sins" is not found anywhere in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says "*repent **for** the forgiveness of sins*" which clearly shows sins being forgiven is a promised result of repentance. 

#### Biblical repentance not something you **measure** to see if it is real, true or authentic. This is a common misconception that still plagues Christianity today. 

#### The root is a change of mind which is internal. The results may or may not be outward and could be evidenced differently in each case but are not a requirement by God for the internal to be considered authentic. Luke 3:8-18 

##### Salvation is by faith in the Gospel. Salvation is not by works, lest any man should **boast**. Ephesians 2:8-9

#### Biblical repentance is changing one's **mind** towards God. You change your thinking from what you were trusting in to trust God alone. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1

##### In the case of an unbeliever, he or she must change their mind about God's offer made through the **Gospel** (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5

##### Or a believer in error should **repent** (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16

#### The purpose of this message was that God was warning the returning **Jews** that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not trust Him. 

###### They would be **prone** to imagine the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and return to Him by faith. Yet the fathers did not.

###### Isaiah 29:13-16 *Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And **honor** Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote* 

###### *Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the **wisdom** of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed."* 

###### *Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?" You turn things around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its **maker**, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?* 

###### James 4:8 “*Draw near to God and He will draw near to you*...”. 

#### Following are some examples from the people that Zechariah brings out throughout the book to demonstrate bad believing and their need to change their minds...

##### **The busy returnees** - for about 16 years the people stood by and concluded "it was not God's will" to rebuild the temple. They each went to building their elaborate homes. Haggai 1:2, 4, 8

##### **The unlistening fathers** - This lot persisted playing deaf with God and got deported. Zechariah 1:4-6

##### **The unmoved exiles** - The jews who remained in comfort, remaining dispersed in foreign nations. Zechariah 2

##### **The soiled high priest** - The priestly garments (ie Joshua's) was soiled. Satan didn't need any other incriminated evidence to bring a charge against God's elect. Clearly, they were guilty. Zechariah 3

##### **The temple whiners** - Since the second temple was not as grand as the first, they scorned the building of the second temple. Large or small, when God asks you to get involved it's a grand thing! Zechariah 4

##### **Wickedness in the land** - wickedness will have to be removed, why would God have to remove wickedness from the land of a people that "deserved" God's blessings? Zechariah 5

##### **The redundant mourners** - This lot mourned about their losses, only to forget the reason why they lost them in the first place. Zechariah 7-8

##### **The Good Shepherd rejectors** - God provided a Shepherd for Israel. He was caring, compassionate and protective of the flock, yet they rejected Him. Zechariah 9

##### **The fleecing shepherds** - The people tolerated shepherds who used them for financial gain. Zechariah 11:1-5

##### **Dishonest merchants** - These returnees learned Babylonian ways. They used lying and swearing to secure business. 

##### **The foolish shepherd followers** - The people readily embraced a foolish Shepherd who didn't care about them and didn't protect them. Instead they were slaughtered. Zechariah 11:15-17

##### **Those who pierced the Deliverer** - The infamous nation who killed their liberator. 

#### These illustrations serve to cause reflective consideration regarding the people's true spiritual condition. Would they see their utter need and return to Yahweh or continue on the same path as their fathers? 

# Zechariah 1:7-6:8 - The Second Message: Eight Visions

### Three months later, Zechariah received 8 visions in one **night**. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some parts were fulfilled within the near future but most of the prophecies contained in the visions have yet to be fulfilled even today. 

### These night visions **serve** the primary purpose of revealing to the people, God's involvement behind the scenes to make Israel and Judah's return to Him a reality. All of these visions deal with God's nation, Israel and not generally speaking of God's 'people'. 

### These visions serve to encourage the people of Zechariah's time to **finish** building the temple. The temple is important for so many reasons within the existence of the Jews but a key reason is so that prophecy regarding Messiah might be fulfilled.

### They also serve to give hope to future generations as the visions unveil how God is compassionately and faithfully fighting for Israel and of His **plans** to make Israel the epicenter of the world.

### We will try not to discifer **every** detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know. 

#### Each of the visions follow a similar pattern.

## Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the horseman

### **Zechariah 1:7-8 The Vision**

#### Zechariah 1:7a *On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month*, Three months after receiving the first message, Zechariah receives a second communication from the Lord. 

#### Zechariah 1:7b *which is the month Shebat*, Since Zechariah lives in a Persian/Babylonian/Hebrew culture, he gives the Aramaic month name as well. Shebat is the adapted Babylonian **name** for the eleventh month. 

##### This is January-February, the time of **year** when winter is on its way out in Israel. 

#### Zechariah 1:7c *in the second year of Darius*, Though Medo-Persia had years of trouble after Cyrus died, by his second year, Darius managed to bring the empire to stability and peace. 

##### "Darius boasted that in nineteen battles he had defeated nine rebel leaders and had subdued all his enemies. So the empire was again virtually quiet by 520 B.C."[[7\]](#_ftn7)

####  Zechariah 1:7d *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo,* again, Zechariah gives his credentials. This may have been because these were separate messages that were later compiled into one book of Zechariah's prophecies. 

##### This day (24 Shebat) marked 5 months since the rebuilding of the temple had begun. Haggai 1:14-15, 2:10, 18, 20

####  Zechariah 1:7-8a ...*as follows: I **saw** at night,* This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of **visions** in the night.

##### This was not a dream. Zechariah was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was **how** God many times communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6

####  Zechariah 1:8b *and behold, a man was riding*...This man is the only rider mentioned and appears to take a more prominent role. 

###### Who is this rider? We are later told he is the angel of the Lord. We will discuss this later in verse 11. 

####  Zechariah 1:8c *...on a red horse*, we cannot be dogmatic since the the angel does not say, but generally speaking **red** symbolizes bloodshed, many times as a result of war. 

##### Horses then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often **seen** in the context of war. Cavalry was highly regarded by many civilizations during this time. 

##### In Revelation 6:4 we also see a red **horse** who comes to take peace and cause war and bloodshed. 

#### Zechariah 1:8d *and he was standing among the myrtle trees* It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing **among** the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees. 

##### Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther's Hebrew **name** (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 

###### Myrtle branches are used during the celebration of the **Feast** of Booths. Nehemiah 8:15, Isaiah 41:19, 55:13

##### In the Millennial age, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into **myrtle** trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19

#### Zechariah 1:8e *which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.* Red, **sorrel** and white horses behind him. 

##### These horses probably symbolize angelic beings as they were God's representatives sent to "*patrol the earth*". 

##### Persian monarchs used messengers on swift steeds to keep them informed on all matters concerning their empire. [[8\]](#_ftn8)

### **Zechariah 1:9a The Question**

#### Zechariah 1:9a *Then I said, "My lord, what are these?"* Zechariah wants to **know** what it was that he saw. 

### **Zechariah 1:9b-17 The Interpretation**

#### Zechariah 1:9b *And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,"I will show you what these are."* It is not the receptor's task to **guess** what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1

#### Zechariah 1:10a *And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,* The man standing enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision...

#### Zechariah 1:10b *"These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.*" The horses here most likely represent angelic **beings** sent by the Lord. 

##### This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and **report** back to Him. Zechariah 6:7 

##### We know from Job 1:6-7 that angelic beings are roaming the **earth**. 

####  Zechariah 1:11a *So they answered the angel of the LORD* This is the **first** mention of "*the angel of the Lord*" in Zechariah. 

##### *The angel of the LORD* can be seen about 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article *the* helps **identify** He is a singular being. 

####  The only adequate interpretation for this being as seen here as well as other portions of Scripture, is that it is referring to the pre-incarnate Lord Jesus Christ. 

##### The angel of the Lord was the Lord Himself, the second person of the Trinity. 

##### This “*man among the myrtle trees*” appears to be the same as the **angel** of the Lord Zechariah 1:11–13

##### The Angel of the Lord shows up six times in **Zechariah**. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8

##### The angel of the Lord had an intercessory role throughout the Old Testament. Zechariah 1:12, 12:8, Exodus 14:19; 33:14; Isaiah 13:9; 1 Corinthians 10:4

###### The angel of the Lord removed Joshua the priest's filthy garments and gave him new clothes symbolizing the preparation for temple service before the Lord. 

##### The angel of the Lord is Yahweh but shown distinct from Yahweh in other passages. The following Scriptures illustrate how the writers showed the angel of the Lord to be Yahweh but yet distinct from Yahweh. 2 Samuel 24:16; Zechariah 1:12

###### He gives comfort to **Hagar**. Genesis 16:7, 11

###### He calls **Moses**. The angel of the Lord is Yahweh. Exodus 3:1-6

###### He stopped **Abraham** from sacrificing Isaac. Genesis 22:11-12, 15-16

###### To talk sense to **Balaam**. Numbers 22:31, 35, 38

###### To prepare **Gideon** for battle. Judges 6:12-13, 22 

###### **David** was terrified by His sword. 1 Chronicles 21:18, 27, 30

##### Genesis 3:15 tells us that God will raise up a deliverer, who is to be a man, born of the woman who will crush Satan. 

##### Zechariah reveals to us something more about the angel of the Lord. 

###### He mentions twice in this passage that He is a man. Zechariah 1:8, 10

###### He removes iniquity. Zechariah 3:1, 4

##### Did Zechariah see Jesus in the future? Or perhaps he actually saw the angel of the Lord before he put on humanity but was identifying 

##### Zechariah states twice that the angel of the Lord is a standing. Zechariah 1:8, 10 

###### Stephen saw Jesus standing when he was being stoned. Acts 7:55-56

###### Jesus is seen standing when he receives the scroll in Heaven. Revelation 5:6

###### Jesus will be seen standing on mount Zion when He returns. Revelation 14:1

####  We therefore conclude that according to Zechariah and supportive Scriptures that the identity of the Angel of the Lord (capitalized from now on) is God the son, the second person of the Trinity. 

##### The book of Zechariah presents Christ as: 

###### *The Angel of the **Lord***. Zechariah 1:11 

###### *The **man***. Zechariah 1:10, 1:11, 13:7

###### *The **Branch***. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12

###### God's ***Associate***. Zechariah 13:7

###### *The **Shepherd***. Zechariah 13:7

###### ***Priest***. Zechariah 6:13

###### *The **King***. Zechariah 9:9, 14:16, Isaiah 6:5, John 12:41

###### The ***Redeemer***. Zechariah 9:11

###### God's ***Servant***. Zechariah 3:8

###### The ***Stone***. Zechariah 3:7, 10:4

###### The tent **peg**. Zechariah 10:4

###### *Lord of the **whole** earth*. Zechariah 4:14, Revelation 11:4

###### *The Lord of **Hosts***. Zechariah 14:16

##### God's servant, the **Branch** is a man, who will build the Temple of the Lord. Zechariah 3:8, 6:12, Isaiah 11:1, Isaiah 60:21, Jeremiah 23:5, Jeremiah 33:15, Revelation 22:16

####  God's Associate **the** man. Zechariah 13:7

###### Genesis 3:15 - A **male** seed of the woman, Matthew 1:23, Galatians 4:4 - *but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, **come of woman**, come under law (Darby)*

###### John 1:14 - The eternal God put on **humanity**. He was fully God and fully human. Revelation 22:13, 16 

##### Christ was interceding on behalf of Israel before he became a man. He didn't need to put on humanity to intercede. He had to put on humanity to pay man's sin debt and become a substitute. 

##### The Angel of the Lord who will one day **destroy** the nations that go up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8

#### Zechariah 1:11b *They answered the man ..."We have patrolled the earth,* These **horses** went to gather intel regarding the current political climate of the earth. 

##### Obviously the horses symbolize something. We are not told if they have riders, nor what their colors mean. 

#### Zechariah 1:11c *and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.*" In the second year of Darius there prevailed universal peace; all the nations of the earlier Chaldaean empire were at rest, and lived in undisturbed prosperity. [[9\]](#_ftn9)

##### *Peaceful* (YASHAB) is to dwell or settle at ease. Genesis 20:15, Genesis 25:27

##### *Quiet* (SHAQAT) describes a state of undisturbed tranquility. It is a condition during the absence of war. Judges 3:30

#### To the reader the initial thought might be, "Peace at **last**, All is well!". However this report is not received well by the Angel of the Lord. 

#### Zechariah 1:12a *Then the Angel of the LORD said,* Instead of the interpreting angel answering Zechariah, the angel of the Lord asks a question to the Lord of hosts.

#### Zechariah 1:12b *"O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah*, The Angel of the Lord addresses the Lord of hosts, asking the duration of the discipline on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah. Jeremiah 25:11-12

###### We are reminded of Habakkuk’s cry to the Lord before Judah was taken into exile... "*How long, Lord, have I called for help, And You do not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save*." 

###### The Gentile nations were at **peace** at the expense of violence done to God's nation Israel. 

###### There is sense of total indifference on behalf of the nations towards Israel's sovereignty. Nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to posess their land within the quiet peace at the time. 

###### Even today, Israel is **treated** with contempt. 

#### The only reason the Lord allows it to play out is because God desires Israel to return to Him. So as long as Israel is in a state of unbelief, we can expect the absence of peace for the land of Israel. 

#### There is a difference between the kind of peaceful silence the world was experiencing at that time and the peace (SHALOM) which Messiah will bring in. 

#### SHALOM comes from the rood word SHALAM. 

##### In the translation of Exodus 21-22, SHALAM is translated as “*make it good*”, “*shall surely pay*”, “*make full restitution*” or to “*restore*”. The ancient Hebrew meaning of SHALAM was “*to make something whole*”. Not just regarding practical restoration of things that were lost or stolen. But with an overall sense of fulness and completeness in mind, body and estate. [[10\]](#_ftn10)

###### Genesis 43:27-28 *“Then he asked them about their **well-being*** [SHALOM], *and said, “Is your father **well*** [SHALOM], *the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” And they answered, “Your servant our father is **in good health*** [SHALOM]; *he is still alive.”* NKJV 

###### Messiah will bring in *shalom* between the offices of priest and king. Zechariah 6:13

###### Messiah will bring *shalom* to the land. Zechariah 8:12

###### Messiah will speak *shalom* to the nations. Zechariah 9:10

###### Messiah's name will be *prince of shalom*. Isaiah 9:6-7

##### True, world *shalom* will only be attained when Jesus Christ **rules** from His throne in Jerusalem. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4 

##### World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deeded her, Babylon is **utterly** destroyed and the Prince of Peace is reigning on His throne in Jerusalem. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5

#### Zechariah 1:12b *...with which You have been indignant these seventy years?"* God is shown to be in control of Israel's time, not the Gentile nations. God had said the time would be 70 years. 

##### The Angel of the Lord's words reflect his compassion for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are "*at peace*". 

##### The Angel of the Lord's part here perfectly anticipates Jesus' role as Intercessor for His people. 

#### Zechariah 1:13 *The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words*. We are told the sovereign Lord of the universe responds with **kind**, comforting words, but we're not told what those words were. Colossians 4:6

##### Psalm 94:19 *When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations delight my soul.*

##### Isaias 35:4 *Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you.*"

#### Zechariah 1:14a *So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying,* Just like the first message, this message was not to be **kept** hidden, it was to be proclaimed to the people. 

##### As a prophet Zechariah's task is not to receive the message for himself but to **relate** to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2 

###### *So*, this is in direct response to the intercessory request **made** by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12 

#### Zechariah 1:14b *'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous...* The Lord reminds his people "*I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!*" God has a **strong** devotion towards his possession, Israel. Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7 

##### His disposition goes beyond what we hear when it is said, "God has a plan for you, he wants to bless you". We must realize that God is jealously seeking his possession unto himself to not share with anyone or anything else. God is willing to go to great **lengths**, even to war against the nations because he desires a people unto himself. 

##### This would have been an important reminder to the **people** during this time where it could seemed God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel. 

#### Zechariah 1:14c *for Jerusalem and Zion*. Many times in Scripture we see Zion used synonymously with Jerusalem. Here **Zion** should be understood as even more specific. 

##### The earth is at the center of creation. Israel is the central nation of the world. Jerusalem is the central city in Israel. Zion is the mountain in Jerusalem where the **temple** will be built. Micah 3:12

#### The term, Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the **nations**. Micah 4:1

##### Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's throne will be established in the **city** of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6 

##### Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and **glory** to the nations. Micah 4:2

##### Zion can also refer to God's **people**. Zechariah 2:7, 2:10

#### Zechariah 1:15a *"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease;* The nations were at **ease** with the current circumstances of Israel. 

##### The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not possess her land. They have **done** nothing but oppress Israel. 

#### Zechariah 1:15b *for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster."* God was angry with the fathers but now the nations have angered God even more. Zechariah 1:2

##### Israel's **exile** a disaster because it was unnecessary. Yet the response of the nations made the calamity even worse. 

###### The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent **peace** and requests to know how much longer the status quo would be permitted to go on.

##### The Lord had warned the nations (especially in the case the Chaldeans) they would be judged for the **way** they treated of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34‑35, Amos 6:1 

#### Zechariah 1:16a *'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion;* Because of the injustice by the Gentile nations, God will symbolically return his presence to Jerusalem with compassion. 

#### Zechariah 1:16b *My house will be built in it...* the rebuilding of the temple is foretold **here**. The temple will be completed. 

### **Temples in the Bible**



|       | **Temple**                      | **Timeframe**                   |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1     | 1st - Solomon's                 | 958b.C. - 586          |
| **2** | **2nd -  Zerubbabel's**         | **515b.C.-70a.D.**              |
|       | Mount Gerizim  (Samaritans)     | 450b.C.-110            |
| 3     | 3rd - Tribulation  temple       | Near end of  tribulation        |
| **4** | **4th - The  Messiah's** Temple | **Millennium -  New Jerusalem** |

#### House or temple (BAYITH) appears **31** times in Zechariah. 

##### It can refer to a physical building. 

###### God's Temple. Zechariah 1:16, 3:7, 4:9, 7:3, 8:9, 11:13, 14:20, 14:21 

###### The temple in **Shinar**. Zechariah 5:11 

###### A dwelling for a person. Zechariah 6:10, 14:2

##### It can refer to a family or people. For instance, the house of Judah or the **house** of Israel. Zechariah 8:13, 8:15, 8:19, 10:3, 10:6, 12:4, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:12, 12:13, 13:1

##### It can **refer** to a religious system. Zechariah 7:3, 13:6, 5:4

#### Zechariah 1:16c *declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.*"' the rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been astounding to hear especially while the **city** lied ruins. 

##### About 200 years earlier, **God** had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would raise up someone to deliver them from Babylon and Jerusalem would be built. 

###### Isaiah 44:28 *It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"* . 

###### Zechariah adds to Isaiah's prophecy that **under** Zerubbabel, the temple will be finished. Zechariah 4:9-10 

#### Zechariah 1:17a *"Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion*. Psalm 132:13

####  The Lord of hosts promises overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a **special** emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15 

##### While the prophecy of verse 16 finds its fulfilment in Zechariah's **time**, verse 17 is clearly yet future. 

##### Overflowing prosperity in the land and the Lord comforting Zion will come about after Israel returns to the Lord. Zechariah 13:9 

####  Zechariah 1:17 *and again choose Jerusalem...* God will once again place his attention on Jerusalem. Zechariah 2:12, 8:8, 13:9

####  What does it mean to once **again** choose Jerusalem? 

##### 70 years prior, God removed the people from the land. They were exiled to a foreign land. There was no mention of Jerusalem as God had intended her. 

##### Though the priests garments soil their garments, though Israel was unfaithful, the nation continued to be God's chosen vessel. Zechariah 3:2

##### God sovereignly chose the nation of Israel for the purpose of carrying out his redemptive plan for humanity and earthly restoration. 2 Chronicles 6:6

## Zechariah 1:18-21 A Vision of four horns & four craftsmen

#### Zechariah 1:18 *Then I lifted up my eyes and **looked**, and behold,* there were four **horns**. Zechariah became suddenly aware of four horns. 

##### Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or **nations**. In verse 21 we see it was *nations* *lifted up their horns* against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17

#### Zechariah 1:19a *So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?"* Zechariah did not readily understand what the meaning of what he **saw**. 

#### He saw horns but he realized they symbolize something. He asks the interpreting angel what they are. 

####  Zechariah 1:19b *And he answered me,* "*These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.*" These horns (typically powers or empires) are identified as having scattered the people. 

####  Differing opinion exist as to the identity of the horns. 

##### Option 1: Nations in the past. Assyria, Egypt, Babylonia, and Medo-Persia—are in view here.

##### Option 2: The 4 empires of the Times of the Gentiles mentioned in Daniel. Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that **oppress** Israel. Ezekiel 34:11-31 

###### The second option seems best although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel's prophecy would probably associate these 4 **horns** with Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome. 

###### The identity of the horns is not stated...yet they clearly portray total domination of the people of Israel by the powers that attacked and conquered them. [^11]

####  Zechariah 1:20 *Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, "What are these coming to do?"* Zechariah needed to know what the 4 horns were. When he sees the craftsmen coming, he asks what they would **do**. 

####  A craftsman is a skillful **artisan**. He is known by what he does with his hands. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31 

#### Zechariah 1:21b *And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man lifts up his head;* through oppression, **sorrow**, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15

##### This was Judah's current condition even though they were allowed back into the land. They still lived under the domination of Medo-Persia at the time. 

##### Jerusalem will be trampled underfoot until the end of the "**Times** of the Gentiles".

#### Zechariah 1:21c *but these craftsmen have come to terrify them,* The artisans come to cause these nations to shudder. 

#### Zechariah 1:21d *to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it."* The enemy nations will be dealt with accordingly. Jeremiah 50:45-46 

##### to throw down - is one word in Hebrew (YADAW) meaning to cast out. Just like these nations caused Judah to be sent away, so too these craftsmen come to cast these nations away. 

##### Even though the horns had scattered **Judah**, God told Zechariah the four craftsmen who would come to throw them down. 

##### Some suggest these craftsmen are the very successors to the **horns**. For instance, the first craftsman would be Medo-Persia casting out Babylon. 

##### The final craftsman in this case would be none other than Messiah himself who comes and casts out the last of the four horns. 

#### This vision served to encourage Zechariah's audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the **Lord** ultimately had the stronger hand over the nations.

## Zechariah 2:1-13 A vision of measuring Jerusalem

#### Zechariah 2:1a *Then I lifted up my eyes and **looked**, and behold...* No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a **man** who had an 

#### Zechariah 2:1b ...*there was a man with a a measuring line in his hand.* Though not the angel of the Lord, there is a similar angel with the form of a man in Ezekiel 40:3; 41; 42; in another connection it is seen in Revelation 11:1-2

#### Zechariah 2:2a *So I said, "Where are you going?"* Interestingly, the vision is such that Zechariah interacts with the person in the vision. 

##### Zechariah was puzzled as to **where** he was going. 

####  Zechariah 2:2b *And he said to me,* *"To measure Jerusalem,* *to see how wide it is* *and how long it is."* The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to **measure** Jerusalem. 

##### Zechariah was in Jerusalem that had been abandoned for 70 years. Zechariah 7:14, Ezekiel 33:28

###### Nehemiah mentions the conditions the city was in...*The remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire."* Nehemiah 1:3, 2:17

####  Zechariah 2:3 *And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him...,* While Zechariah is still considering where the man (angel) is going to measure, another angel heads out to meet him. 

####  Zechariah 2:4a *and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying,* the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting **angel** to *run*! 

####  Zechariah 2:4b '*Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.* The urgent message was that one day Jerusalem would be filled with multitudes of men and cattle.

##### Though the date of fulfillment is not stated, it would have been of great encouragement that day! 

###### Knowing of Jerusalem's future prosperity would promote the **rebuilding** of the temple.

##### Such an increase in population as here predicted could not come from the return of a large number of Jews from Babylon; it looks on to a far future day, indicated in verse 5. [[12\]](#_ftn12)

#### Zechariah 2:5a *'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her,* God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for **walls**.

##### Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy **attacks**. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3

##### Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it's even harder to see her not needing **walls**. 

###### Just like God would be the walls around a prosperous Jerusalem in the future, so could God be the walls of protection around a tattered one. By faith, trusting in God's protection, Judah was safe because the Lord of hosts was for them to rebuild the temple. 

#### Zechariah 2:5b *and I will be the glory in her midst.'"* This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem herself but God in her **midst**. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11

##### What a delightful future hope Judah is given. In the very spot where Zechariah was standing, would one day be filled with people and animals. God would be the protecting wall around her and the glory in her midst. Psalm 46:5

## Zechariah 2:6-13 Poem of God’s wrath upon the nations 

### **Zechariah 2:6-9 The unmoved exiles** 

#### Zechariah 2:6 *"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,"* *declares the LORD,* *"for I have dispersed you* *as the four winds of the heavens,"* *declares the LORD.* 

##### The land of the north is probably referring to Babylon. Jeremiah 6:22; 16:16

###### Babylon is to the **east** of Jerusalem but you had to go north out of Israel to get there. 

##### This was directed to Zechariah's generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not warning them flee and return to the land. 

##### This began then but continues today due to the lethargic response of the people who got decided to remain in their foreign lands. 

#### Zechariah 2:7 *"Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."* Two religious systems are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon. 

##### The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the children of the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17 

##### This is one and the same with the religious system started in **Babel**. Revelation 17:5

##### The command is for God's people to flee the idolatrous of Babylon which has covered the four winds of earth. 

#### Zechariah 2:8 *For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.* God is jealous over His possession, **Israel**. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10, Psalm 105:15

##### blessings and curses fall on nations based on their treatment of Israel. Nobody touches her and gets away with it. He is her defender. Jeremiah 2:3, Revelation 17:14

###### Since the nations had plundered them, God would manifest glory by plundering them. 

###### The Lord does not visit judgment on Israel’s plunderers after He is dwelling in Zion, but before it. Zechariah 12-14; Revelation 16-20

####  Zechariah 2:9a *"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves.* The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately *shatter them like earthenware* and give the **nations** as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2

##### In a show of power, God will make these nations (*them*) to serve Israel (*their slaves*). One day Israel will be the greatest **nation** on earth. Isaiah 14:2, Zephaniah 2:9

####  Zechariah 2:9b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.* A most important **aspect** of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled. 

##### Prophecy is **given** by God in a way that when it is fulfilled "*...you will know that I am the Lord*" Exodus 6:7 

##### The phrase "*you will know*" **occurs** 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know it was God because God had told them. Zechariah 2:9, 11, 4:9, 6:15

##### Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no **doubt** of its fulfillment. Ezekiel 12:20, Zechariah 4:9, John 8:28

### Zechariah 2:10-11 - The discouraged returnees 

#### Zechariah 2:10a *"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion;* The daughter of Zion (God's people) needed to rejoice instead of bemoaning their current circumstances with their heads hung low. 

#### Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for **Judah** to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9 

#### Zechariah 2:10b *for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.* This is a Messianic prophecy. One day, Messiah Zechariah 1:16, 

##### Dwell (SHAKAN) conveys the idea of residing or permanently staying. 

####  Zechariah 2:11a *"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.*

##### Zechariah uses a term '*in that day*' 19 times throughout the book. It can refer to the period of time defined by the context but also it can refer to a specific period known as The Day of the Lord. 

##### This is a reference to the **day** of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel's rule. 

### **The Day of the Lord - a brief explanation**

#### The Day of the Lord is a major eschatological theme. It is a common topic in both New and Old Testaments. 

##### Of the **19** uses of '*in that day*' in the book of Zechariah, 16 of those times are in chapters 12-14. We've listed those we believe refer to The Day of the Lord in the order of their appearance.

##### The nations will be united to the Lord

###### Zechariah 2:11 "*Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people...*Zechariah 13:9 

##### There will be prosperity and safety

###### Zechariah 3:10 *...every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree...*Micah 4:4, Jeremiah 31:5, 32:15, 

###### Zechariah 9:16-17 *...God will save them in that day As the flock of His people...*Zechariah 12:8, 

##### The Lord of hosts goes to battle against the nations, protecting Jerusalem

###### Zechariah 12:3 *...I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples...*Joel 3:2, 9-15, Revelation 19, Obadiah 1:15 

###### Zechariah 12:4 *...I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah...* Zechariah 14:15, Ezekiel 39:20

###### Zechariah 12:6 *...I will make the clans of Judah...they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples...* Micah 4:13, Psalm 149:6-9

###### Zechariah 12:8 *...the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem...*

###### Zechariah 12:9 *...I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.* Haggai 2:22

###### Zechariah 12:11 *...there will be great mourning in Jerusalem...* Matthew 24:30

##### Restoration of Israel 

###### Zechariah 13:1 *...a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.* Ezekiel 47:1

###### Zechariah 13:2 *...I will cut off the names of the idols from the land...I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land...*Zephaniah 2:11

###### Zechariah 13:4 *...the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies...*Micah 3:6

##### The coming of Messiah in power and glory

###### Zechariah 14:4 .*..His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives...*Acts 1:11

###### Zechariah 14:6 *...there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.* Matthew 24:29

##### Peace and prosperity will follow

###### Zechariah 14:8 *...living waters will flow out of Jerusalem...*Isaiah 35:7, 41:18, Joel 3:17-21 - flows into dead sea. During Millennium there will be fishing there.

###### Zechariah 14:9 *...the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.* Deuteronomy 6:4, Habakkuk 2:14, 

###### Zechariah 14:13 *...a great panic from the LORD will fall on them...*Mark 13:8

##### Integral worship to the Lord

###### Zechariah 14:20 *...there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD."...*Revelation 20:6

###### Zechariah 14:21 *...there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.* Zephaniah 3:17

##### The Day of the Lord is like a Jewish day. 

###### It begins at sundown with the Tribulation period. Zephaniah 1:14-18

###### The second coming at the break of dawn. Zechariah 14:1-4

###### Mid-day is during the Millennial Kingdom. 2 Peter 3:10, 1 Thessalonians 5:2, 2 Peter 3:10

###### Sundown is the Great White Throne judgment. Revelation 20

##### The day of the Lord begins sometime after the rapture. 1 Thessalonians 1:10, 5:9, 2 Thessalonians 2:3

###### Specifically, when a peace treaty is signed with Antichrist. This begins the Tribulation period. Daniel 9:27

##### The day of the Lord ends with the Great White Throne. Revelation 20

#### The nature of the Day

##### The overarching element in the Day of the Lord is judgment.

###### God will pour out His wrath starting on Israel.

###### God will pour out His wrath on the nations according to their treatment of Israel.

##### The use of fire is seen throughout. 

###### Revelation 8:5,7,9:18, 14:18, 16:8 17:16, Revelation 18:8, 20:9, Ezekiel 38:22, Joel 2:3, Joel 2:30, 2 Thessalonians 1:7

###### Obviously James and John were out of line when they asked if they should call out fire from heaven, but where would the disciples get this idea from? They knew one day the Lord will judge the earth with fire. Luke 9:54

#### Events contained within the Day of the Lord

##### The formation of a federation of nations into a revived Roman Empire. Daniel 2:7

##### The rise of the Antichrist. Daniel 9:27, Revelation 13:1-10

##### The formation of a one world religion. Revelation 13:11-18

##### The seal judgments. Revelation 6

##### The sealing of the 144,000 Jewish men. Revelation 7, Matthew 24:14

##### The trumpet judgments. Revelation 8-11

##### The Abomination of Desolation. Matthew 24:15

##### The two witnesses. Revelation 11

##### The persecution of Israel. Revelation 12

##### The bowl judgments. Revelation 16

##### The rise and fall of Babylon. Revelation 17-18

##### Armageddon. Ezekiel 38-39, Revelation 16:16, 19:17-21

##### The purging of the heavens and earth. 2 Peter 3:10-13

##### The regathering of Israel into the land. Ezekiel 37:1-44, Matthew 24:31

##### The restoration of Israel to the land. Amos 9:15

##### The Second Coming. Matthew 24:29-30

##### The resurrection of Old Testament and Tribulation saints. John 6:39-40, Revelation 20:4

##### The Beast and the False Prophet cast into the lake of fire. Revelation 19:11-21

##### The Sheep and Goats Judgment. Matthew 25

##### The binding of Satan for 1000 years. Revelation 20:2-3

##### The Millennium. Revelation 20

##### The final rebellion of Satan. Revelation 20

##### The Great White Throne Judgment. Revelation 20

####  The Day of the Lord is referring to a future period of time when God **begins** working with Israel as a nation and ends with its ultimate restoration. 

### Zechariah 2:11b *Then I will dwell in your midst...* The rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem is ultimately for God's dwelling place to be established. From here He will dwell with Israel and reign over the whole earth. 

##### God dwelling in their midst is what the tabernacle and **temple** symbolized. Exodus 25:8

#### Zechariah 2:11c *and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.* Messiah, God himself, in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day **dwell** in their midst forever. 

##### In the person of **Christ**, God will literally dwell among His people in Jerusalem. Zechariah 8:3, Ezekiel 48:8, 

#### Zechariah 2:12 *"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.* 

####  Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God's **people**. 

##### They did not walk with God as a nation in keeping the covenant, and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25 

####  Zechariah 2:13 *"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."* God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His **land**, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4 

## Zechariah 3:1-10 A vision of Joshua the high priest

### Zechariah sees Jeshua being accused before the Lord

#### Zechariah 3:1a *Then he **showed me** Joshua the high priest* as a priest, Zechariah would have known Joshua well. 

#### Zechariah 3:1b *standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.* This setting reminds us of Job. Job was blameless before people and the Lord brings him up. 

##### This time, Satan brings up Joshua the High priest and accuse him before the angel of the LORD Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; 1 Chronicles 21:1; Revelation 12:10

#### Zechariah 3:2a *The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan!* This preincarnate altercation between Christ and Satan shows the ongoing battle that wages on throughout history. 

####  Zechariah 3:2b *the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!* Satan's accusation is directed against Joshua who symbolizes Jerusalem. 

####  Zechariah 3:2c *Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"* Israel was plucked out the fire. Not once, not twice, but many times. 

###### In context perhaps this is referring to being delivered from Babylon. 

####  Zechariah 3:3a *Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments* This was Joshua's condition representing the priesthood and all of Israel. There was no need for Satan to try to find something, the situation was obvious. The **stench** of the soiled garments alone gives him away.

##### Zechariah saw Joshua standing before the angel of the LORD dressed in excrement bespattered garments. Isaiah 4:4[[13\]](#_ftn13)

##### Filthy garments did not symbolize the criminal in Israel, but one in the pollution of sin. [[14\]](#_ftn14)

###### Isaiah 64:6 *For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; And all of us wither like a leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.*

####  Zechariah 3:3b-4a and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, 

#### Zechariah 3:4b *saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him."* Joshua represents the **current** state of Israel.

##### What a delightful **scene** to see the Angel of the Lord defending Joshua and exchanging his filthy clothes for clean ones. 

#### Zechariah 3:4c *Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes."* If dirty clothes symbolized iniquity, then festal robes must mean righteousness as a result of being fully forgiven. 

##### Isaiah 61:10 I will rejoice greatly in the LORD, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland, And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

#### This is a spiritual transformation by divine interaction. From being in a state of feeling shame to feeling accepted. Micah 7:18-19, Isaiah 51:2 

##### Zechariah (being a priest himself) can't contain his excitement to see the filthy **clothes** removed and festive ones put on and exclaims...

#### Zechariah 3:5a *Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head."* The priestly garment included a turban. Leviticus 8:9

##### clean (TAHOR) - implies the sense of purity. 

##### The mitre or turban of the high priest had fastened to it the plate of gold engraved with the words “*Holiness to the Lord.*” Exodus 28:36-38[[15\]](#_ftn15)

#### Zechariah 3:5b *So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.* Zechariah as priest is seen intervening on behalf of Joshua. 

##### This is so essential to the message of grace **then** and now. 

###### It was the Lord who **removed** unrighteousness. Joshua the priest, even the high priest, took no part whatsoever.

###### Joshua did not confess his sin. It was the angel of the Lord who took the initiative based on God's covenant.  

###### It was God who **clothed** Him with festal robes. The dress goes beyond being acceptable, they are appropriate for service to the Lord. These were the robes for festal worship! 

##### The same is true today for the Church age saint. We have been clothed in the righteousness of Christ. His righteousness has been imputed to our account. This is justification. 

###### We can fall prey to Satan's accusations and enter a downward spiral of self-condemnation. Doubt and discouragement are sure to follow. Jude 1:20-23

###### There is no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus. Jude 1:24-25

###### Christian, wear your festal robes with rejoicing! 

#### Zechariah 3:6-7a *And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts,* The admonishment comes after the Lord has defended him and taken away His iniquity. 

### The priesthood is reinstated 

#### Zechariah 3:7b *'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,* having been cleansed, having had their sins **taken** away by the Lord, now Joshua is told to walk in God's ways and in His service. 

##### As Joshua stands before the Lord in festal robes, he is admonished by the Lord to walk in His ways as a representative of who He is. 

##### Here we that twice the condition "if" is given. This is a responsibility given to Joshua. He is to walk in God's ways and perform His service. 

###### Unfortunately, we so often hear that cleansing only comes after **we** remove our sin or if we try hard enough not to sin. 

###### Acceptance before God is not earned through service. Service to God is the outworking of the acceptance one already has before the Lord. 

##### *If...you will walk...*the first condition was of a personal nature. Joshua was to have regard for his personal walk with the Lord first and foremost. 

##### *If...you will perform...*the second condition was then to perform ministerial service of the temple. 

###### Joshua is being charged to **walk** with God in fellowship in order for ministerial service to take place. God is reestablishing the priestly duties under the Mosaic covenant. 

#### Zechariah 3:7c *then you will also govern My house...* The Lord of **Hosts** gave the priests the responsibility to govern the temple so long as they walked in His ways. Ezekiel 44:15-16 

##### *govern* (DIN) - this carries with it the idea of judging. 

##### *If...then you will govern My house*...refers to the Temple then in building. The duties of the priests included deciding and judging between clean and unclean. Leviticus 10:8, 10, Deuteronomy 17:9, Ezekiel 44:23, and Malachi 2:7 [[16\]](#_ftn16)

##### Ironically, when the Lord Jesus came, He confronted the hypocrisy of the chief priests and removed all doubt that they had lost this privilege for their failure to keep the **first** clause, "*if **you** will walk in my ways...*". Matthew 21:23-27 

#### Zechariah 3:7d *and also have charge of My courts...* the courts must refer to that which took place in the event of quarrels. The religious leaders were to **act** as judges and deal with fairness and justice. 

##### The courts, too, had to be guarded from profanation; care had to be exercised as to the kind of persons who were to be allowed to enter.[[17\]](#_ftn17)

####  Zechariah 3:7e *and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here.* The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the **holy** of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. 

##### This was possible only to priests who were ritually and morally pure. Exodus 40:30-33

##### The conditions were put as to the condition of experience and service, not acceptance. 

##### Governing things regarding the **temple**, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in His ways first and foremost. 

##### In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has **access** directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5

##### Prior to ministry service, the church age saint is first to be walking in fellowship, abiding in Christ. John 15:4-5, Romans 8:12-13

###### It is the spiritual believer, learning from the Word through the teaching of the Spirit, that is equipped for the ministry of service. Ephesians 4:11-12

####  Zechariah 3:8a *'Now listen, Joshua the high priest,* Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the **high** priest. 

####  Zechariah 3:8b *you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol,* you and your friends - **friends** refers to the priesthood. 

##### They set apart to be a type or symbolize what God will one day provide in a perfect Priest from a higher order. 

###### While Joshua and his colleges would serve in the earthly temple, Christ who entered the Holy of Holies in heaven, who is seated at the right hand of the father, will one day serve in the Millennial temple as the Priest and King. 

####  Zechariah 3:8a *for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.* What this is saying that the temple service of the priests was prophet and to be fulfilled by God's Servant, the Branch.

##### *My servant*. **Clearly** a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5; Luke 11:37-54; Isaiah 42:1, 49:3, 50:10, 52:13, 53:11; Ezekiel 34:23-24; Philippians 2:6-8 

##### *The **Branch*** (sprout) is a man, who will build the Temple of the Lord. Zechariah 3:8; Isaiah 11:1; Isaiah 60:21; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:15; Revelation 22:16; Isaiah 4:2, 11:1; 53:2, Jeremiah 23:5, 33:15

###### It will be *the Branch* will build the Millennial temple, which is unlike any other temple. Zechariah 6:12-13 

#### Zechariah 3:9a *'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes.* This addition is very interesting..."*before Joshua*" *the **stone**.*

##### Here we see a third name for Messiah, the stone. While we know Christ is the prophesied cornerstone. Genesis 49:24, Psalm 118:22; Isaiah 28:16; Matthew 21:42; Acts 4:11; and 1 Peter 2:6

##### Zechariah adds descriptive information to the stone. It has seven eyes, probably referring to the attribute of omniscience the Messiah will possess. 

###### These may be the same seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.

##### Daniel, when describing the characteristics of Antichrist states he has eyes like a man's. Daniel 7:8, 11:21, Zechariah 11:17

#### Zechariah 3:9b *Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.* 

##### While the work of the cross is implied here and certainly the iniquity of the land being removed is on the basis of the victory acquired by Messiah on the cross, it is not referring to that here. Hebrews 10:10, 12, 14

##### This is the day, the very day iniquity is removed of the land...that is...the day of her forgiveness when all of Israel will place their faith in Jesus Messiah. 

##### This is a once for all event. There will be no need for a repetition or renewal; His work will be once for all. 

#### Zechariah 3:10a *'In that day,' this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor...* 

##### When Israel is found in such a spiritual condition-so reads the united testimony of the Old Testament, material prosperity is always promised her. [[18\]](#_ftn18)

##### Thus we read of the peace and prosperity of the time in verse 10. 1 Kings 4:25, Micah 4:4

#### Zechariah 3:10b *to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'"* This is an image of **peace** and blessing will be like in the kingdom age due to their iniquity being absolved. 

##### Having vines and fig trees **ripe** with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakkuk 3:17 

### This vision is regarding Joshua the high priest as he stands accused before the Angel of the Lord. Joshua represents the priesthood and It appears to be the reaffirming of the priests for typical service until the Messiah would come to build His temple. 

##### If the spiritual leadership of Judah needed encouraging, no doubt the civil leadership did as well. The next vision will deal with that. 

## Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold

### The following vision is directed for Zerubbabel. 

#### Who is Zerubbabel? 

##### The civil governor of Judah

##### Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an **ancestor** of Jesus Christ. Matthew 1:6, 12

##### His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the **king** (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge. 

#### Zechariah 4:1 *Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep.* The word then shows this vision came afterward. Since the vision was at **night**, the interpreting angel roused Zechariah so he was wide awake when receiving the vision. 

#### Zechariah 4:2a *He said to me, "What do you **see**?" And I said, "I **see**, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks*...

##### Many who make no distinction between the Church and Israel (a demarcation which is one of the clearest in the Bible), think the figure stands for the Church. [[19\]](#_ftn19)

###### It is true that lampstands are used as a figure of the Church in Revelation 1:12, 20, and that the Church is compared to lights in Philippians 2:15, but the Church is not a matter of prophecy in the Old Testament. [[20\]](#_ftn20)

###### The Church is foretold for the first time in the New Testament. Matthew 16:18

####  Zechariah 4:2b *and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;* Exodus 25:37 

####  Zechariah 4:3 *also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side."* 

####  Zechariah 4:4 *Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?"*

####  Zechariah 4:5 *So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said,"No, my lord."* 

#### Zechariah 4:6a *Then he said to me,*...we note the particular build-up and suspense for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained.

#### Zechariah 4:6b *"This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,...* this is a specific message to Zerubbabel. 

###### We know from the prophet Ezra that Zerubbabel listened and followed what **God** commanded. Ezra 5:2

###### Therefore this message is of a different tone than it was to the people in general. Zechariah is of a sincere nature but evidently is trying to bring about results in his own strength. 

#### Zechariah 4:6c *"This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,...'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts...* 

##### As a chosen leader, Zerubbabel must have had natural talents and abilities. Yet God is saying not civil, political, physical, natural or any kind of human power but God says the temple building will be brought about by His Spirit. 

###### God is offering Zerubbabel an option that perhaps Zerubbabel had been too busy to even consider. God says this, what about trusting My power to be your strength? 

###### The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they **began** rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14

##### This is a wonderful illustration to show how God wants us to live as Christians. The teaching of God's grace is what instructs us how to really live; to **trust**, to depend on God for His strength (My Spirit) not our own (power). Titus 2:11-12

##### All believers get their enabling strengthening by grace. Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2 

##### The grace of God teaches God's full provision for salvation from sin's penalty and for the provision of **daily** living being delivered from sin's power, while pointing to the amazing hope of our final redemption.

##### This is certainly contrary to those who say, "ease does not produce **strength**". They teach that one must find strength through spiritual disciplines. 

##### God's power certainly does not lack man's strength and He freely bestows it to those believers who take Him up on the option to trust Him. 1 Samuel 14:6, Hosea 1:7, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, Hebrews 11:34, 2 Corinthians 4:7

##### The lampstand symbolizes Israel when she is fully restored as the means of light fueled by the Holy Spirit (the unending supply of oil), unto the world. Exodus 19:6

##### They were to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. This summarizes chapters 3 and 4. 

#### Zechariah 4:7a *'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain;* Mountains can symbolize different things in Scripture. 

##### In this case the mountain is how Zerubbabel sees his current situation. The obstacles are a great mountain. 

##### Yet nothing is too great for the man who has the Lord of Hosts battling for him. A weak **man** who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable by the impossible! 

###### The task Zerubbabel is given is from first to last a spiritual work, it must be by the omnipotent and unfailing and unerring Spirit of God.

#### Zechariah 4:7b *and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"* The top **stone** is what is placed at the end of a building to complete it. 

##### Zerubbabel will see the temple finished, but not the way he might have thought. 

##### The shouting of grace to the Messiah would be meaningless. The idea is that the grace of God in the power of the Holy Spirit will make this work to be realized. Not by God's intervention, not man's might but by God's power enabling the human vessel who trusts Him! 

###### The shouts at the end are grace, grace not “Zerubba, Zerubba!”. The people will credit the completion to be thanks to God's **working**. To God is the glory when God motivates and strengthens His laborious unto His work! Ezra 6:14

##### God's Spirit glorifies God, not our strength (might, prowess, ability, wisdom). The shouts of grace, grace, demonstrates trust in God for the results.

###### Our incompetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work when we trust Him. The evidence...God brought it about! This is God using Zerubbabel's hands as instruments to bring glory to himself. To God is the glory! 

##### One day all of Israel will recognize the high cost that needed to be paid for their redemption and they will see their Savior as the one they pierced. The value of grace is understood only upon the realization of the payment Christ made. Zechariah 12:10, John 19:34, Acts 2:32, 36-37

#### Zechariah 4:8-9a *Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it.* Haggai 2:23

##### Once the rebuilding started back up, it took 4 years and 3 months for this promise to be literally fulfilled. Ezra 6:15

###### The second temple was **finished** 70 years after the first one was destroyed. 

#### Zechariah 4:9b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.* Me is not Zechariah but Messiah. 

##### This is the people rejoicing in response, **giving** credence to God's provision. 

#### Zechariah 4:10a *"For who has despised the day of small things?* 

##### The second temple wasn't as glorious as the first. The **older** generation that had seen Solomon's temple were sorely disappointed. 

###### When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with **raw** materials. He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world. 

##### On the other hand, Zurabbabel had God instructing Him and the His Spirit as the power. 

#### Zechariah 4:10b *But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel* a **plumb** line is an instrument for building. 

#### Zechariah 4:10c *these are the eyes of the LORD* the seven eyes Revelation 5:6 

##### The running of God’s eyes throughout the whole earth speaks of God’s providential care put forth for the finishing of the Temple. (For the same figure see 2 Ch 16:9.) 

#### Zechariah 4:10d *which range to and for throughout the earth."* God sees everything...nothing is hidden from Him. Isaiah 40:27, Matthew 6:6, 8, 18

#### Zechariah 4:10 *But these seven...will see and be glad...* Don’t despise things that appear **small**! What matters is how the Lord sees it! 

##### The omniscient Lord would be pleased when He saw the building project restarted. 

##### The second temple serves as a type of the humble aspect of Messiah. The second temple was despised for it's humble size, so too the Messiah would appear as a humble servant. 

###### God rejoices in the day when the second temple was completed just like He will be delighted when the restoration of Israel is complete through the work of Messiah. Isaiah 53

#### Zechariah 4:11 *Then I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"* The lamp doesn't **seem** to draw Zechariah's attention like the olive trees on each side. 

#### Zechariah 4:12a *And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,* 

#### Zechariah 4:12b *which empty the golden oil from themselves?*" 

#### Zechariah 4:13 *So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."* 

#### Zechariah 4:14a *Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."* The answer is given as to the significance of the two trees beside the lampstand. 

##### *Anointed ones* literally means sons of oil. 

#### Man is often compared to a tree in the Old Testament. Psalm 1:3, 52:8, Jeremiah 17:8, Daniel 4:10 

#### There are many differing opinions as to the identity of these two anointed ones. 

##### Chapters three and four are connected and complementary. The priestly office (Joshua) and the civil office (Zerubbabel) have been dealt with accordingly. 

###### An interesting consideration for the identity of these two anointed ones are the very two men the context refers to; Joshua and Zerubbabel. 

#### Someone has suggested the two witnesses are the two offices (priesthood and civic) expressed in "sons of oil" to carry out the role. 

#### Can we see this sort of thing anywhere else? 

##### The book of Revelation mentions two witnesses. The identity of these two witnesses also remains a mystery, however applying the same reasoning, Moses (civil power) and Elijah (religious power). Revelation 11:3-4

###### If these two in Revelation are Moses and Elijah, there are the civil and religious powers represented as with Zerubbabel and Joshua. [[21\]](#_ftn21)

###### The beast (civil power) and the false prophet (religious power) would be an interesting falsification of this union. Revelation 13 

###### The ultimate fulfillment of verse 14 is the Messiah, who is both King and Priest. Zechariah 6:11-13 [[22\]](#_ftn22)

#### Zechariah 4:14b *Lord of the whole earth...* Is clearly a reference to **Christ**. Revelation 11:4 

#### The fulfillment of this is when Messiah will be Lord of the whole earth. 

## Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll

### Chapter 5 deals with God's judgment on Israel while the nations will be judged in chapter 6. 

#### Individual judgment on Israel

#### Zechariah 5:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes again and **looked**, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,* Zechariah looked up again and saw a two sided scroll swooping down. 

##### It had writing on the one side and writing on the other. Zechariah 5:3

#### Zechariah 5:2 *"What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits."* The scroll was very large and twice as long as it was wide. 

##### The porch in front of the nave of the first temple was twenty cubits by ten cubits. 1 Kings 6:3

##### The dimensions of the two cherubim were ten cubits high and together totaled 20 cubits wide with their wings spread out. 1 Kings 6:23-27

###### The vision would teach us that the holiness of the sanctuary of the Lord is the measure of sin and that judgment must begin at the house of God. 1 Peter 4:17-18[[23\]](#_ftn23)

####  Zechariah 5:3a *Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land;* This time the angel interprets the meaning right away. The flying scroll represents a curse. Ezekiel 2:9-3:27, Jeremiah 36, Revelation 5, Isaiah 30:8

##### Under the Mosaic covenant agreement, the people experienced blessings when they kept it but coursings when they didn't. Deuteronomy 27:15-26, 28:15-68

##### This curse is not intended for the whole earth but for the whole land of Israel. This is a curse directed specifically at individual people of Israel for not keeping the covenant. 

####  Zechariah 5:3b *surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side,* Malachi 3:6-9, Zechariah 8:17

##### Just like the law was given to Moses on two tablets, the scroll had two sides. The writing on one side dealt with sins committed against God, while the writing on the other side was regarding sins committed against man. Exodus 32:15-16

##### The first tablet were commandments dealing with God, while the second tablet was how to treat man. 

###### Stealing would be breaking the middle command on the second tablet.

####  Zechariah 5:3c *and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.* Jeremiah 5:2

##### Swearing falsely by God's name is breaking the middle commandment on one first tablet.

####  Zechariah 5:4a *"I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts,* Malachi 3:5

##### God himself says he will make the curse go forth. The curse will be totally successful in it's purpose of cutting out the violators of the law. 

#### Zechariah 5:4b *"and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name;* The curse will hit the house of those judged by the flying scroll. Proverbs 11:1

##### The people had turned to dishonest means (lying and swearing) so that they could build their elaborate homes. Haggai 1:3-4, 6, 9

###### Haggai 2:9 *"Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house To put his nest on high To be delivered from the hand of calamity!*

###### Haggai 2:10 *"You have devised a shameful thing for your house By cutting off many peoples; So you are sinning against yourself.*

###### Haggai 2:11 *"Surely the stone will cry out from the wall, And the rafter will answer it from the framework.*

#### Zechariah 5:4c *and it will spend the night...*this phrase could also be translated it shall remain. Some suggest this to be the better interpretation. Psalm 49:12, Exodus 20:5, Proverbs 3:33

#### Zechariah 5:4d *within that house and consume it with its timber and stones."* The curse will go into the house of the ones found guilty by the scroll. Their house would be consumed. Amos 3:15

##### Those who built their home sanctuaries using dishonest means while ignoring God's house will have no place to hide, the curse will enter their home and consume it. Habakkuk 2:9-11, James 5:2-3

###### Nothing will be left of their own house for which they have worked so hard, for which they had neglected God’s house. Haggai 1:4

## Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket

### Verses 5-11 deal with national judgment on Israel in a future time. While the previous sin deals with sinful deeds, this vision deals with sin as a whole or system. 

#### Zechariah 5:5 *Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Lift up now your eyes and **see** what this is going forth."* Following the vision of the scroll, Zechariah was encouraged to look up again. 

#### Zechariah 5:6a *I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth."* the ephah was a standard unit of measuring volume. It was associated with a certain container. 

##### The ephah was a dry measure used for measuring barley or wheat. Therefore it is a symbol of commerce or trade. Ezekiel 45:9-11, Amos 8:5, Isaiah 5:10

#### Zechariah 5:6b-7a *Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land*

##### The Berean study Bible renders this verse as *their iniquity through all the land*. 

##### The ephah as a whole symbolized their iniquity or appearance in the land as a whole. 

##### The implication is that it had become a national problem. This was not just an issue on an individual level. They had become nationally known for using dishonest measures. 

####  Zechariah 5:7b *(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah."* This must be connected to the people who were using dishonest gain but it does not need to be specific since the next verse we are told the ephah represents all the wickedness in the land. 

####  On top of the ephah was placed a heavy cover. 

##### Inside the small barrel was a woman. 

###### It is possible that the lead **cover** symbolizes ministry of the Holy Spirit in restraining evil. [[24\]](#_ftn24)

####  Zechariah 5:8 *Then he said, "This is Wickedness!"* The identity of the **woman** in the basket is given as the representation of wickedness. 

##### Wickedness includes Idolatry and all other forms of evil. Ezra 9, Isaiah 57, 65:1-7, 66:17

##### The woman (wickedness), is contained within the ephah (commerce) with a lead weight (perhaps the restraining of the Holy Spirit). 

###### In Hebrew, the feminine is used to present abstract concepts. Proverbs 2:16 and 5:3-4

####  Zechariah 5:8 *And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.* Even with the lid opened for a brief moment, wickedness wanted to get out but she was thrown in by the angel and contained by the lid. 

##### During the church age, the Holy Spirit plays the important role of restraining the man of lawlessness. 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8

###### After the church age, during the Tribulation period, wickedness will not be held back. She will do as she pleases, wherever she pleases. However a time will come when God will remove wickedness from Israel. 

#### Zechariah 5:9 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings;* two women were needed because of the weight. 

#### Zechariah 5:9 *and they had wings like the wings of a stork,* A stork is a large bird and common to describe the appearance of the women. 

#### Zechariah 5:9 *and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.* The ephah was lifted up. 

#### Zechariah 5:10 *I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"* This time, Zechariah didn't ask who these were or what the ephah was but where they were taking it. 

##### The ephah will be removed from the **land** of Israel, but where? 

### Zechariah 5:11 *Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar;* Wickedness will be carried away from the land of Israel to **Shinar**. 

#### The reference in the land of Shinar is to Babylonia. This was the land where man had first united in a universal rebellion against God. Genesis 10:10, 11:2, 11

##### Genesis 11:2, 4 *It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the **land of Shinar** and settled there..They said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and **a tower** whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."*

#### Zechariah 5:11 *and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal."* Once the temple is prepared, wickedness will have a fixed resting place as an **object** of worship. 

#### Babylon stands throughout Scripture for confusion in spiritual matters, for idolatry, for spiritual uncleanness. Revelation 17:3-5

##### Just like in the days of Nimrod, the people will once again unite under a common purpose to make a name for themselves and instead of scattering, they will flock together and build wickedness a house. [[25\]](#_ftn25)

####  The Lord is allowing evil to play its course. Wickedness will have her own temple and be set up to be worshipped. Her power will be great over the people to bring unity in two main areas: 

##### One common, forced religion. Revelation 13:12-15

##### One governmental, forced commerce. Revelation 13:16-17

####  The fulfillment of this vision must be future. It cannot be interpreted as referring to the exile to Babylon since they had already returned.

####  The city of Babylon will be made a perpetual desolation with nothing dwelling in it. This can never be said to have happened to Babylon. 

##### The city of Babylon was never been destroyed in the way God said it would be. [[26\]](#_ftn26)

##### Jeremiah foretold of Babylon's literal future destruction. Jeremiah 50-51 [[27\]](#_ftn27)

###### Jeremiah 51:62 *and say, 'You, O LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing dwelling in it, whether man or beast, but it will be a perpetual desolation.'*

##### When Medo-Persia overthrew Babylon, the city was never affected. 

##### Hundreds of years later, Alexander the Great stayed in Babylon. In fact, It is said that Alexander wanted to rebuild the Tower of Babel. 

####  Wickedness will become centralized as she sits on her pedestal in her house in Babylon (Shinar). She will continue her influence on the nations until Babylon is destroyed at the end of the Tribulation. Revelation 17-18

#### We will see the fulfillment of this in greater detail in Zechariah's second burden. 

## Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots

### **Zechariah 6:1-8 Judgment on the nations**

### Zechariah 6:1-3 The vision

#### Zechariah 6:1a *Now I lifted up my eyes again and **looked**, and behold, four chariots were coming forth*... Zechariah **looks** and he sees four chariots coming. 

##### Chariots typically were used in battle. These chariots are going out in a war-like fashion to **execute** judgment. Psalm 46:9

##### Chariots often symbolize **power** and authority. Psalm 20:7, Isaiah 66:15, Habakuk 3:8, Haggai 2:22

###### Some suggest the 4 chariots symbolize the 4 empires in Daniel. This seems unlikely. 

#### Zechariah 6:1b *from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.* The chariots came from between **two** mountains. Psalm 36:6

##### We are not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. There is no reason to think these mountains are not physical locations since the destination of the chariots are geographical locations, therefore the place of **origin** must be as well. Zechariah 6:8

##### It may be that the place of origin of the chariots are mount Zion and mount **olives** divided by the valley of Jehoshaphat. Zechariah 14:4 

###### The bronze in Scripture is often where God’s judgement deals with **sin**. Numbers 21:9, John 3, Revelation 1:15

###### The prophet Joel mentions the valley of Jehoshaphat in relation the judgment of the **nations**. Joel 3:2, 12

#### Zechariah 6:2-3 *With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.*..

####  earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three colors of horses. The meaning of the **horse** colors are not explained to us. 

##### Revelation 6 mentions horses of the same colors although they proceed in a different order. 

###### Red - takes peace, men slay one another. Symbolizes **war** and bloodshed

###### Black - often symbolizes **death** and famine

###### Strong dappled or grizzled - possibly **plagues**

###### White - often symbolizes **triumph** and victory. In Revelation 6 it refers to the Antichrist while in Zechariah it refers to God's agents claiming victory.

##### There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does **equate** to identity. 

### Zechariah 6:4-8 The Interpretation

#### This vision clearly shows how the Lord almighty is in control over sovereigns. It regards **divine** judgment on Gentile nations in relation to their poor treatment to Israel. Isaiah 66:15

#### Zechariah 6:4 *Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"* Zechariah wishes to know the **identity** of the horse pulled chariots. 

##### *what are these* - this was Zechariah's question regarding the vision with the horseman, the 4 horns, and the two olive trees. 

###### One day the same question will be asked regarding the Messiah's wounds between His arms. Zechariah 13:6 

### Zechariah 6:5 *The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,* The angel's answer refers to the question Zechariah **makes**. 

#### The Lord of all the earth - is a term used to describe the Lord as the sovereign of the earth. 

##### When Joshua crosses the Jordan to posess the land. Joshua 3:11, 13

##### When Israel is made strong and plunders the nations before the Millennium. Micah 4:13

#### The word spirits (RUACH) can be translated *breath, wind, or spirit* . There are some who say these are spirits and others who say they are angels. 

#### Do people carry these judgments out or are they angels? Arguments exist for both sides. 

##### Having been in the presence of the Lord (Sovereign) of all the earth, these four winds were His messengers, the executors of His will. Psalm 104:4, Hebrews 1:7

##### These are four spirits sent out before the Lord. Four spirits (winds) many **times** refers to divine judicial judgment. Daniel 7:2, Revelation 7:1

### Zechariah 6:6a *with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them,* One group of horses goes **north**. The other group goes south. 

##### Directions in Scripture are in relation to Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem is at the **center** (naval) of the earth according to God. Ezekiel 38:12, Ezekiel 5:5

###### Jewish tradition teaches that the center of Israel is Jerusalem. The center of Jerusalem is the Temple which has the holy place as its **center** which contains the ark in its center and in the center of the ark. [[28\]](#_ftn28)

###### There's a chunk of real estate the world community thinks peace will break out all over the Middle East. It's a dispute of a territory that they call the West Bank. Why is it called the West Bank in the east? When you use the expression West Bank, you're using a Jordanian mindset. [[29\]](#_ftn29)

#### Israel's enemies always attacked from the north or from the south. To the west of Jerusalem is the Mediteranean sea. To the east is an impassable **desert**. 

##### The black horses go north, the direction from which most of Israel's enemy invaders descended on the Promised Land. Jeremiah 1:14; 4:6; 6:22; Ezekiel 1:4

###### Babylon would have invaded Israel from the north. **South** of Israel is Egypt. Ezekiel 39:2

### Zechariah 6:6b-7a *while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. "When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth."* All the chariot **teams** seem eager to execute the command. 

##### Egypt lay to Israel's south, and it was another implacable enemy.

### Zechariah 6:7b *And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth.* The context calls for a broader scope than the land of Israel. This is a patrol sent to the whole earth. 

##### The reality is that the Lord of all the earth will execute judgment on all of Israel's **enemies**. 

#### Zechariah 6:8 *Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north..."* The Lord **now** responds to Zechariah as the vision plays out. 

##### It is possibly that verses 6 and 8 refer to Babylon. If this is the case, this is merely a temporary appeasement of God's wrath against Babylon since Babylon will be reserved for **judgment**. Zechariah 5:5-11, Revelation 17-18 

###### This would serve as an example of how God will take care of all of Israel’s enemies. 

#### Zechariah 6:8 *have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.* The black horses and white horses brought judgment upon the **land** of the north and appeased God's anger. 

#####  Since the chariots went in compass directions, we should probably understand their judgment to be universal. Zechariah 2:6; Jeremiah 49:36; Ezekiel 37:9; Revelation 7:1[[30\]](#_ftn30)

#####  While we see the wrath of God appeased in the north, we will also see Messiah at one point fighting in the south…

#### Zechariah 9:14 *Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south.*

##### Isaiah 63:1 Who is this who comes from Edom, With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah, This One who is majestic in His apparel, Marching in the greatness of His strength? "It is I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save."

##### Isaiah 63:2 Why is Your apparel red, And Your garments like the one who treads in the wine press?

##### Isaiah 63:3 "I have trodden the wine trough alone, And from the peoples there was no man with Me. I also trod them in My anger And trampled them in My wrath; And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments, And I stained all My raiment.

##### Isaiah 63:4 "For the day of vengeance was in My heart, And My year of redemption has come.

##### Isaiah 63:5 "I looked, and there was no one to help, And I was astonished and there was no one to uphold; So My own arm brought salvation to Me, And My wrath upheld Me.

##### Isaiah 63:6 "I trod down the peoples in My anger And made them drunk in My wrath, And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth."

####  This final vision presents several difficulties in its details, however the overall message is clear. God will have vengeance on **those** nations who have mistreated Israel. 

##### Zechariah’s vision assures us that God is in control of the future and will judge the Gentile nations during “the day of the Lord.”

####  Following the destruction of Israel’s enemies we will see Messiah usher in the 1000 year Kingdom. 

## Zechariah 6:9-15 The crowning of Joshua the priest

### In the vision in chapter three we saw the priestly line being reinstated and in chapter four we saw the royal line represented by Zerubbabel. Zechariah is told to have a crown made and hold a ceremony crowning the priest. 

### A priest was never to be crowned. A king was never allowed to serve as priest. These two offices were always distinct and separated by God. Only Levites served as priests. Only Judeites could be kings. 

#### This crown symbolically points ahead to Messiah who will serve in the capacity of priest and king. The two offices will unite in Him. 

### The eight, night visions have ended, but the coronation of Joshua is closely connected with these revelations which extend in scope from Zechariah's day to the full establishment of Israel in blessing.[[31\]](#_ftn31)

### Zechariah 6:9-10a *The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, "Take an offering from the exiles,* Zechariah was to receive a gift from a group of exiles who had arrived from Babylon. This is a prophetic word as well. The Lord informs Zechariah of a group of men (by name) and tells him where they have arrived. 

#### We will see this prophecy fulfilled that same day. The fulfilment of the prophecy was consistently literal. It was clearly as God had said it would be, Zechariah did not have to imagine what the prophecy meant to know the primary purpose. 

### Zechariah 6:10b *from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah;* Zechariah was instructed to receive an offering (not demand it) from these **exiles**. These men were gracious givers who wanted to contribute towards the temple building. Ezra 1:4, 6

#### While it was not Zechariah's job to receive offerings for the building project, God sends Zechariah to collect this special offering and will **give** it a singular purpose. 

### Zechariah 6:10b *and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.* God specifically tells Zechariah to go to a specific person's house and **meet** those men there. 

### Zechariah 6:11 *"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.* This calls the attention of the listener. Crown for a priest? This is strange, as you don't **crown** a priest.

#### *Crown* (ATARAH) here is **plural**. However, in verse 14 *crown* (ATARAH) it is singular. 

##### This ornate *crown* was to be made from out of several crowns.  Revelation 19:12

#### **Kings** were to be from the tribe of Judah while priests could only be from the tribe of Levi. Genesis 49:10

##### Jesus was from the tribe of Judah. How could He serve as priest? Because his order was of a different, higher one according to Melchizedek. Genesis 14:18, Hebrews 5:10

#### No king could serve in the office of priest and no priest could serve in the **office** as king.

##### Anybody that mixed the two **offices** of priest and king suffered terrible consequences. 

###### Saul - 1 Samuel 13 relates how king Saul tries to take on priestly duties to help. Though he was told he did it anyway and the consequence for doing it was that his kingdom was taken from him that **very** day. 

###### King Uzziah entered the temple of God to burn incense on the altar. Burning incense on the altar was something only the priests could do. Instantly, leprosy broke out on his forehead. 2 Chronicles 26:18-20

###### Jeroboam - as king took on the prerogative to add two other places of worship, at **Dan** and Bethel. Two things come into play here. He got involved in the office as priest but primarily he played with the lineage of kings, specifically the line of David. 1 Kings 12:26-31, 1 Kings 14:9, 1 Kings 11:32, 1 Kings 11:28-29

####  Joshua the high priest serves as a type of the Priest that will be crowned as king. To be warranted by God and the two offices joined in one **person** meant only one thing, this was referring to the Messiah. God's anointed servant, the Priest-King. 

####  Today, Christ is serving in the capacity of priest but is seated behind the veil on the Father's throne. 

##### Christ is not ruling as King. 

###### He has not been crowned yet. John 18:36, Revelation 1:12-18

###### Matthew 6:10 *Pray…thy kingdom come…on earth as it is in heaven*…

###### Jesus will one day change thrones from sitting next to the Father to sitting on His own throne. Revelation 3:21

###### He will one day **return** to earth to rule as King of the earth in the Millennial age. Zechariah 14:16-17 

####  Zechariah 6:12a *"Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch,* The **Branch** is a reference to a man’s name, He will be the Messiah. Zechariah 3:8; Isaiah 11:1, 53:2; Jeremiah 23:5; Jeremiah 33:14-18 

##### Prior to Jesus, The Aramaic Targum, the Jerusalem Talmud, and a Midrash all regarded verse 12 as messianic. [32](#_ftn32)

####  Zechariah 6:12b *for He will branch out from where He is;* After the identity of this **Man** is established to be Messiah, we now are told what He will do. 

##### This speaks of Messiah's very **humble** beginning when He comes. Isaiah 53:2, John 19:5 

##### In Zechariah 3:8 The Branch is introduced as the Lord's servant.

##### It’s a bit of a play on words. The shoot will shoot up from beneath (where there is little promise of life). [33](#_ftn33)

###### He will grow out into a beautiful thing. Isaiah 4:2

#### Zechariah 6:12c *and He will build the temple of the LORD.* Messiah, upon his second coming will build the fourth temple which will be **during** the Millennium. Ezekiel 40-46

##### Since the first temple was literal, we can **assume** the fourth temple will also be literal. 

###### The dimensions given for the fourth temple are literal and cannot be understood **unless** one takes it to be a physical temple with physical measurements. 

##### Zechariah presents this temple as distinct.

###### Zechariah consistently uses the word BAYIT (31 times) for temple or house throughout the book. 

###### The word for *temple* here is HEKAL (translated temple, naval or palace). See references where HEKAL is translated palace. 1 Kings 21:1, 2 Kings 20:18, Psalm 45:8, 15, 144:12, Proverbs 30:28, Isaiah 13:22, Isaiah 39:7, Hosea 8:14, Amos 8:3, Nahum 2:6

###### Zechariah switches to use the word HEKAL only in verses 12, 13, 14, 15 and 8:9 to describe the temple the Branch would build. Haggai 2:18

###### Zechariah 6:12 …will be built by the Branch…Malachi 3:1, 

###### Zechariah 6:13 …where His throne will be…Ezekiel 44:3

###### (ii Zechariah 6:14 …where the crown will be displayed as a reminder…

###### (iv)    Zechariah 6:15 …those far off would come to build…

###### (v)    Zechariah 8:9 …the prophets spoke beforehand it will be built…

###### From the usage of the word HEKAL in verses 12 through 15, Zechariah appears to distinguish the future temple from the second temple being built. 

###### Zechariah 8:9 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that **the foundation of the house*** BAYIT *of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that **the temple*** HEYKAL *might be built.*

###### Ezekiel also describes the Millennial temple using the word HEKAL. It would appear by his usage that the HEKAL is within the BAYIT. Ezekiel 41-42

###### This temple will not be built until after the Tribulation, at the beginning of the Millennium and will only be standing during that dispensation **since** Scripture tells us there is no physical temple in the Eternal State. Ezekiel 41:6-7, Revelation 21:22

###### Clearly this temple is meant to be understood as a physical structure, not spiritual (as some suggest) since the thrust of the Text is to describe with precision how the temple will be. 

###### We are given the temple’s exact measurements of the wall. Ezekiel 40:5

###### The measurements of the court. Ezekiel 40:47

###### The measurements of the sanctuary. Ezekiel 41:4

#### Zechariah 6:13a *"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor*...He will build the temple HEKAL and he will **bear** the honor...

##### While Zerubbabel was instrumental in building the second temple, he was did not receive the honor, God did. Zechariah 4:6-7

##### When **Jesus** builds the Millennial temple, He will receive all the honor for the building, as well as for who He is, King of all the earth. 

#### Zechariah 6:13b …*and sit and rule on His throne.* He will build the temple HEKAL and set up His **throne** in it. 

##### This speaks of two different roles. He sits and He rules. He sits as priest because of His finished redemptive work and rules as king from His **throne**. Revelation 3:20

##### The text makes it clear this is not a heavenly throne. In the heavenly throne scenes in the Bible, Messiah is sitting at the right hand of God's throne. Here we see Messiah will sit and rule **on** His (Messiah’s) thronPsalm 110:1-4

###### In Revelation 3:21 we see the two thrones, *…I will grant to him to sit down with Me on **My throne**, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on **His throne**.*

###### Architecturally, temple and throne belong together. The temple is a sacred palace; it houses God's throne. The Lord identifies the eschatological temple as "*the place of **my** throne*". Ezekiel 43:7[[34\]](#_ftn34)

##### The Branch's kingdom will be widespread. Furthermore, He will build the temple of Yahweh. Zerubbabel, not Joshua, was God's choice to build the restoration temple. (Zechariah 4:9-10) but Messiah, whom Joshua prefigured, would build the future temple for Yahweh. Isaiah 2:2-4; 56:6-7; Ezekiel 40—43; Micah 4:1-7; Haggai 2:6-9[[35\]](#_ftn35)

##### Cleary, Zechariah is telling us Jesus will one day build a particular temple in Jerusalem. It will be fitting for the greatest monarchy the world has ever seen. 

###### He will reign with justice and fairness. Jeremiah 23:5

###### He will reign with power. Psalm 2

###### His ministers are glorified church saints. Revelation 20:6

###### His subjugates will love him with all their heart. Jeremiah 31:33, 32:39

###### The Shekinah glory will return to this temple. Ezekiel 40-46

#### Zechariah 6:13c *Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."'* The Priest will not only reign on a throne, but His rule will be categorized by peace between the office of priest and office of king. The king will rule from His throne. This is the **Davidic** throne promised beforehand. 2 Samuel 7:12-16

##### Upon the merging of the two offices, Jesus will usher in world peace (**shalom**). 

###### He brings peace **with** God judicially.

###### He brings peace **of** God in the heart.

###### He brings physical, **world** peace.

#### Zechariah 6:14 *"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.*  This ornate crown of many crowns was to serve as a reminder of the gift of these men. 

##### *a reminder* could be translated a memorial. Exodus 12:14, Exodus 28:12

##### To be consistent with Zechariah’s usage of the word temple HEKAL would mean that the crown would one day serve as a reminder in the temple HEKAL (Millennial temple) to those who graciously donated for the making of it. 

###### These men graciously gave by faith as unto the Lord. 

###### They had to trust God because Zechariah would use it for a crown rather than towards financing the building. 

###### They had to God that one day a Priest would wear a crown.  This made no sense at the time. 

###### Their names remain recorded in Scripture but the ultimate fulfillment of this will be when those in the Millennium will be reminded of the importance of the foundational work done in building Zerubbabel’s temple. 

###### The rebuilding of the second temple may seem somewhat insignificant today, but to God it was very important, and that will be reflected one day in the future temple.

###### It also points to a greater fulfillment in the very Man, the Branch, who the **crown** is made for, the Priest-King, Messiah. 

###### The temple was never to be worshipped. The creator is to be worshipped. Colossians 1:16-17

#### Zechariah 6:15a *"Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD."* Jeremiah 31:10

##### Those who are far off may be referring to the scattered people of Israel who will come to **build** the Millennial temple. 

##### Isaiah also speaks of the coming of gentile nations to the temple in Jerusalem during the Millennium: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD'S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it”. Isaiah 2:2, 56:6-7 [^77]

###### In the Millennium, when the Kingdom is being built, the first thing people will do is **come** together to Jerusalem and build the temple. Zechariah 2:11, 8:22, Isaiah 2:2-4; 56:6-7; 60:1-7

###### The Church however is commanded to **go** into all the world to build His Church. Matthew 28:19-20

#### Zechariah 6:15b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.* Notice how important it is to God that they should know these things. God, in all his greatness and incomprehensible glory, reveals Himself to man in perceivable, palpable ways. 

#### Zechariah 6:15c *And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.* Acts 2:39

##### The taking place of these things (the memorial crown serving as a reminder in the future temple) would only take place if Zechariah and the Jewish remnant kept the covenant. We know this condition will not be kept until the time of the end when Israel is saved.

##### The statement “if you completely obey the Lord your God” reminds us of Deuteronomy 28. 

###### Deuteronomy 28:1 *"Now it shall be, if you diligently obey the LORD your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.*

###### Deuteronomy 28:2 *"All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you obey the LORD your God:*

# IV. Zechariah 7-8 - The Third Message: Four Admonitions

## A.  Zechariah 7:1-14 A misunderstanding of “return to me”

### After the 8 visions, Zechariah now continues the theme of the book, returning to the Lord. 14 months have passed since Zechariah preached his **first** message to return to Him. Haggai 2:12-16

### As it happens, the people decided to take up national fasts to remember the first temple, the destruction of Jerusalem and other important events. 

#### They had been faithfully mourning for 70 years and the town of Bethel sent a **group** of people to Jerusalem to ask the priests how much longer they should continue their fasts. 

### The people, especially the older generation, missed Solomon's temple, the glory days of Jerusalem and the way things used to me. 

### Their theological understanding of returning is about returning to when things were better. They were mistaken to focus on the historical blessings instead of the **giver** of the blessings. Their **trust** was focused on returning to those "glory" days. Jeremiah 7:4

#### Their reason for seeking God was that His blessings would return, not because they were desirous to return to **Him**. 

#### The next **two** chapters deals with clarifying this misunderstanding. 

#### First, God will show them the error of their thinking. Then, He will show them **where** (or who) their faith should be placed on. 

### Zechariah 7:1 *In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.* 14 months had passed between Zechariah's first message and this **third** one. 

### Zechariah 7:2 *Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,* In response to Zechariah’s message, the concerned town of Bethel sent a delegation to seek the favor of the Lord. 

#### Bethel means house of God, probably about 12 miles north of Jerusalem. 

##### At the time of writing, Bethel was part of Judah, not **Samaria**. Ezra 2:28

#### Regemelech and Sharezer are Assyrian names. 

##### Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king's spokesman. If this is the same man, perhaps he had some governmental **authority**. 

##### We don't see Regemmelech mentioned again in Scripture. However a man named Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father, the **Assyrian** king Sennacherib, and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38

###### Esarhaddon began to **reign** in place of his father, Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37

###### Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, "*Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.*" Ezra 4:2

##### Were these **men** Regemmelech and Sharezer and their men sent to merely "appease" God?

###### Bethel had a long history of syncretistic faith. It was at Bethel that Jeconiah set up a **calf** to be worshipped so that the people would not go down to Jerusalem to worship. 

### Zechariah 7:3a *speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain,*

#### Perhaps these men were very sincere in their belief that their abstaining of food and weeping was pleasing to God. 

### Zechariah 7:3b *as I have done these many years?*" This was something they had practiced over and over every year, every time the date **come** up. 

### The second temple was destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus the Roman. It was destroyed on the 9th day of the 5th month which is the **same** day Nebuchadnezzar burned down the first temple in 586b.C. 

#### Today the Jews commemorate this day with fasting and morning. Instead of returning to the Lord, the religious Jews **want** God to give them a temple so as to return their religious activities. No wonder God does not answer this prayer. 

### **Word of the Lord #1** - Addressing a **wrong** concept of repentance

#### Zechariah 7:4-5 *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, "Say to all the people of the land and to the priests...'* Zechariah as priest and prophet receives the word of the Lord telling him communicate it to the people, including the **priests**.

##### Evidently everyone needed to hear the following admonition from the Lord. 

#### Zechariah 7:4-5 *When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years...* for 7 decades they had religiously carried out these fasts. 

##### They fasted and mourned four major events 

###### The fast of the **fifth** month was remembering when Solomon's temple was **burned** by Nebuchadnezzar in 586b.C. 2 Kings 25:8

###### The fast of the **seventh** month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to **flee** to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25

###### Fasts were also held in the **fourth** and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2

##### These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They were self-imposed by the people and held throughout the **years** of Babylonian captivity. 

##### The question being brought before the prophets and priests seems sincere. God's answer will **reveal** they have a problem. 

###### Perhaps many grew up practicing these ceremonies and presumed they should just continue. Many traditions are carried on by future generations without ever questioning. 

#### Through this series of 4 messages, God will **show** them the crisis in their thinking in order to pleade with this generation of post-exile jews to change their thinking and return to Him by faith. 

### Zechariah 7:5b *...was it actually for Me that you fasted?* They answer they receive is a question. The Lord Jesus often used this technique to make people think. 

#### The question was **not**:

##### Who started the fast? Perhaps some important person began this and carried down the ranks. That would make the fast important. 

##### When were they started? The circumstances they were started under would reflect their great suffering. 

##### How many people attend? To know that everybody practiced them would confirm the authenticity. 

##### Where do you fast? Perhaps, once the temple was built, they would be able to carry on in the temple courts?

#### Instead, the question asked was regarding the authenticity of it.  For what reason did you fast? God’s question is, did you do it for me? 

##### It seemed to them, that maybe God was questioning their sincerity. Perhaps He didn’t realize all that went into prohibitions and weeping for endless hours. It was hard work, only the truest Jews would carry them out all the way. 

##### Perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting to commemorate the **loss** of the temple among others. Nobody bothered to ask, “what does God say about it?” 

##### Certainly, the ritualistic weeping had an appearance of spirituality. Surely God would be impressed and be moved to show **mercy**? Isaiah 39:13

#### In the minds of the people, especially the younger generation, it was a practice they had always done. They grew up doing it. It was normal to do it. Perhaps if the question was, "**why** do you fast?", the answer would have been, "because we've always done so...". 

####  God goes beyond the “why” question and moves to make them question something deeper, did you consider Me when doing it? Was it me you were after? Was I the **intent** of your heart? 

##### They were missing the point by asking if they should continue or not. They evidently presumed that what they did was right. Somehow, they appear to think that their fasting almost caused their **return** to the land. Now that God has favored them, should they continue? 

###### Maybe if they were to go on, they would get an extra added blessing? 

####  God makes them question, **why** had they done it in the first place? Isaiah 58:3-8

##### Motivation for these particular fastings were not for God. Neither did God ever tell them they should be **done**.

####  The prophet Jeremiah's conclusion as he lamented the destruction of Jerusalem is contrasted their mourning. Though he was incredibly **sad**, his hope was in the Lord not on better days. Lamentations 5:21, 3:21-23

####  Today, Christians do things out of **habit** or even worse, because of habit in the name of God, thinking they must be done because they have been practiced for decades. Perhaps we should ask ourselves why we do what we do. Is it really out of gratitude for God that we do it or are we seeking something in return?  

#### forgetting the reality behind the ritual is hanging on to an empty ritual. There is a mighty power in tradition to **blind** people from reality. Mark 7:13

#### One day in the future, all of Israel **will** weep, not for loosing out on some blessings or as a means to commemorate better days, but the day they realize it was them that had pierced their own Deliverer and Messiah. Zechariah 12:10-14

##### This is the day the nation of Israel will repent (change their minds) and place their faith in Jesus the Messiah to receive the forgiveness of sins through His finished work on the **cross**. Oh what a blessed day that will be! A glad reunion between a nation and their God. 

#### Zechariah’s first message was to return to the Lord, not return to remember better days or return to hope for times of prosperity. 

##### True, Biblical Repentance

###### One of the greatest misunderstandings of the Bible today centers around the understanding of what repentance is. In order to inspire what they consider to be repentance, many are teaching a Gospel of **works**. "Clean up your life and you will be saved", "have you truly mourned for your sin?", "turn from your sin and be saved". 

###### What was needed for Israel to be restored? To return to God. A simple turning from what they were trusting in (idolatry) to once again **trust** God. 

###### God is richly revealing His goodness, forbearance and long-suffering to lead people **turn** to Him. That is, to change their minds from what they are believing to believing in Him. Romans 2:4

###### Some teachings of "**grace**" essentially promote a sense of rebellion against the law of God. Grace is not contrary to the law, it is contrary to legalism. These false understandings end up promoting the believer with a license to sin. 

###### Legalism seeks to find God's favour either for justification or sanctification by means of law keeping. It is possible to see the Christian **life** as keeping with external morality, however God would question us, did you do it for Me? 

###### Grace teaches us Christ as the means to walk with God. Grace gives us the correct motivation of a thankful **heart**.

###### In Christ the believer **upholds** and agrees with the law in, never rebelling against it. 

###### On the contrary, God is never in favour of legalism. Legalism springs from self-righteousness and a complete misunderstanding of God's **perfect** righteousness and man's depravity. 

###### The Christian is never encouraged to walk independent of God. Quite the opposite, God works all things together towards his/her utlimate **good**, for a life in total dependancy upon God. Isaiah 66:2, John 15:5, 19, Romans 8:32-33, Psalm 40:16-17

###### Matthew 6:16 *"Whenever you fast, do not put on a gloomy face as the hypocrites do, for they neglect their appearance so that they will be noticed by men when they are fasting. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.*

###### Matthew 6:17 *"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face*

###### Matthew 6:18 *so that your fasting will not be noticed by men, but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.* 

###### Their theological understanding of what repentance meant needed to be challenged. They were more **upset** about the effects than the cause. To them, a return meant mourning over the evil that resulted in order to make the good return. 

###### Their concept of returning to God was an issue of how **they** were affected not what God said. The very reason they were taken out of the land was not a series of mishaps but because God had said their total disregard for Him would lead to their demise. 

###### Isaiah 30:15 *For thus the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said, "In repentance and rest you shall be saved, In quietness and trust is your strength." But you were not willing,*

#### Zechariah 7:6 *'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?* In a similar fashion to their fasting (ceasing from any **food**), eating and drinking is done without considering God but for mere physical supplement. We do it for self-preservation or personal enjoyment. 

##### Whether we eat or don't **eat** makes little difference before God if our relationship with Him is estranged. They were not closer or farther to God by eating for themselves. 

#### Zechariah 7:7 *'Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'*" This is not a new message they had never heard before. 

##### God says through Zechariah, I’m saying now what I said through prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos to the previous generations. This generation was on their way to repeating exactly same thing. The circumstances might be a little different but the message is exactly the same because their thinking was exactly the same. 

##### The reason they were sent into exile in the first place, the reason the glorious days were over, was their own fault for not trusting the Lord. God had said through the prophets that it would happen if they did not listen. 

##### Amos 4:6 "*But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

##### Amos 4:7 *"Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up.*

##### Amos 4:8 *"So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

##### Amos 4:9 *"I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

##### Amos 4:10 *"I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

##### Amos 4:11 *"I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

##### The question demonstrates the way the people thought. They lamented over the consequences for decades but had not considered even for a moment that it was their disobedience to the covenant that caused them in the first place. 

##### It did not seem to enter their minds that the real crisis was that they were estranged with God. This really didn't bother them. What bothered them is keeping the memory alive. 

##### Their thinking dictated that if they would felt sorry enough, sad enough, if they truly lamented their condition, God would see them in their lamentable state and feel pity.

##### This is an example of a self-righteous approach and comes from a faulty understanding of God's absolute righteousness. The only way to approach God is God's way through God's provision. 

####  Just like the fasting in those days was not for God, today's Christian activities can be godless while having a certain spiritual look appeal to them. Colossians 2:20-23

### **Word of the Lord #2** - Showing the cause; failure to walk by faith

### Zechariah 7:8-9 ***Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,\*** *"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;* God takes the nation back to a right perspective according to the covenant, not according to their own ideas. 

#### They had willingly entered this covenant with God. 

##### If Israel kept the law, God said He would bless them. However, when Israel did not hold to their part of the covenant, God was obligated to curse them. 

##### God did not exile them for not being perfect but rather for their failure to turn to Him because of their failure to keep the covenant. 

##### Failure to listen means they were so intent on keeping the law they failed to be instructed on how God meant them to carry it out. The law was really meant to show them inadequacy so they would look to Him as they failed. 

#### This verse is not teaching in favour of modern day "social justice". The law was in place to protect the oppressed, not to force "equality" on everyone. 

#### By putting things in perspective of the Mosaic law, the idea is that they would realize their error.

##### Were they dispensing fairness? 

##### Were they showing brotherly kindness and compassion? 

##### The 10 Commandments numbers 1 through 4 related to God, while commandments 6 through 10 related to man. 

###### Administration of justice was to be according to truth.

### 16. Zechariah 7:10a *and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor*; James, the epistle written to Jews says, these are the marks of true religion. James 1:27

#### Morning lost benefits caused by ones own sin is just empty ritualism, not true religion. 

##### Instead, they had been neglecting and oppressing the most vulnerable in the nation. 

#### A stranger (GER) was a legal, non-jew living in the land. Ruth the Moabite, was an example of a stranger in the land. 

### 17. Zechariah 7:10b *and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.*' Their hearts were against one another therefore they devised evil. They tried to take advantage of each other for personal profit.  Proverbs 4:23

### 18. Zechariah 7:11 "*But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.* This served as an instruction to this generation. Refusing to listen to God comes at inevitable consequences. 

#### Two examples are given to illustrate their refusal to listen

#### *Turned a stubborn shoulder –* This is likened to a stubborn ox who refuses the yoke. Nehemiah 9:29 

##### Still the messengers of the Lord pleaded with them.

#### *Stopped their ears from hearing* –like a child plugs his ears so as not to hear. Deuteronomy 8:20, Isaiah 33:15, Isaiah 6:10, Jeremiah 7:26

##### Their indifference to God's word is what caused the 70-year exile. 

### 19. Zechariah 7:12a "*They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts…*

#### Flint is a very hard stone used for cutting and piercing things. A heart like flint is one like an adamant stone, hard and cannot receive God's word. Matthew 13:3-9

#### These people hardened their hearts, and they became deaf to God’s word. They could no longer hear out of choice, not because God removed the ability to hear. 

##### This might be difficult for you to image could happen to you but given time and a constant indifference to the conscience and to the voice of the Spirit, one becomes cold, indifferent and far, one gets to the point He cannot hear God’s word. Jeremiah 22:21

### 20. Zechariah 7:12a *…had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets;* Acts 6:8-15

#### Zechariah is the first to record this doctrine of the Spirit. It was the Spirit that prompted the prophets to speak. 

#### The Lord of hosts words were sent by The Spirit of God. The Jew considered the person of the Spirit precious, yet they refused to listen to Him through the people He sent. Acts 7:51-53

##### They found themselves in opposition against the Law and the word of God. 

##### When Stephen reminded the first century Jews about this, and they stoned him. Acts 7:54-60

##### For such continued disobedience, there could be but one result, and this was great wrath from the Lord. The greatness of the wrath can be seen in the great punishment inflicted. 2 Chronicles 36:16[12](#_ftn36)

#### Zechariah 7:12b-13 *therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.* They did not keep the covenant, so in keeping with the agreement, the wrath of God came. Did they return to God when they realized this? Unfortunately, no. 

##### For over 1000 years the Scriptures had been warning them of this. Deuteronomy 28:49-50

##### It is easy to misunderstand God's wrath is brought on due to His relationship being cut off with His people. It is a faith issue, not perfection issue. 

##### The sacrificial system was set up for this reason.

##### When God's people don't walk as they should, that is, trusting in Him, in His ways, listening to what He has to say, then God will turn to other methods to capture the attention of His people. 

###### The good news is that for the believer in the Church age, we no longer fear the wrath of God, yet that does not mean He will not discipline those he loves. Hebrews 11:5

#### Zechariah 7:12b-13 *"And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;* God reverses the situation. For countless times God had been calling out to them, now they get to see what it's like when God doesn't listen. Isaiah 28:12, Proverbs 28:9, Isaiah 1:15

##### When a relationship is cut off, communication is cut off as a result. 

#### When communication is cut off, the relationship is cut off. 

#### While the people seemed to be fine without God, they ignored him. When troubles came however, they called out to God for help and in turn, God did not listen to them. 

##### Would they miss the point of God's not answering their call? 

##### This does not mean God was playing "the silent game”.  

####  Did they call out to God because they realized they needed Him or because they wanted to be delivered of the situation? Micah 3:4

##### Had God had helped them get what they desired; would it have helped the relationship?  James 4:3

#### Zechariah 7:14a "*but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known.* God's ways are perfect. He wanted their ultimate good. Since they were not in a condition to listen, He sent them into different directions where they were no longer together in the land. 

##### Perhaps then they would seek his face?

##### Since they wanted to be like the rest of the nations, God does exactly that. He scatters them to the nations. 1 Samuel 8:5

##### So much of Israel's custom revolved around the land, Jerusalem and the temple. These were given to them by God to serve as reminders of who He was. Yet now, in a strange land they had nothing except God Himself. 

##### Would they turn to God to trust Him? Or mourn for the loss of these things? 

##### *Storm Wind…* it was as though a windstorm had blown them off the Promised Land. Deuteronomy 28:36-37, 64-68; Hosea 13:3

#### Zechariah 7:14b *Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate."* Deuteronomy 28:41- 42, 45-52

##### The pleasant land turned into desolation was due to the sin of the people. Psalm 106:24; Jeremiah 3:19; Daniel 11:16, 41

###### The land was made to rest. Rest from Israel's abuse to it but mostly, God removed them away from the land so by being alone in a strange land they might turn to God in faith. 

##### The point being made is clear. The reason they were exiled, the reason Jerusalem and the temple was destroyed was due to their incapacity to keep the covenant, not because they had not kept a certain self-appointed fast. 

##### It's good that the priests had to be receiving this message too. They were a major part of the problem and their teaching needed to encourage a return to the Lord. 

##### In light of this, their question seems so very insignificant, and it should encourage these men from Bethel and anyone else to repent (change their minds) and return to the Lord. 

#### It may seem that Zechariah has gone on a rabbit trail and forgot the question that was asked. On the contrary, God is using the prophet to repeat what He had been saying all along, their condition is not new but even more, God had been explaining the crux of the problem. 

##### In essence, outward form of religious activity alone was lifeless unless it was accompanied by a heart of worship directed to God. 

## Zechariah 8:1-23 - 7 promises concerning Jerusalem. The Faith perspective

### **Word of the Lord #3** – 7 promises concerning Jerusalem

#### Almost half of the occurrences of the Lord of hosts occur in chapter 8 when He makes over 8 promises regarding the future He has prepared for Jerusalem. 

#### **Promise #1**, The Lord will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem

##### Zechariah 8:1-2 ***Then the word of the LORD of hosts came\****, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.'* Zechariah 1:14-16

###### Zion can have different nuances in Scripture

###### Zion is used many times interchangeably with Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 5:7, Isaiah 40:9, Psalm 87:2-3

###### Zion can also refer to the people of Israel. Isaiah 60:14, Isaiah 52:1

###### Hebrews used Zion in a figurative sense to speak of the New Jerusalem. Hebrews 12:22

###### Zion can mean the holy mountain upon which Christ will reign from. Psalm 2:6, Psalm 132:13

###### In this context, Zion appears to refer to the God’s people, Israel. Zechariah 1:14

##### Zechariah 8:3a "*Thus says the LORD, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.* Jerusalem is the only city that God says He will make his holy habitation. 

###### This will come about during the Millennial Kingdom when Israel is a believing nation.

#### **Promise #2**, Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth

##### Zechariah 8:3b *Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,…* when God will come to dwell among the people, people will call Jerusalem the City of Truth. 

####  **Promise #3** The mountain of Jerusalem will be called Holy Mountain

##### Zechariah 8:3c *and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.*' Jerusalem is referred to as *Sodom in Egypt* during the Tribulation. Revelation 11:8 

###### Jerusalem today is a place of conflict. The temple mount is divided. 

###### There’s no reason to say the Mountain is Holy, rather just a place for religious Jews to wail at the temple base, crying for a return of the temple. 

###### Sounds like not much has changed from Zechariah’s generation. 

###### However, when Messiah dwells in her midst Jerusalem will stand for all that is right and truZion will be called a Holy Mountain.

####  **Promise #4**, Jerusalem will have complete peace and safety

##### Zechariah 8:4-5 "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age. 'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.*' The elderly and the young (the most vulnerable people groups) will be safe and will not be afraid. 

###### Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem to the ground leaving the young and the old lying on the ground. The older generation would remember seeing this. God says he will turn it around. Lamentations 2:21

####  **Promise #5**, The Jews will be regathered from around the world to Jerusalem 

##### Zechariah 8:6 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts.* 

###### When God announces restoration, it may seem improbable but that is what is going to happen. Genesis 18:14

##### Zechariah 8:7-8b *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west;* 

###### Obviously east and west implies more than just Babylon. This is a worldwide return. 

##### Zechariah 8:8b *and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem;* initially this is only a physical return. This sets the stage for discipline during the Tribulation. 2 Peter 3:10 

##### Zechariah 8:8c *and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.*' This refers to more than just a physical return; this is when Israel will return to the Lord! Isaiah 66:8, Zechariah 12:10

###### This sets the stage for the blessings of the Millennial Kingdom. 

###### Under the Mosaic covenant, Israel would be God's special people among the nations if they kept their part. That is, they would be a nation who reflected God and God would bless them before the Gentile nations. 

###### Therefore, while the Jews are in exile, they are not God's nation. They do not reflect God as a nation, nor do we see God blessing them in the land of promise. 

###### This in no way affects the Abrahamic covenant given 600 years prior that declared them as a nation to be God's possession. This was an unconditional covenant and promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants. 

###### So even though the Jews are in exile, they are still his people and His promises to them still hold true. 

###### Exodus 19:5 *'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, **then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples**, for all the earth is Mine.*

###### Though Israel had not walked with God, there would be a time when Israel could be counted as the people of God among the nations if they kept the covenant conditions. This will come about because God will give them a new heart and the Spirit of God will dwell in them to empower them to walk as they should. 

##### Zechariah 8:9 "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong,* in light of these precious promises, God invites Zechariah’s generation to strengthen their hands to the work of the temple rebuilding. 

##### Zechariah 8:9 *you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.* pay attention to the prophets who told you to get busy rebuilding the temple. 

###### Two of these were Zechariah and Haggai. Zechariah 2:12, Ezra 5:1, 6:14

##### Zechariah 8:10 '*For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.* There were political, economic problems. Haggai 1:3-6

###### They worked hard and had nothing to show for it. God had caused the political and economic problems. 

##### Zechariah 8:11 '*But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts.* 

###### God has changed his disposition. The invitation is one to confidently approach God to find mercy and grace. 

####  **Promise #6**, The land will be a blessing and yield fruit

##### Zechariah 8:12a *'For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew;* Deuteronomy 28:1-14 Quoting by way of blessing if they went back to the Mosaic covenant. Matthew 6:33

###### Israel had experienced times of cursing in the land, times of discipline away from the land. This speaks of a time of great blessing in the land. 

##### Zechariah 8:12b *and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.* 

###### Notice how God is actively making this to come about. Believing Israel "the remnant" will have as an inheritance all of these things. Not by their doing or by their sacrifice but because God causes it to come to pass for those who believe in Him. 

###### In other words, God is saying that when they were focused on their homes, economy, politics, etc. God made it harder for them. 

###### However, now as they focus on the temple, God would supply all their needs in abundance. Matthew 6:33

#### **Promise #7**, Israel will become a blessing to the nations

##### Zechariah 8:13a *'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing…*

##### Zechariah 8:13b *…Do not fear; let your hands be strong.'* Do not fear, trust me! 

###### *Fear not* appears 365 times in the Bible and twice within these 8 promises. Zechariah 8:15

###### How do you stop being afraid? Trust God's promises. Zechariah 8:14-15

###### Again, he says, let you hand be strong. In other words, trust me, let Me make your hands strong! James 5:8, Philippians 4:13, Ephesians 3:16, Colossians 1:11

###### In just the same measure that Israel has been a stigma among the Gentile nations, God will turn it around. He will reunite the houses (people) of Judah and Israel. They will be one nation under God. He will deliver them and they will no longer be a curse but a blessing to the other nations. 

###### God told them this so that they would take courage. They could find strength in this future promise. 

#### Zechariah 8:14-15 *"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented*, God purposed to bring harm against His people. Why? Because God relentlessly held them to the covenant they had entered with God. God never quit upholding His part. 

###### God disciplines those He loves. He is relentless because he loves His people. Hebrews 12:5

##### Zechariah 8:15b *so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!* With that same relentless passion, God says he has purposed to do good to the city of Jerusalem and His people. Malachi 3:8-11, Jeremiah 29:11

###### Just like there were clauses regarding cursing in the covenant, there were clauses regarding obedience that resulted in blessings. Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 26

###### Once again, he reiterates, do not fear. God says, "when you trust me, you have nothing to fear!" Proverbs 28:1, 

###### In a similar sense, for the church age, we have nothing to fear when we trust God! 2 Timothy 1:7

#### How then should you live? Based on those marvelous promises and what lies ahead for you, God says, you should keep the covenant. 

##### Zechariah 8:16 '*These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment*

###### Because of who they were, because of their association with God as a people, the natural course of action should be to reflect God in their dealings with one another. 

###### As a community, they should be truth tellers within the assembly of the believing. 

###### They were to be people of judgment. They should make judgments according to truth. Deuteronomy 13:1-5, 

###### We aren't to judge regarding people's motives. And we aren't to judge hypocritically. Matthew 7:1-6

##### Zechariah 8:16b *for peace in your gates.* They were to be people who promote peace. Primarily with each other. 

##### Zechariah 8:17 '*Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another,* Zechariah 7:10 

###### *Heart sins*: These are sins committed in the heart. 

###### beware! private thoughts will eventually lead to public actions. Proverbs 4:23 

###### 500 years before Jesus, Zechariah was instructing against heart sins. Matthew 5-7

##### Zechariah 8:17 *and do not love perjury;*" Loving to lie is something the Lord detests. False weights are an example of what this is talking about. Jeremiah 5:30-31

###### The treatment they had for each other was reflective of who they had as God. Love for one another and being honest were two key points in the Mosaic covenant. 

###### Swearing by God's name and lying were probably strategies of business learned from their time in Babylon. They went from farming to commerce. 

###### They learned to take advantage of their neighbor (telling them untruths) and used God (using God's name in vain) to legitimize business. Matthew 5:33-37

###### These two sum up the two aspects of the law. 4 laws were regarding their relationship with God and 6 dealt with their interaction with fellow man. 

###### This did not reflect God's ways established for Israel. 

###### Regarding false prophets, though they are more at fault, it does not mean the people were innocent. The people wanted to hear things they liked. If the people would judge according to truth, false teaching would dry up. 

###### In a similar way today, there would be no business for false teachers if the people of God would judge according to truth. 

##### Zechariah 8:17 *for all these are what I hate, declares the LORD*. God is a God who loves, but He says there are things He hates. 

###### Haughty eyes, 

###### lying tongue (perjury), 

###### hands that shed innocent blood,

###### a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness (perjury), 

###### one who spreads strife among the brothers (seek peace). 

###### Jesus also is quoted saying he hates the sin of the Nicolaitans. This was something that a group of people were teaching. Possibly a teaching that promoted laity-clergy distinction. Revelation 2:6

### **Word of the Lord #4** – Morning into joy, the nations will seek the favor of the Lord

#### Zechariah now ends this 4 part admonition showing the incredible blessings these men had as Jews because they had wonderful and amazing promises given to them from the Lord of Hosts. 

##### One day the nations will come and desire what the Jews have

##### They will see the joy in Jerusalem and come to seek the favor of the Lord!

#### God will turn their mourning into gladness

##### Zechariah 8:18-19a ***Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,\*** *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months*...Four fasts were held every year commemorating the byproduct of their sin. Would those seekers from Bethel realize this? 

###### Religion thrives on ceremony. The greater the number of rituals, the higher the religion. 

###### Religion must of needs highlight the problem but only the God of the Bible provides full and complete restitution by grace. 

##### Zechariah 8:19b *...will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah;* The pharisees walked around with sad faces because that was the image of spirituality. 

###### While mourning results from man’s work, overflowing joy comes from God’s work. 

###### True spirituality is God's complete provision in Christ. One response is characteristic to Him who experiences the spirituality that comes from Christ - turns mourning into joy, gladness and cheerful feasting! Psalm 30:11 

###### Israel will one day experience this with God, when by faith they return to Him. Zephaniah 3:14-20

##### Zechariah 8:19b *so love truth and peace.*' Rather than focusing on mourning their losses, they should focus on loving truth and peace because they had a God who spoke truth and was the God of peace. 

###### The nations of the world seek peace. Yet it is at the cost of truth. Unless there is true justice, truth divides, therefore the nations of the world are willing to do away with truth to establish "world unity" and "peace". 

##### Zechariah 8:20 *Thus says the LORD of hosts,' It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities.* As a result, the Gentiles will come pouring in. 

###### This prophesies a crowd coming from cities will come. Honor and popularity will be returned to Jerusalem as the capital. There will be unity among the people. Israel and Judah will be united as one nation. The cities speaks of the cities of Israel. 

##### Zechariah 8:21 *'The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go."* We get the sense of urgency and priority people have, "let us go at once" to seek the favor of the Lord. 

###### This is how the conversation had begun...the men from Bethel were seeking the favor of the Lord. 

##### Zechariah 8:22 '*So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.'* The people of many nations come to Jerusalem. The fulfilment of this will be when Jesus is reigning in the city of Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:16-18

###### Why do people come to go to Jerusalem? Because that is where Jesus is. 

#### The Jerusalem will be blessing to the Gentiles

##### Zechariah 8:23 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for **we have heard** that God is with you."'"* This is Israel being God's people and God being their God. 

###### In the kingdom, 10 gentiles will grab the garment of one jew to ask him to take them to Jerusalem to seek the Lord. 

###### The center of the world will be Jerusalem because Jesus will be there. Isaiah 49:22-23, Deuteronomy 28:13

###### God's blessing upon the Jews will be undeniable. People of all nations will recognize the God of the Jews and seek to find favor with Him through the access available to the Jew. 

###### This was God's purpose with the nation of Israel from the beginning. They were to be a light unto the Gentiles. They were to be a vessel of pointing the way to God. 

###### Interestingly, after Satan is released from the abyss after 1000 years, he immediately attacks Jerusalem. Revelation 20:9

###### These future promises were to encourage the returnees in the present. 

###### For the believer today, the Church also has many wonderful promises for the future which are to impress on us in the present. They are separate and unique for the Church. 

###### Is it not wonderful that the promises God made to Israel remain intact and one day will come to fruition just like He said it would? 

###### Christian, does that not affirm the promises God’s word has stated for you? 

# Zechariah 9:1-14:21 - The Fourth Message: The Two Burdens

## Zechariah 9:1-14:21 The Two Burdens of the Lord

### The following 5 chapters were probably written later in Zechariah's ministry. 

#### Many skeptics have tried to discredit the authenticity of chapters 9-14 saying it is not the same author as the first 8 chapters. However, these arguments are untenable and can be refuted. 

##### One argument is the difference in style. However, style of writing is not a conclusive argument for different authorship because it can change under different circumstances. 

###### What is different? One difference is the temple is now standing. We know this because Zechariah acts out several charades in the temple. 

#### Chapters 9-11 have to do with foretelling how Messiah will come and offer them a return to Yahweh and to set up His kingdom. 

##### Matthew 4:17 *From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."*

##### Zechariah foretells they will not only reject Messiah’s offer, but they will also pierce Him.

##### Chapters 9 and 10 explain prophetically the time period when Israel was subjugated under Greece. 

##### Chapter 11 foretells when she is under Roman domination. 

##### Israel rejected this offer but out of that rejection God will create a new administration inclusive of the Gentiles.

###### During this time, God will not work around one nation but through a new assembly, an organism composed of Jews and Gentiles known as The Church of Jesus Christ. Romans 9:25-29

###### God temporarily changed his focus from building a nation to building a spiritual gathering because of Israel's persistent unbelief. Romans 9:30-33

###### The Jews that believe during the timeframe of the Church are included in the Church. Sadly, by and large Jews continue rejecting to return to the Lord. 

##### Chapters 12-14 have to do with foretelling how God will not postpone the promised blessings due to Israel's return to the Lord. 

## Zechariah 9:1-11:17 The First Burden

### Zechariah 9:1-17 The Poem of the King

### **Zechariah 9:1-8 Setting the scene for the arrival of the King**

#### Zechariah 9:1-7 God, as Sovereign uses a vassal Macedonian king, Alexander to bring Judgement of the oppressive nations surrounding Israel, preparing the way for God's Messiah. 

#### Zechariah 9:1a *The burden of the word of the LORD…*

##### Generally speaking, a burden is something God puts on somebody's **heart**. 1 Corinthians 9:16, Jeremiah 20:9

##### The word burden (MASSA) in connection to prophecy should be understood as a catastrophic judgment imposed on the prophet to be discharged with a **sense** of urgency. Zechariah 12:1, Malachi 1:1, Isaiah 13:1

#### Zechariah 9:1b *is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place...* The **city** of Hadrach no longer exists but has been It has been identified as Hattarika, a city in Syria mentioned several times in the cuneiform inscriptions. 

##### Damascus was the capital city of Syria. 

##### After the battle of Issus in 333b.C., Alexander the Great was quickly moving south towards Egypt. He went conquering from north to south beginning in Syria, then Phoenicia, Philistia and then to Egypt.

###### Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of **Syria**. 

###### Tyrus and Sidon are principal cities of **Phoenicia**

###### Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of **Philistia**.

##### After the attack, Syria never regained native rule. 

####  Zechariah 9:1 *(for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD).* This would mean all the people were watching what God was doing through His instrument, Alexander. 

##### This verse could also be **translated** *"for the Lord has his eyes upon men and upon the tribes of Israel...*" Zechariah 1:8

###### The Lord sees all and considers everything and **executes** judgment and blessing accordingly. Proverbs 15:3

###### Verse 8 says…*For now I have seen with My eyes*.

####  Zechariah 9:2a *And Hamath also, which borders on it;* Amos 6:2, 2 Kings 25:18-21

##### Hamath is the third city of Syria that is mentioned. 

##### It was in the land of Hamath that the captain of Nebuchadnezzar’s guard, had many officers of Judah killed. 2 Kings 25:18-21

####  Zechariah 9:2b *Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.* Next, Alexander moved to cities in the land of Lebanon. Ezekiel 28:12-17

##### Though Tyre and **Sidon** are wise, they cannot escape God’s judgment. 

##### These cities were *wise* in their own **eyes**. Ezekiel 28:3-5, Proverbs 3:7

####  Zechariah 9:3 *For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.* Their trust was in economic **power**. Their wealth was piled up. James 5:3

##### Tyre had built a fortress to protect its wealth. Her **trust** (built herself) is in piled up riches. Joshua 19:29

###### Tyre was an important commercial city with a **great** port that was thought to be impossible to conquer. Isaiah 23

###### Tyre was built on an island and highly fortified. It had a surrounding wall of 150 (46 meters) high. [[36\]](#_ftn37)

###### The Assyrians laid siege against Tyre for **5** years but never conquered the city. 

###### Nebuchadnezzar tried to conquer Tyre for **13** years. Isaiah 23:4, Ezekiel 29:18

#### Zechariah 9:4 *Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.* We are reminded it is the Lord who is behind Alexander. Tyre and her wealth will be plundered. 

#### This is not an ominous prophecy. Years in advance, Zechariah foretells that Tyre will fall. Her wealth will be thrown into the sea, and she will be burned. Others predicted this as well. Amos 1:9-10, Isaiah 23, Ezekiel 26

###### Within 7 months, Alexander took the **city** of Tyre and burned it to the ground. Ezekiel 26:4-12, 27:27

###### The nations saw this and **feared**. Ezekiel 27

#### Zechariah 9:5-7 - Philistia es **conquered**

#### Zechariah 9:5a *Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.* Ashkelon sees what has occurred to Tyre and it causes them to fear. Joshua 13:3, 1 Samuel 6:17

##### It was Ashkelon that historically caused God's people to be **afraid**. Ezekiel 25:15-17

###### *…see it and be afraid* in Hebrew is a **play** on words, *TERE* and *TIRA*.

#### Zechariah 9:5b *Gaza too will writhe in great pain;* She inflicted pain on Israel, now she will suffer pain. 

##### Alexander sieged Gaza and after a few months it was taken. 

#### Zechariah 9:5c *Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded.* We are uncertain what her expectation might have been but it would be put to shame. 

#### Zechariah 9:5d *Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza,* it is said by a contemporary of Alexander that the king of Gaza was brought to him and he had him tied to a chariot and dragged around the city until he died. 

#### Zechariah 9:5e *and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.* The people feared and fled and after Alexander passed through, the city never regained it’s population. 

#### Zechariah 9:6a *And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod,* God destroyed the cities and people and mixed them with a hybrid people. It may have been Alexander’s **policy** to mix the conquered peoples with each other. 

#### Zechariah 9:6b *And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.* Jeremiah 25:20, Amos 1:6-8, Zephaniah 2:4-7, 1 Peter 5:5, Proverbs 16:18, Zechariah 9:7

#### Zechariah 9:7 *And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth.* Philistine pagan rituals involved drinking **blood**. It refers to idolatry. 

#### Zechariah 9:7b *Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah,* There will be a remnant of believers among the Philistines. Ezekiel 33:25

#### Zechariah 9:7c *And Ekron like a Jebusite*. When David conquered Jerusalem the Jebusites inhabited the **city**. David let them live and they were incorporated into Israel, Ekron will be same. 2 Samuel 24:16, 1 Chronicles 21:18

#### Zechariah 9:8 *But I will camp around My house because of an army,* While God is judging the surrounding nations, He is also protecting Israel. 

##### Just like God used Alexander to level Israel’s enemies, God will now protect Israel. 

#### Zechariah 9:8 *Because of him who passes by and returns;* This was fulfilled about 200 **years** later in 333b.C. when Alexander miraculously refrained from destroying Jerusalem. 

##### Even though Alexander passed by Israel more than once, he never harmed it. 

##### According to the historian Josephus, after Alexander took Gaza, he made his way quickly to Jerusalem. When the high priest heard this he ordered that the people should cry out to **God** and ask for protection.[[37\]](#_ftn38) 

###### At that time the high priest had a dream where he was told to take courage, adorn the city and open the gates and that the people should appear in **white** garments and that all the priests should wear their priestly garments.[[38\]](#_ftn39)

###### According to the dream the priest prepared as the dream said, and waited for Alexander. When Alexander saw them, everybody was in white and the high **priest** in purple, Alexander approached by himself and fell before the high priest. 

###### Later on, when asked why he had adored the priest, Alexander said, "I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit...and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and **destroy** the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind."[[39\]](#_ftn40)

#### Zechariah 9:8 *And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, for now I have seen with My eyes.* Zechariah 9:1, Jeremiah 16:17, Isaiah 60:18, Ezekiel 28:24 

##### 300 years before Jesus came, God would use a Macedonian king named Alexander the Great to judge surrounding nations. The Greek language and culture became popularized throughout the world. This will set the scene for Messiah's arrival.

### **Zechariah 9:9 – Behold! The King of Righteousness**

#### Zechariah 9:9 *Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!* This is perhaps the most known verse of Zechariah. The daughter of Zion is called to rejoice greatly, to shout in triumph! 

#### It was fulfilled during **Palm** Sunday about 2000 years ago, about 500 years after it was written. Zephaniah 3:15

##### There were two major reasons for rejoicing. 

###### First, the king was coming. Zechariah 9:9

###### Second, he would set up His kingdom. Zechariah 9:10

###### What people did not see at the time, is that the entire church age lies between verse 9 and verse 10. 

#### Zechariah 9:9a *Behold, your king is coming to you;* Zechariah announced the coming of *Melech Yisrael*!

##### From other prophecies, Israel knew that God would raise up a king who would deliver them from their enemies and usher in world peace. 

##### God wanted a king for Israel. He just had a certain kind of king in mind, not the **kind** Israel desired. Acts 13:22

###### God wanted a king that was unlike pagan nations. A king that was just, righteous, **faithful** and good, one who recognized God as sovereign and he would act as earthly regent. Deuteronomy 17:14-20

###### An important phase in the historical development of Israelite kingship was Yahweh's promise, delivered through the Prophet Nathan, that the Davidic dynasty would remain forever. 2 Samuel 7:8–16, 1 Chronicles 17:7–14; Psalm 87 88:3–5, 20–38 

###### This assertion was the basis of future eschatological hopes for a new kingdom and an ideal king, and in this regard also Israelite kingship differed radically from the kingship patterns of Egypt and Mesopotamia.[[40\]](#_ftn41)

##### The king the **people** wanted was ***like the other nations\***. 1 Samuel 8:4-6

####  Zechariah 9:9b *He is just and endowed with salvation,* a just king equipped with deliverance! 

##### Salvation is spiritual peace with God. Isaiah 45:21, 53:11, Jeremiah 23:5-6, Malachi 4:2

##### Why wasn't the kingdom established upon His first visitation? 

###### It was not because they did not want to **enthrone** the Messiah. John 6:15, Romans 9:33

###### They had wanted to enthrone Jesus by force did He not **permit** them. John 6:15

###### What the people did not understand is that in order for Him to reign as their Messiah **King**, they needed to return to the Lord first! Jeremiah 24:7, Malachi 3:7, 2 Chronicles 7:14

###### It will not be the people of **Israel** who enthrone the Messiah but God will do so after He has removed all His enemies. Psalm 110:1-4

##### Zechariah 9:9 is part of a larger unit that anticipates a time in which the people of Yahweh’s perennial adversaries will be pacified and humiliated and Philistia incorporated within it. Zechariah 9:1-8 [39](#_ftn42)

##### The king whose advent Jeremiah and Ezekiel also looked forward to is described according to ideal specifications. He will be strong to save and lowly and unassuming at the same time. Jeremiah 23:5, Ezekiel 34:23-31[[41\]](#_ftn43)

####  Zechariah 9:9c *Humble, and mounted on a donkey,* unlike Alexander, God in human flesh came to earth and chose to be born in a manger and **rode** into the nation’s capital, Jerusalem, on a donkey. Luke 2:7

##### Why wouldn't Jesus make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding a **horse**? Clearly the point is made regarding his humility, but is there more? 

###### There are over 188 mentions of horses in the Bible.

###### Israel, specifically the kings, were not supposed to have horses. The reason is stated in the law. Judges 12:14, 2 Samuel 16:2, 1 Kings 1:33

###### Deuteronomy 17:15-16a *you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses...“But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses**…*

###### God told the Israelite kings not to have horses so that they would not be prone to return once **again** to Egypt. Egypt was the primary provider of horses at the time. Deuteronomy 17:16b

###### When God delivered Israel from Egypt, he wanted them to make a clean break so they wouldn't have any reason to ever want to **return**. If Israel was not to return to Egypt, they must not trade with Egypt in any form. 

###### Though it is not stated “no horses whatsoever” it is certainly implied. 

##### When the the decalog prohibits coveting, it makes no mention of horses yet it **names** oxen and donkeys. Surely horses must be more desirable than donkeys...Exodus 20:17

##### Archeological digs have found that all the nations in the area had horses but not **Israel**, that is, not until the time of Solomon in 970b.C. and that was out of disobedience. 1 Kings 10:26

###### Solomon had 40000 stalls for horses and 12000 horsemen. His horses are emphasized. 2 Chronicles 1:16-17

###### Remember how God said they trade with Egypt if they got into horses? When Solomon disobeyed and got horses anyway, that’s exactly what happened…

###### 1 Kings 10:28 *Also Solomon's import of horses was from **Egypt** and Kue, and the king's merchants procured them from Kue for a price.* 1 Kings 10:26-29

##### Knowing that Israel was not to deal in horses, passages like Psalm 20:7- 9 make a lot more **sense**. 

###### Psalm 20:7-9 *Some boast in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.* *They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright.* *Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.*

##### God did not want the people of Israel to conquer the land trusting in **horses** and chariots but in God. Zechariah 10:5

###### David's triumphs are really a testimony that God conquered the **land** for them. Psalm 18:39-50

###### Proverbs 21:31, *“The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but deliverance is of the Lord.”*

###### By forbidding the Jewish state to acquire horses, God assured that the Israelites would be forced to fight defensive battles to protect the territory of the Holy Land that the Lord had given to them. [[42\]](#_ftn44)

###### When the people returned from Babylon, they brought with them 736 horses. This speaks of the people's condition after 70 years in a foreign land. 

###### The had adopted new practices from the Chaldeans and were breaking the covenant. Ezra 2:66, Nehemiah 7:68

##### Therefore, in keeping with the law, and true to his righteous character, when Jesus entered Jerusalem **riding** on what is possibly a fine-bread donkey. What a magnificent entrance in keeping with everything God says and does! 

###### Jesus made no exceptions when dealing with Himself in His first coming. He **came** under the law not to abolish or rebel against it but to fulfill it. 

###### All four gospels quote this verse as being **fulfilled** upon the triumphal entering into Jerusalem. Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19

###### On the outskirts of town people followed Jesus crying, "*Hosanna to the Son of David...*", 

###### However, many in the **city** of Jerusalem had no idea who He was. 

###### Matthew 21:10 *And when He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "**Who is this**?".* Matthew 21:1-10

###### Matthew 21:15 *But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," **they became indignant,*** 

##### The people wanted a king like the other nations that offered political sovereignty and national identity (i.e. liberation from the Romans). When the leaders of Israel realized that they had better chances of getting political power with Rome they yelled, "*we have no **king** but Caesar*". John 19:15

###### The people stumbled over Jesus. The kingdom of God is more than mere politics. Entrance to the Kingdom requires absolute righteousness. This was Jesus' **offer** to them. Matthew 5-7 

####  Zechariah 9:9d *Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey...*a donkey's colt was a purebred donkey, one born of a female donkey rather than one born of a mule. This made it be qualified to be a royal mount. [[43\]](#_ftn45)

##### Christ's lowliness in outward condition reflects His inward disposition. The **donkey** is seen as the animal of peace. Genesis 49:11

##### The four Gospels include this event. 

###### Mark 11:7 They brought **the colt** to Jesus and put their coats on it; and He sat on it.

###### Luke 19:35 They brought **it** to Jesus, and they threw their coats on the colt and put Jesus on it.

###### John and Matthew make a point of quoting this passage in Zechariah...

###### John 12:15 *"FEAR NOT, DAUGHTER OF ZION; BEHOLD, YOUR KING IS COMING, SEATED ON A DONKEY'S COLT."* John 12:14

###### Matthew 21:5 *"SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'"* Matthew 21:4

### **Zechariah 9:10 The King of peace**

#### The people of Israel had suffered for hundreds of years under the oppressive hands of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medo-Persians, under Greece and upon the Kings arrival, they were under Rome's oppressive **rule**. 

#### Zechariah 9:10a *I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim...* Ephraim here represents the **land** of the northern kingdom of Israel. Genesis 48:8-22

##### The chariot was almost exclusively used in battle. Since Israel didn't have chariots, this refers to the removal of war caused by gentile peoples in the land of Israel. Leviticus 26:6, Joshua 9:15

#### Zechariah 9:10b *And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations;* Jesus will return as a conqueror **going** out to war then bring in peace. Psalm 72:8

##### This may be what the Horseman on the red horse in chapter one is willing to go and do. Just like the patrol returned saying there was peace on the earth while Israel suffered, now, the Angel of the Lord, The Messiah himself will go out against the nations that went against Israel and bring in true lasting peace upon the whole earth. Zechariah 1:8-17

##### Isaiah 2:4 *And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.*

###### The United Nations has tried to appropriate this verse taking on a Messianic role. Ironically, there have been more than 150 wars since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. This is far from bringing in peace. 

##### It was through a series of battles that Jacob had acquired possession of the land and it has been battle after battle for Israel ever since. 

##### This would bring great hope to a people who have experienced war since they arrived on the land. This will happen when God's King, the Messiah will reign, *He will speak peace to the nations*. 

###### peace is the word shalom. 

###### Jesus will put down all warfare and strife. The chariot, the horse and the battle bow as representing weapons of warfare. he will remove all these and bring in world Shalom. 

###### Jesus came in humility, for a time He stooped down lower than the angels, became a man, offered himself as God's humble yet sufficient sacrificial provision for Israel's true return, His offer was peace, true peace, eternal peace with God. 

####  Zechariah 9:10c *And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.*

##### *Earth* is the word (ERETS) which could be translated land, however since the definite article is not in the Hebrew we understand it is not referring to the land of Israel but rather the earth, referring to a worldwide kingdom. Psalm 72:8, Psalm 22:27-28

##### When Jesus returns to the earth, he will bring world peace in justice and truth. To be specific, will reign from sea to sea. 

##### John says that in the eternal state there is no sea, this therefore must be speaking of a future reign after Zechariah's time and before the eternal state. 

###### We know this will be fulfilled during the 1000 Millennial Kingdom which is after the Tribulation and before the eternal state. Revelation 20:4-6

###### The entire time period between Zechariah 9:9 and 9:10 was previously unseen by Old Testament prophets. 

###### This is why the Qumram arrived at the conclusion that there would be two Messiahs. Their names were Ben-Joseph and the second Messiah would be Ben-David. They believed there would be two different Messiahs. Why? Because they did not have Paul's writings explaining the mystery of the church. 

###### Today, thanks to Paul's teachings, we know it to be the church age. 1 Peter 1:10-11

##### Isaiah 9:6a *For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;* This portion was fulfilled on the first coming, but the second part of the verse has over 2000 years in between. 

##### The second portion of the prophecy in this verse has yet to be fulfilled... 

###### Isaiah 9:6b *And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.*

###### Isaiah 9:7 *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom,* To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. 

##### Today God is using the church to cause the Jews to be jealous of what they missed on Christ's first coming. Romans 11:11, 14

##### The church will spend 7 years in Heaven. However, then *they* (the church) *will reign upon the earth*...this is a literal 1000 year reign on the earth from Jerusalem. 

##### Revelation 5:10 *"And Thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth."*

### **Zechariah 9:11 The King of faithfulness**

#### Zechariah 9:11a *As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you,...* the reason for the following is given, it is because of the blood which ratifies God’s covenant with Israel. 

##### In order for a covenant to be firm, it had to be ratified in blood. Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 26:28, Psalm 105:7-11

###### When a covenant was made, customarily, both parties passed between the parts of cut up animals. While they walked through the parties would declare that the same should happen to them if they break their covenant. 

###### When God made a covenant to Abraham. It was a special ceremony because God did walked through the cut animals Himself while Abraham slept. God made a unilateral covenant without any involvement or requirement on behalf of Israel, Abraham's descendants. 

##### Previously we saw a covenant to the peoples which dealt with God's holding the nations at bay to not allow them to annihilate the people of Israel. 

##### This covenant however is far greater in its scope and fulfillment. It is referring to a covenant God made to Abraham. Genesis 15:9-12, 18-20, 

###### This is a description of the wonderful things God will do for Israel because of his promise to her. Israel, like no other nation in the world has a covenant that God made with them. Genesis 5:9-10

###### God made many covenants throughout Scripture. They all kept a similar pattern. God promised he would make it, He ratified it, He clarified it, and then He fulfilled it. 

##### The Abrahamic covenant has three major parts. Land, seed, and blessing. Genesis 12:1-3

###### Abrahamic covenant – was an unconditional covenant God made with Himself to Abraham. Genesis 12, 15, 17

###### **Promised**: Genesis 12:1-3

###### **Ratified**: Genesis 15:12-17

###### **Clarified**: Genesis 17:1-18

###### **Fulfilled**: Complete fulfillment will not be until the Messianic Kingdom. Revelation 20-22, Hebrews 11:9-10, Ezekiel 36:22-30

###### The **land** covenant is an expansion of the land aspect of the Abrahamic covenant. Genesis 13:14-17, Deuteronomy 28-30

###### The **Davidic** covenant is an expansion of the seed aspect. 2 Samuel 23:5

###### The **New Covenant** is in connection to the blessing part of the Abrahamic covenant. 

###### New Covenant **Promised**: It may surprise you to know that the New Covenant was promised long before the church even existed. It was promised to Israel and to Judah. Jeremiah 31:31-34, Hebrews 8:8

###### New Covenant **Ratified**: Jesus’s blood served to ratify the covenant. What a guarantee that God will never go back on His promises if the blood of His son is given in vail!  Matthew 26:27-28, Luke 22:20

###### New Covenant **Clarified**: Hebrews 8:9-13, 9:15, 12:24

###### New Covenant **Fulfilled**: Ezekiel 36:22-30, Romans 11:25-29

###### How does the Church then relate to the New Covenant? Paul said it clearest,  [God]… *made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life*. 2 Corinthians 3:6

###### God has incorporated the Church into Israel’s promises by making us ministers or servants of the New Covenant. One day the Church will rule and reign with Christ when the New Covenant is fulfilled in the Messianic Kingdom. 

##### God keeps His promises (covenant) **because** of the blood…though Israel rejected their Messiah, God’s deliverer, and remain to this day in a state of rebellion, God will be faithful to His promise because of the blood, His Son’s blood that was shed. 

###### If Judah didn’t believe in God’s faithful character, they should trust the blood shed of the covenant. Perhaps Zechariah’s generation was thinking of the blood of the Mosaic covenant, which serves as a type of the blood of the lamb of God. Exodus 24:3-8, 29:38-46; Mark 14:24, John 1:29

###### God has not discarded Israel or the plans He has for Israel. He has not replaced one single promise He has made to the church. Each and every promise God made to Israel will be kept at the right time because God is faithful to the blood of the covenant. Praise God for His faithfulness! Ezekiel 36:22

###### On the other hand, if God did not keep His promises to Israel based on their failures, what chance do we have of Him keeping His promises to us? 

###### Thanks be to God, that is not the case as we are saved by grace and not of ourselves, salvation is the work of God. 

#### Zechariah 9:11b *...I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.*.. Luke 16:24, restoration of those still in Babylon because of his covenant with them. 

##### Cisterns without water were sometimes used as prisons. Genesis 37:24, Jeremiah 38:6

###### One cannot get out of a waterless pit themselves unless someone rescues them. Genesis 37:23-28

##### Based on the context waterless pit is not to be taken literally but metaphorically. 

###### The people of Zechariah’s time were not prisoners of Babylon. Those who stayed behind was because they found it preferable to stay. 

###### Therefore, the prisoners are those enslaved by sin. 

###### Luke 4:18 *"the spirit of the lord is upon me, because he anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor. he has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free those who are oppressed,*

### **Zechariah 9:12 The fortress King**

#### Zechariah 9:12a *Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope;* God calls them to return to the stronghold, namely Himself. Psalm 18:2, 31:2, 62:2; Jeremiah 16:19; Nahum 1:7

#### Zechariah 9:12b *This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.* When God gets them out of the pit, He promises to double whatever they had before. Isaiah 61:7

##### Job was granted double after his trials. Job did not know what God was going to do. Job 42

##### Exodus 12:17 'You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on **this very day** I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore, you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance. 

##### Daniel 8:21-25, 11:23-35 

### **Zechariah 9:13 The warrior King**

#### Zechariah 9:13a *For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim.* This image of a bow and arrow refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together as God's bow and arrow prepared for battle. Genesis 48:19

##### Since we know Israel and Judah have not been united since Zechariah’s time, we can say this has not occurred yet. It must refer to sometime in the future. 

###### “The entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country [Media]; wherefore there are but two tribes [Judah and Benjamin] in Asia and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers” [[44\]](#_ftn46)

#### Zechariah 9:13b *And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece;* Daniel 11:30

##### The word Greece here adds some difficulty to the passage. Many scholars believe these verses refer to the Maccabean revolution that took from 167 to 160 b.C. when the tyrannical king Antiochus “Epiphanes” IV was in power. 

###### It is true that the prophet Daniel referred to this man as typifying the Antichrist. Daniel 11:21-35

###### The timeframe of Zechariah 9:1-8 is when Greece is quickly coming into being the world power when Alexander the Great conquered Syria, Phoenicia and Philistia and was headed to Egypt. 

###### We are told God was behind this in order to prepare the way for Messiah’s coming. 

###### The world became united under one common language, Gree

###### Messiah’s arrival was not when Greece was in power but when Rome was. 

###### Therefore, in the immediate context to be writing a poem of divine conquest and preparation for the Messiah (around the time of Greece), then refer to the quality and characteristics of the Messiah and His coming (time of Rome) to jump back to the time of Greece to then jump back to refer to Israel in the days of her physical regathering (Rome) when Messiah has returns seems unlikely. 

##### Zechariah does not say Greece but “*sons of Greece*”. Who might the sons of Greece be?

###### The simplest way to understand sons of Greece YAVAN in Hebrew, refers to the Hellenization of the people. The influence Greek culture and language had on people was vast and permeated all peoples, even the Jews. 

###### Greeks refer to themselves as “Έλληνες”— Hellenes. The word “Greek” comes from the Latin “Graeci”, and through Roman influence became the common root of the word for Greek people and culture in most languages.[[45\]](#_ftn47)

###### The Greek teacher, Isocrates, in the 4th Century B.C. said, “And if a man should partake of our culture, let him be called Hellene” 

###### (ii Therefore, Greece (Latin) is YAVAN (Hebrew) which is HELLENE (Greek).  

###### Greek influence can be seen in forms of government. Humanistic viewpoint is largely based on Greek thought.  Greece has dominated subsequent European thinking and culture. 

###### The sons of Greece then, would be referring to the peoples of the world.

##### The sons of Zion battle the sons of Greece is saying the Jews go to battle against the world. 

### **Zechariah 9:14 The King of power** 

#### Zechariah 9:13c-14a *And I will make you like a warrior's sword. Then the LORD will appear over them,* 

##### Zechariah 12:1–9 teaches that there will be one last battle before Jesus establishes His kingdom, as the Gentile armies attack Jerusalem. But the Lord will use Judah as His bow and Ephraim as His arrow and defeat all His enemies[[46\]](#_ftn48)

#### Zechariah 9:14b *And His arrow will go forth like lightning.*

##### This refers to the Lord when He comes at the end of the tribulation. 

###### Matthew 24:27 *"For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.*

#### Zechariah 9:14c *And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet,* this is not the rapture at the last trump. God has more than one trumpet sound. This is a trumpet for Israel. 

####  Zechariah 9:14d *And will march in the storm winds of the south.* Psalm 18:7–15 and Habakkuk 3:3–15

##### storm winds of the south - God has been known to create the whirlwinds. Job 1:19

### **Zechariah 9:15 The King of safety**

#### Zechariah 9:15a *The LORD of hosts will defend them.* God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord of Hosts is He who defends them against their enemies. Psalm 27:10 

#### Zechariah 9:15b *And they will devour and trample on the sling stones;* no weapon formed against God will prosper. Isaiah 54:17

##### Rather the people trample on the sling stones used as weapons in war. 1 Samuel 25:29

##### They would trample on the sling stones (v. 15) used in warfare, and would become precious stones in the King's crown (v. 16). 

#### Zechariah 9:15c *And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine;* they are not drunk from drinking wine, rather they are celebrating from “drinking” the blood of their enemies. 

####  Zechariah 9:15d *And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,* *Drenched like the corners of the altar.* They will be “*filled to the brim*” just like the bowls were filled from the sacrificial blood of the altar. Leviticus 4:6-7 

### **Zechariah 9:16 The King of salvation**

#### Zechariah 9:16a *And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people;* The image of the people changes from being an army to a flock. God goes from being a warrior defending them to a shepherd who delivers them. 

#### Zechariah 9:16b *For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.* 

##### They trample on the sling stones then become stones in the crown of the king.

### **Zechariah 9:17 The King who will bring prosperity**

#### Zechariah 9:17a *For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs!* 

##### These are the covenant blessings that will come to Israel when she returns to the Lord. Deuteronomy 28:1-14



##### Israel will no longer be despised but will be an attractive nation. People will want what the Jews have. 



#### Zechariah 9:17b *Grain will make the young men flourish,* *and new wine the virgins.* This is when God will give them double in the land as He promised. Zechariah 9:12

#### Because Israel as a nation rejected their Messiah, that is, they didn’t trust in him as the promised delivered, these promises were not fulfilled at the time of His coming. 

## Zechariah 10:1-12 Poem of the wandering flock



### **Zechariah 10:1-2 The flock without a shepherd**

#### During Israel's periods of idolatry (Hosea 4) she ascribed fertility to Ba'al (Canaanite storm and fertility god) and not to YHWH. Chapter 10 highlights this grave mistake. Jeremiah 14:22, Zechariah 14:17[[47\]](#_ftn49)

#### Zechariah 10:1a *Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain* – drought was in the land due to the people not keeping the covenant. Therefore they should go to the Lord to request rain. 

##### The springtime is an important time for the rains because farming depends on it. 

##### People were evidently putting their hopes in other things (idolatry, good luck charms, diviners) to provide their needs, ie rain. Zechariah 10:2

###### Droughts on the land came about because of their wrong relationship with the Lord. 



###### rain is symbolic of blessing or prosperity. No rain in Israel is a sign of cursing. 



##### Spring is when they sow their seed. This is important to planting season. Joel 2:23

#### Zechariah 10:1b *The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man.* why ask God for rain? Because he is the one who makes the clouds to rain. Job 36:27-28



##### Why would there be no rain? Jeremiah 14:22, Joel 2:23-27



####  Zechariah 10:2a *For the teraphim speak iniquity,*



##### The teraphim can refer to many different idols. They were generally household gods used for divination, probably shaped like human beings. Judges 17:4-5, 1 Samuel 19:13, 16



##### The idolatry in the land, the household idols, came into their homes and people were looking to these idols for provision instead of God. 



####  Zechariah 10:2a *And the diviners see lying visions…*the visions were lies*.* Deuteronomy 18:14, Jeremiah 27:9, Jeremiah 29:8, Micah 3:7



####  Zechariah 10:2a *And tell false dreams;* The dreams they told were not true, they certainly were not from God. Jeremiah 23:32

####  Zechariah 10:2b *They comfort in vain.* The diviners gave them a sense of comfort, yet it was not according to reality. Job 21:34, Jeremiah 6:13-14, Jeremiah 37:19

##### The diviners don’t have control over the ability to rain. Telling someone it will rain soon made them feel good but it was in vain. 



#### Zechariah 10:2b *Therefore the people wander like sheep,* Though they provide an immediate feeling of comfort, it is in vain because it was not based on reality. Acts 19:19

##### They became a superstitious people, full of good luck charms and no need for God. 



#### Zechariah 10:2c *They are afflicted,* As long as these people were clinging to this idolatry, they were wandering like sheep. In fact, they were afflicteZechariah 11:7, Numbers 27:17, Ezekiel 34:5, Jeremiah 50:6



##### Why consult God when you can get your palm read? It provided instant gratification. 



##### Why consult God when you have a god for that? A god that gets you what you want-even if it’s not good. 



##### The people were consulting demons or learning doctrines of demons and being 'guided' by this. They were wandering aimlessly. 

##### Saul lost his kingdom because he consulted mediums. 

#### Zechariah 10:2c *because there is no shepherd.* It does not say there was no religious leader. There was no one who cared for the flock. 

##### Sheep aimlessly wander without a shepherd. A shepherd leads to water, leads to grass for food. A shepherd protects and keep the sheep safe. Psalm 23

##### Just like sheep without a shepherd are sheep lying in wait to be preyed on, so too the nation of Israel was open season for tragedy. 

###### The people were commanded to listen to the priests. Exodus 28:30, Leviticus 8:8, Ezra 2:63

### **The hired hands obstruct the flock owner (Judah is God’s flock, cradle of Messiah)**

#### Zechariah 10:3a *"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats;* Ezekiel 34:17

##### Instead of being shepherds, the leaders are likened to male goats, who are worthy of blame for what has occurred. They are hired hands and don’t care for the sheep. Ezekiel 34:1-10; 1 Samuel 28:3-7; 1 Kings 16:31, 22:6-12; 2 Kings 1:2, 16:15, 21:6, John 10:1, 10, 12-13


#### Zechariah 10:3b *For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah,* 

##### As sheep become restless, they wander, now the Lord of Hosts has come. He will comfort the flock. John 10:11, 

##### Matthew 9:36 *Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.* Isaiah 61:1, Isaiah 49:13, Luke 19:10

#### Zechariah 10:3c *And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.* The Lord will turn wandering sheep into His majestic war horse. 

##### God is into the recycling business. He takes things that are of no use and gives them a wonderful purpose.

####  Zechariah 10:4a *"From them will come the cornerstone,* the leader (Messiah) who would stabilize the nation would come from the house of Judah. Judges 20:2, 1 Samuel 14:38, Isaiah 19:13, 1 Corinthians 3:11, Isaiah 28:16, Zechariah 3:9

####  Zechariah 10:4b *From them the tent peg,* out of Judah comes one that will serve like a nail on the wall of a tent. 

##### The tent peg refers to the large peg in an Oriental tent on which were hung many valuables.[[48\]](#_ftn50)

##### On Christ people can confidently hang their hope. Isaiah 22:23-24, John 10:28-29, Luke 19:48

####  Zechariah 10:4c *From them the bow of battle,* Israel will be made into a bow in His hands. Messiah is a mighty warrior; He will never lose a battle. Exodus 15:3-4, Isaiah 63:1-6

####  Zechariah 10:4d *From them every ruler, all of them together.* Psalm 45:4-5, Psalm 2

#### Zechariah 10:5a *"They will be as mighty men,* *Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle;* *And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them;* What a contrast between Israel under the leadership of fleecing shepherds and God. They go from being useless and purposeless to being firmly established. Psalm 1

##### First, He makes them like adorned horses for battle, then he turns them into His bow and then makes them mighty men of battle. 



##### When Jesus comes, He will be coming as a warrior and they are His weapons. 

#### Zechariah 10:5d *And the riders on horses will be put to shame.* The Gentiles are those with horses. They will not be able to stand against the people of God. Ezekiel 38:4, Daniel 11:40



#### Zechariah 10:6a *"I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back,* God will be the source of strength of Judah and Israel will be rescued, God will gather them back into the land. 



##### God is working on the nation, even though it was separated at the time. The house of Judah is the southern kingdom which was already in the land. The house Joseph (also Ephraim) represents the northern kingdom of Israel which was scattered among the nations.



##### This verse is stating the reunion of the political union of the tribes of the north with the tribes of the south. 



##### Today the 10 tribes are scattered around the world. They appear to be spread out around the earth. Yet when this occurs, God will gather them from where they are and gather them to the land. 



#### Zechariah 10:6b *Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them,* when God has made all things right, it will be as if Israel had never been scattered. 



##### God demonstrates his compassion with Israel even after their many rejections of Him. 

##### No words can describe the compassion God has for Israel. Even more, is to think of the omniscient God who chooses to forget their sin. 



#### Zechariah 10:6c *For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.* What a day that will be, when Israel at last recognizes the one who they pierced and place their trust in Him! 

##### When as a believing nation they call on their God, He comes in response. 



#### Zechariah 10:7a "*Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad* those who were shepherd-less, wandering and weak from idolatry, will become strong because God is their strength. 

##### Ephraim (north) was the son of Joseph but he was later adopted by Jacob to be one of the heirs. Genesis 49:22-26, Judges 1:22-23



##### Though Assyria came and overtook and scattered the northern tribes, God will one day bring them back and make them mighty. 



##### This would have occurred when Jesus offered peace with God. Since it was rejected, it has been postponed until they do return to the Lord. 

###### Gladness came as a result of becoming receptors of God’s grace. Their hearts will be glad. 



#### Zechariah 10:7b *as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.* The blessing is such that it will be as if they had never been cast off. 



#### Zechariah 10:8a "*I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them;* as a Shepherd's whistle or a beekeeper's call they are beckoned by God. Isaiah 7:18



##### This illustrates what the Lord will do and the people of Israel will gather to Him. John 10:27-28



#### Zechariah 10:8b *And they will be as numerous as they were before.* The land of Israel will be a time of prosperity before the division of the kingdom at the end of Solomon's reign.



#### Zechariah 10:9a "*When I scatter them among the peoples,*



##### This is not Babylon alone since Assyria and Egypt are mentioned later. It is referring to a plural number of people of Israel’s worldwide scattering. 



#### Zechariah 10:9b *They will remember Me in far countries,* one day Israel will remember their roots and from all over the world will return to the land. We are already starting to see this in our day! 



##### We are reminded Zechariah's name means God remembers. 



#### Zechariah 10:9c *And they with their children will live and come back.* Not the present generation but sometime in the future. Their return is to Israel (come back). This is a geographical return to Israel. 



#### Zechariah 10:10a *"I will bring them back from the land of Egypt and gather them from Assyria.* Isaiah 11:11



#### Zechariah 10:10b *And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon* 



##### They will be brought to Gilead is east of the Jordan in the land of Israel. 



#### Zechariah 10:10c *Until no room can be found for them.*



#### Zechariah 10:11a *"And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea,* 



#### Zechariah 10:11b *So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up;* God will literally dry the Nile River up. 



#### Zechariah 10:11c *And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart.* Assyria will be humbled and brought down politically. Egypt's authority will be taken away. Genesis 12:3, 



#### z.   Zechariah 10:12 *"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD. Israel will once again walk by faith, strengthened in the Lord.*



##### The state of Israel when Messiah will come



### **Zechariah 11:1-3 The fleecing shepherd’s wail**

###### Zechariah 11:1-3 The Land is wailing - 



###### Zechariah 11:4-7 flock is doomed. 



###### Zechariah 11:8-11 God no longer favors the flock. 



###### Zechariah 11:12-13 Israel sells out Messiah 



###### Zechariah 11:14 Unity placed on hold 



###### Zechariah 11:15-16 Coming false shepherd 



###### Zechariah 11:17 God destroys Antichrist 



#### 

#### Due to the merchant leaders in Israel, God raises up yet another instrument to judge them. The next few verses describe the takeover of Jerusalem by Rome. This occurred in 63b.C.[[49\]](#_ftn51)

##### It is during the Roman empire that The Good Shepherd will come to offer to shepherd the sheep doomed to slaughter. 

###### The Good Shepherd will be met with opposition and ultimately be refused by the Jewish leaders. 

###### The temple was later burned to the ground in 70a.D. and Israel’s religious leaders had their temple hospice removed. 

##### The Romans ruled over Judah and declared the empire “Christian” under Constantine in the 4th century.

##### With no temple, no shepherds and no religion, Israel as a nation was “slaughtered”. They were no morIt was not until 1948 that Israel was reborn and that the Jews started to return to the land. 



####  Zechariah 11:1 *Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars.* Jeremiah 22:23



#### Zechariah 11:2a *Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed;* *Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down.* God will go after the strong point of the nation. Exodus 27:6

##### Lebanon was known for its cedar while Bashan for its oak forests. Isaiah 2:13, Ezekiel 27:6

##### The destruction of the trees in the land could be symbolic of the destruction of the people because of the bad leadership. Judges 9:7-16



####  Zechariah 11:3a *There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined;* The shepherds...wail...their glory (the temple) is ruined. Jeremiah 25:34-38

##### Lebanon furnished timber for building the temple. Ezra 3:7, 5:8, 6:4



##### Because the religious leaders abused the power given to them by using the temple and the people for profit, God will remote the temple and with it their glory. 

###### Jeremiah 25:34 *Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.*

###### Jeremiah 25:35 *And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.*

###### Jeremiah 25:36 *A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.*

###### Jeremiah 25:37 *And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.*

###### Jeremiah 25:38 *He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.*

##### Ultimately the temple was destroyed by the Roman Titus in 70a.D.



####  Zechariah 11:3b *There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.* The young lions can be heard roaring because the pride of the Jordan is in ruin. Jeremiah 50:44 

## Zechariah 11:4-14 Good Shepherd poem I 

### Zechariah 11:4-6 The avaricious shepherds 

#### The context of chapter 11 is obviously the rejection of a godly leader and his replacement by wicked leadership. Jesus saw Himself as both the wounded Shepherd (cf. Mark 8:32-33; 9:32-34; 10:35-37) and the Good Shepherd (cf. John 10).

#### This passage aligns well with Zechariah 13:7-9



#### Zechariah 11:4 *Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter.* Like before, Zechariah will take up mimes to explain what is going to occur. 



##### Zechariah is asked to act out the role of a Shepherd who actually pastures the flock. 



####  Zechariah 11:5a "*Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished,* the leaders were mercenaries, buying sheep to slay them and make a profit. 



##### The picture here is of Israel being delivered into the hand of their oppressors. 



####  Zechariah 11:5b *and each of those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!'* The religious people get rich from the oppression of the people. 



####  Zechariah 11:5c *And their own shepherds have no pity on them.* Unlike the good Shepherd who has compassion for the sheep, these hired hands don’t have any pity. 



####  Zechariah 11:6a *"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD;* Just like they had no pity, now God will show them no compassion. 



#### Zechariah 11:6b *"but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power."* This is referring to Israel under the oppression of Rome. 



##### The leaders will declare, “*we have no king but C*a*esar*”. John 19:12, 15



### **Zechariah 11:7-14: The Good Shepherd pastures the flock**

#### Zechariah 11:7a *So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.* God had said to pasture the flock…This role know to have been fulfilled Jesus but Zechariah was acting it out. Zechariah 11:4

##### This sort of acting out God’s word was a method applied by Isaiah, Jeremiah and especially Ezekiel. 



#### Zechariah 11:7b *And I took for myself two staffs:* Zechariah proceeds to get into his role of shepherd and takes up two staffs. 

##### Why two staffs? Eastern shepherds carried one rod to beat away beasts from the sheep and a crocked staff to retrieve sheep from a cliff or from tangled places. 

##### The purpose of the good shepherd was to pasture the flock. What does it mean to pasture a flock? Sheep need to be lead to pasture in order to eat. A shepherd knows where to lead the sheep to green pasture. Psalm 23

###### In same way, The Good Shepherd will come to feed or teach the people. 

###### Jesus came with the purpose of teaching the people. He used to rods to shepherd. 

###### Just like a shepherd has two staffs as means to pasture. The Good Shepherd calls one rod Favor and the other is called Union, signifying His purpose. He has come to grant favor and unity. 



#### Zechariah 11:7c *the one I called Favor…* *favor* NOAM means pleasantness, or graciousness.  One of the staffs is given the name “favor” to represent how God in grace had favored Israel. Deuteronomy 7:7



####  Zechariah 11:7d *and the other I called Union;* union CHEBEL means rope twisted together.  God's desire was to take the divided nation and unite them. Ezekiel 37:15-28



####  Zechariah 11:7e *so I pastured the flock.* Zechariah plays the role of a good Shepherd. Psalm 23

##### Every Shepherd is encouraged to take note. The Good Shepherd come to pasture (feed) the flock. 

###### The Good Shepherd uses favor, graciousness on the flock.

###### The Good Shepherd uses union; He binds the flock together. 

###### Psalm 23:4 Even *though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your **rod** and Your **staff**, they **comfort** me.*



####  Zechariah 11:8 *Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month...* the shepherd that came with favor and union in his hand suddenly takes a protective role and stands between the prey (religious leaders) and those being preyed on (the people). 

##### The word annihilated KACHAD means to destroy. Here in the sense of cutting down of power. 



##### This verse is possibly the verse that has the most interpretations of any other verse in the Old Testament. 

###### "One writer has counted forty different interpretations of these words".[[50\]](#_ftn52)



###### The context of this passage is during Christ's first coming. The three shepherds are removed within one month. Zechariah 10:3, Matthew 21:42-46



###### "...These three shepherds are the Pharisees and Herodians, the Sadducees." Matthew 22:15-16, Matthew 22:23, Matthew 22:34-35



###### These three groups were religious leaders at that time. 



###### (ii During His first coming, these three groups set aside their differences in order to get rid of Jesus Christ. 



###### (iv)    In order to get the death penalty, they became allies with Rome. 



##### When Rome destroyed the temple in the 5th month 70a.D. this was a death blow for these groups. 



###### According to the Mishnah, both temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av. This could hardly be seen as a coincidence.[[51\]](#_ftn53)

###### Today Israel mourns for the destruction, not of one but of two temples, on the same day! They cry for the Temple to be rebuilt yet fail to return to the Lord. 



####  Zechariah 11:8 *for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me*. The Lord’s impatience is a human term, so we understand, not because the Lord is impatient. The soul of the fleecing shepherds grew tired of the good shepherd. 



#### Zechariah 11:9 *Then I said, "I will not pasture you.* The problem was with the shepherds, not the people in this case. We are given a greater understanding of this in the Gospels. 

##### Because the religious leaders continued to reject the teachin and caused Israel to turn away, Jesus began teaching in parables about the coming Kingdom. Matthew 13:10-11, 13-15

##### Soon afterward, the focus began to change from being only to Israel to be primarily to the Gentiles. Acts 28:26‑28



#### Zechariah 11:9 *What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh.*" Previously we were told the three shepherds were going to be annihilated. God is going to let it play out and they will end up devouring each other. Matthew 15:14



#### Zechariah 11:10 *I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.* Zechariah grabs everyone’s attention when we breaks one of his staffs into pieces, symbolizing God breaking off a covenant with the nations. 

##### The imagery of the staff breaking makes us think the covenant is no more. However, the word break is PARAR also has the idea to frustrate or thwart. Perhaps this should be viewed as a postponement. 

###### Favor extended to the flock is frustrated. Since the flock rejected the Good shepherd, this was understandable. However due to the fact that favor was directed to the Gentiles through Israel they are affected by the rejection of Israel’s leaders. Therefore, the covenant to the peoples is delayed.

##### The staff symbolize instruments to pasture the flock. Therefore, what was broken is the faculty to pasture. That is, the ability to give favor in protecting the nation.  

###### It is difficult to be dogmatic about what covenant this could be referring to. 

#### This is not any covenants God made with Israel. Not merely a covenant to the people (Israel) but to all the peoples (nations). Isaiah 56:6-7

##### We aren't told this specifically but by implication, God has made a covenant with the peoples of the earth in relation to His own people Israel. 

###### One suggests, God has placed the nations under restraint lest they work Israel harm or ill."[[52\]](#_ftn54) Job 5:23, Ezekiel 34:25, Hosea 2:18, Genesis 12:3, Romans 15:8-9

###### A covenant made with the peoples cannot refer to the Mosaic since that covenant was made with Israel only. 



##### Regarding Israel...the promise has not been broken, only postponed. And postponement is not abandonment with God. That is what Zechariah 14 shows.[[53\]](#_ftn55)



#### Zechariah 11:11a *So it was broken on that day*, *and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me*...the afflicted of the flock refers to the small number of believing Israel. Luke 12:49-53



#### Zechariah 11:11c *realized that it was the word of the LORD.* *I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give me my wages;* Matthew 26:15, Mark 14:10-11



#### Zechariah 11:12b *but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.* The chief priests paid Judas Iscariot 30 pieces of silver to betray Jesus. Matthew 26:14-16



#### Zechariah 11:13a *Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter…*Zechariah is told to act this out in the temple and it symbolizes what actually will occur when the religious leaders will pay Judas to betray Jesus. 



#### Zechariah 11:13b *that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.*" This is sarcasm is a remark on the little value they placed on Him. Isaiah 53:3, Acts 4:11



#### Zechariah 11:13c *So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.* This was fulfilled when Judas returned the money to the chief priests and they in turn used it to buy a piece of land from the potter to use as a burial site for stranger. Matthew 27:3-7, Matthew 27:9-10



##### While the chief priests were willing to pay 30 pieces of silver for the Messiah, God sacrificed His only Son. The chief priests arranged their payment in secret while God paid in plain view for everyone to see. The chief priests maintained their political power (for a time) but God maintained perfect righteousness (forever). 



#### Zechariah 11:14 *Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union,* *to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.* Zechariah acts out the breaking of the second shepherd’s staff. With the rejection of the Shepherd comes the scattering of the sheep. A sheep without a shepherd will be prone to be scattered. 



##### In 70a.D. the temple was destroyed by the Romans and the people were scattered. 



##### If Messiah would have been placed as king he would have reunited the kingdom. The tribes of the north and the tribes of the south would have been one again. 1 Kings 12, Jeremiah 31:31 



##### Zechariah had said Messiah would come and unite the two kingdoms. Zechariah 10:6-8,



##### Ezekiel talks about two staffs coming together. This happens in the millennium. 



##### Judah and Israel will only be united when the Messiah is their Shepherd and brings them back together. 



##### Christ came in the name of the Father, He was not received. Another should come in his own name, and him the people would receive.[[54\]](#_ftn56)John 5:43



## Zechariah 11:15-17 The False Shepherd 

#### Zechariah 11:15 *"The LORD said to me, Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.* Zechariah is asked to continue the charades but this time he was to change his apparel to impersonate a foolish or worthless shepherd. 

##### *Foolish* EVILI means silly or foolish. Someone who does not take God into account is called a fool. “*The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God”*” Psalm 14:1 



##### Jesus said **He** was The Good Shepherd. He laid His life down for the sheep. John 10:10-11

###### Yet they valued Him like a worthless shepherd. 

##### This foolish shepherd lays down the life of the sheep for his own.



###### This illustrates what the lack of discernment the people have and will accept him as their shepherd. John 5:43



#### Zechariah 11:16a *"For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land...* This could mean the shepherd will be a Jew or one in Judah. He comes from the land, raised up by God. 



##### The difference between this false shepherd and the previous false shepherds is that this one was not chosen by the people. He is raised up by God to be an instrument of judgment upon them. 



#### Zechariah 11:16a *a shepherd...who will not care for the perishing,* This shepherd has other interests. He is not a good shepherd. 



##### Instead of feeding the flock he will not care and leave them starving. 



##### Daniel sheds light on this shepherd...he will be a wicked king...

###### Daniel 11:36 "Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished... 



##### Paul describes him this way...



###### 2 Thessalonians 2:4 who opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, displaying himself as being God.

##### The temple of God refers to the Tribulation temple. Antichrist places his throne in the temple, as though he were God. 

###### The Tribulation temple is thought to be the same temple as the one in Ezekiel 40-48. This cannot be since the Branch will build it when He comes and the people will come from all over to build it. 

###### The temple is a holy temple, built to God. If that were not the case then Antichrist couldn’t desecrate it. The abomination of desolation is contingent upon the fact that the temple is holy to some extent at least. 



##### This refers to the abomination of desolation Daniel spoke of at the midpoint of the tribulation period. 

###### Daniel 11:37 *"He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will magnify himself above them all.*



###### Revelation 13:4 *they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?"*



##### Because the Antichrist gets his ruling power directly from Satan (the dragon), when people worship him, they are really worshipping Satan. 

###### Revelation 13:6 *And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven.*



###### Revelation 13:7 *It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him.*



###### Revelation 13:8a *All who dwell on the earth will worship him...*



##### Though God will permit Antichrist to rise to power, his reign will be temporary and brought to an end at the end of the 7-year Tribulation period. 

###### Revelation 13:5 *...and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him.* 



####  Zechariah 11:16b *a shepherd...who will not...seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing,* *but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.* This evil shepherd is worse than the fleecing shepherds. He will devour them. John 10:10



##### Evidently the nation of Israel must have had a time of peace and safety since it refers to them as fat. Antichrist comes into power offering peace. 

##### Israel experiences up to about three and a half years of peace before Antichrist breaks the treaty after 42 months. 

###### Tearing off the hoofs of the sheep probably represents the shepherd as extremely greedy, searching for the last edible morsel that he can extract from his charges whom he has consumed.[[55\]](#_ftn57)



####  Zechariah 11:17a "*Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock!* Woe, take pity, because God will destroy this false shepherd. John 10:12



####  Zechariah 11:17b *A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.*" The arm represents power, the eye intelligence. These will be destroyed. God will remove his power and his intelligence. Revelation 13:3 



##### his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye utterly darkened. - JNDarby translation



##### A sword will hurt the Good Shepherd. Zechariah 13:7



##### Summary of Antichrist

###### He does not care for the people of Israel. 

###### He will be a man who comes up from the land of Israel, 

###### not interested in women 

###### later given great satanic authority to continue reigning as king. It seems at one point he receives a fatal blow and is miraculously restored to life. At least enough time for him to come back and reign another 42 months (3 1/2 years). 



###### He will use the Jewish people to achieve his goals. 

###### Ultimately, he will persecute the Tribulation saints (those who believed during the Tribulation period). 



## Zechariah 12:1-14:21 The Burden regarding Israel

### The following three chapters (12-14) could easily be the most important eschatological chapters for Israel. These chapters clearly reveal future events in the life of Israel that God uses to bring about a turn around after being rejected for a undescribed period of time. 

### Zechariah 12:1- A Day of Mourning



#### Key theme in burden 2: Day of the Lord regarding Israel. This term appears 18 times in this burden. 



#### It provides us with more details. The Battle of Armageddon (Revelation), thes destruction of those nations. Correlates with 1st and 8th visions. 



#### Repentance of Israel is necessary for Messiah's return. 



####  The same Shepherd that was rejected in the first burden will come and rescue them in this burden. The King on the donkey will return riding on a horse. 



####  The false prophets - relates to 7th vision. 



####  Shows us what life will be during Millennium 



####  Now, Zechariah, in pertaining things of the future, he will go back to God as creator and owner, setting a creator-creature distinction. 



### **Zechariah 12:1-3 A time of world focus on Jerusalem**

#### Zechariah 12:1 A *threefold declaration of God as creator and owner.* 



##### Zechariah 12:1a *The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.* While the first burden was regarding the nations, this second burden is specific to Israel. Israel here does not mean the northern tribes alone but all of the Jewish nation.



##### Zechariah 12:1b *Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens,* God has authority over the heavenly realm. Genesis 1:1, Isaiah 42:5

###### When Moses is about to begin instructing Israel regarding their identity as a people, he begins by teaching God as creator and owner and therefore supreme authority.

###### The verbs in verse 1 imply a continuous action. God continues to stretch, lay and form. 



##### Zechariah 12:1c *lays the foundation of the earth,* He also has authority over the earthly realm Genesis 1:1, Job 38:3-6



##### Zechariah 12:1d *and forms the spirit of man within him,* God is over the human real. 



###### Humans have a material part (physical body) and an immaterial part (the soul). God has formed man's spirit within him. Genesis 2:7

###### The "spirit" of man means the unique person with the potential of rebellion or fellowship. Psalm 139[[56\]](#_ftn58)



###### These three expressions show God as the creator is no doubt owner and fully empowered over creation to do as He wishes. God has all the necessary credentials. 



###### This is like when Jesus, when about to interact with the 7 churches in Revelation. Each time he introduces himself according to what He will say. Revelation 2-3. 



#### Zechariah 12:2a *"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around;* God will raise up Jerusalem to cause stumbling to the nations.



##### Reeling (RAAL) - staggering - something that causes one to stumble like in a drunken stupor. The nations won't be able to control themselves. They will gravitate to Jerusalem. The center of the tension will be Jerusalem. 



##### Jerusalem will become an obsession to the nations. It will make them stumble around like drunken people. 



##### This may be fulfilled when the peace treaty is signed. 



#### Zechariah 12:2b *and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.* The central focus of the nations appears to be Jerusalem which is at the center of Judah, therefore it will also be attacked. 



####  Zechariah 12:3a *"It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples.* 

##### *In that day*...this is when the nations of the world come up against Jerusalem, Jerusalem will become a heavy stone as well as cup that causes reeling. Zechariah 12:2, Psalm 75:8, Jeremiah 25:15-16



####  Zechariah 12:3b *all who lift it will be severely injured.* Jerusalem is like an immovable stone that the more the nations try to move it, will be cut. Genesis 12:3



##### Joel 3:2 *I will also gather all the nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of my people and mine inheritance, Israel, **whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land.***



##### Since the nations of the earth cut the land of Israel, God will divide them. 



##### God is creator and owner of the earth. Also, of man's spirit within him. Is God limited to moving someone's spirit in one direction or another? God says if you try to move or affect Jerusalem in any way, I will do it to you! This is true throughout history not just during this time. To all the peoples of all time. 



###### This time refers to the whole period of the Tribulation. 

###### Those who try to mess with the apple of God's eye will have to deal with God. 



####  Zechariah 12:3b *And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.* Not some, but all are gathered in array against Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:2, 

##### This is the insanity of the nations against Israel. 



###### This hasn't happened yet, but Zechariah says it will happen one day. When? We can't be dogmatic but there are certain clues in Scripture. 

###### Possible scenario:



###### Israel is regathered in the land. Ezekiel 37:12, Isaiah 11:11-42



###### Ancient cities rebuilt and inhabited. Ezekiel 36:1-5, 8-10



###### (ii Muslim Arab resistance - Jeremiah 49, Isaiah 17, Zephaniah 4:2, Jeremiah 49



###### (iv)    Must be a level of security and prosperity. Ezekiel 38:10-12 



###### (v)    Gog and Magog - perhaps this will be the catalyst to sign the peace treaty. Daniel 9



###### (v Midpoint of The Tribulation. Matthew 24:15-21



###### (vi1260-day period - second half of Daniel 70th week. 1/3 of nation will be protected while they are hunted down by Antichrist. 



###### (viii)  Nations gather at the valley of Jehoshaphat (Armageddon) to form one army. Revelation 16:16, 19:18-21

###### (ix)    The army of the nations moves south to attack Jerusalem.



##### All of history is building up to this climactic moment of confrontation with evil.  Psalm 2; Isaiah 8:9-10, 17:12-14; Ezekiel 38-39; Daniel 9:24-27, 11:36-45; Joel 3:9-17; Zechariah 14:2; Revelation 16:14-16, 19:17-19

##### This burden probably begins near the midpoint of The Tribulation

###### Joel 3:9 *Proclaim this among the nations: prepare war, arouse the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.*



###### Joel 3:10 *Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.*



###### Joel 3:11 *Haste ye and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.*



###### Joel 3:12 *Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.*



###### Joel 3:13 *Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down, for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.*



###### Joel 3:14 *Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of decision.*



###### Joel 3:15 *The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.*



###### Joel 3:16 *And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: and Jehovah will be a shelter for his people, and the refuge of the children of Israel.*

### Zechariah 12:4-9 The Lord of Hosts defends Jerusalem. Psalm 21:4



#### Zechariah 12:4a *"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment*.



#### Zechariah 12:4b *and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah,* 

##### *I will watch over*…is a term in Hebrew for care and attentiveness. 1 Kings 8:29, 2 Chronicles 7:15, Nehemiah 1:6

##### There is some question as to Judah’s involvement. It is uncertain whether they are for or against the people of Jerusalem. 



#### Zechariah 12:4c *while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.* The nations come against Israel on horses. Ezekiel 38-39, 

##### *blindness* - removed from Jewish people, Zechariah 12:10



##### blindness and madness is an interesting combo. It relates back to Deuteronomy 28:28. 



##### It is a dangerous thing to go against Israel. Israel's true iron dome is God. Psalm 21:4 



####  Zechariah 12:5a *"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts…* In order for Judah to recognize their help comes from the Lord, they have to have their blindness removed. Judah recognizes in their hearts that their defender, the one who fights for them is the Lord of Hosts. Proverbs 4:23, Nehemiah 4:20



####  Zechariah 12:5b *'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.'*  Judah is coming to the realization perhaps they are on the wrong side of history. 

##### This seems to be saying that Judah will recognize the importance of the God (*their God*) of the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

##### Judah was participating in the takeover of Jerusalem, but changed their minds when they saw the faith of Jerusalem's defenders.

##### Just like Israel, we too have blindness that needs to be removed. We too have things that we regard as strengths and one by one God has to show us that those are hinderances rather than strengths. 



####  Zechariah 12:6a *"In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves,* Once God is on their side (they trust God) they will become mighty and untouchable. 



####  Zechariah 12:6b *so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples,* Judah goes from being an enemy to being a mighty force in God’s hands. 



#### Zechariah 12:6c *while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.* The city of Jerusalem will be back in her place. The land is theirs by right. The creator of the earth has deeded them the land. 

##### They are dwelling on their own sites. Ezekiel 34:13, 36:24, 37:14, 21; Leviticus 25:23



#### Zechariah 12:7a *"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,* save here refers to physical protection. Hebrews 11:7, Philippians 1:13



##### tents could be understood as military camps or as homes - defenseless people of Judah.



#### Zechariah 12:7b *so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.* people living in the city have fortification (gated community). Both those in the tents (homeless) and those in the city will be saved in the exact same way. 

##### Success will not be attributed to human ability. 



##### The Lord will defend the tents before the protected capital so that both recognize it is the Lord. Both will realize the victory is of the Lord. 



##### In order for the instrument not to take credit from God, he often chooses the least qualified people to use. 



##### Gideon - least of his clan



##### Moses - isn't qualified. Not a speaker. 



##### Jeremiah - Who am I? I am but a youth



##### If God can work through a flawed instrument, people won't say it was them, people are obligated to say God did it. if we believe that we are inadequate for God, take heart, we are precisely the kind of person God has used throughout history! 1 Corinthians 1:26-31, 2 Corinthians 10:17



##### God will work so that human pride will not be indulged. [[57\]](#_ftn59)



#### Zechariah 12:8 *"In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem,*



#### Zechariah 12:8 *and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David,* God is their strength. They are supernaturally powerful. The oldest and weakest will be like David! 

##### It was known and even songs were written about David’s God given prowess in battle. 1 Samuel 18:7



#### Zechariah 12:9a *and the house of David will be like God,* just like David’s victories were God supernaturally fighting for them, so it will be on that day. 



##### Man’s thinking he can become like God started in the very beginning. That is not what this is saying. Genesis 3:5, Isaiah 14:14

##### It was common during the Greeks and Romans to think wars were won if the gods accompanied you. 



##### This should be understood as they will seem like God ELOHIM in the eyes of their enemies. Even as Moses did before Pharoah. Exodus 7:1



#### Zechariah 12:9b *like the angel of the LORD before them.* 



##### The Angel of the Lord is limitless in His power. Isaiah 37:6 



##### The reason they will look like the Angel of the Lord before them, is because it really is the Angel of the Lord fighting for them. 



#### Zechariah 12:9c *"And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.* In this case it will not be luck or the numbers or ability of a certain leaders but of the God of Israel who destroys all the enemy nations. 

## Zechariah 12:10 - A Day of Mourning

### Zech title?

#### Zechariah 12:10a *"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication,* only when Israel comes back will God pour out His Spirit. Ezekiel 36:24-25, Joel 2:28

##### *I will pour out*… is often used to express God pouring out His Spirit. Ezekiel 39:29; Joel 2:28,29; Isaiah 44:3

##### Spirit is RUAH. There is no article in the Hebrew. This is not a reference to the Holy Spirit but to the human spirit. 

##### Positive attributes of the human spirit

###### Deuteronomy 34:9 "*filled with the spirit of wisdom*" 

###### Isaiah 28:6 "*a spirit of justice*"

##### Negative attributes of the human spirit

###### Numbers 5:14,30 "*a spirit of jealousy*" 

###### Isaiah 19:4 "*a spirit of distortion*" 

###### Isaiah 29:10 "a spirit of deep sleep" 

###### Hosea 4:12 "a spirit of harlotry"

#### God is pouring out a grace spirit in verse 10 as a result of their conversion and removing an impurity spirit (RUAH) in verse 12. The land is mourning in verse 10 but is cleansed in verse 12. This is the working of the Holy Spirit. 

##### The completion of the second temple was a small foreshadowing of this major event. Zechariah 4:5



##### The prophets spoke of the day when God's Spirit would be poured out. It would be the dawning of a new age when all the promises made would be fulfilled. Isaiah 32:15, Joel 2:28-32, Ezekiel 39:29, Isaiah 44:3



#### Zechariah 12:10b …*so that they will look on Me…* the word *translated "on"* in this verse should really be translated as "to" or "unto". That is, the people looked to Him for deliverance. They looked unto Him for the deliverance of their sin. Isaiah 45:22, Numbers 21:9, John 3:14-15

####  Zechariah 12:10c …*whom they have pierced;* The description can fit none other than Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified in the year 33a.D. Numbers 25:8, Judges 9:54, I Samuel 31:4, I Chronicles 10:4, Psalm 22:16-17, Zechariah 2:11

##### John confirms the fulfillment of this prophecy as he stood from afar and watched Jesus being crucified and pierced through with a spear. John 19:34-37

##### Typically, Jews killed people by stoning. John 8:58-59

##### However, Zechariah foretells the Jews pierced Him. Psalm 22 predicts the crucifixion 1000 years in advance. Isaiah 53:5 is a prophecy 700 years in advance of the cross. But Zechariah’s prophecy is 3000 years ahead of its fulfillment. 

##### This is the moment when all of heaven (and a few from earth) have been waiting for in this nail-biting series.

###### The order of events is important. Zechariah makes this clear. The faithfulness of God is seen growing exponentially while at the same time Israel’s sinfulness. 

###### To Zechariah’s generation God had said, “*Return to me, I will return to you*” To the next generations he continues, “*return to me, I will return to you*”. 

###### Jesus, God in the flesh, came proclaiming in person, “*return to Me, I will return to you*”. 

###### (ii The people rejected Jesus. They killed the Lord of glory! 1 Corinthians 2:8 

###### (iv)    Today, through the Church, even through jealousy, God is calling out to Israel, “*return to Me, I will return to you*” Romans 11:1, 11-14

###### (v)    In the midst of war, in their greatest of woes ever, their blinders are removed, and they realize who Messiah really was and that He had come to save them thousands of years earlier! He had been the lamb of God who came to remove the sins of the whole world. In a moment, all of Israel changes their minds and turns to the Lord. All of Israel puts their faith in Him. 

###### (v Almost as a child calls for his daddy, Israel as one, calls out to the Lord for deliverance from their enemies, “Abba Help!”

###### In a moment, in a flash, they will all see the same Jesus, the same man that was pierced, coming in the clouds. Every eye in Jerusalem will see Him. Jesus the Messiah will come back, yes…the very one they had pierced. Just like God had been announcing all along, if you’ll return to me…I WILL COME BACK (RETURN) TO YOU! 

###### Revelation 1:7 *BEHOLD, HE IS COMING WITH THE CLOUDS, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen.*

###### Christian, there is nothing you can do that can separate you from the love of God in Christ! 

###### Are you a Christian? Why? Are you a Christian because you have prayed asking God to forgive you? God had already paid for your sins at the cross. Did you ask Him to somehow do it again? This does not make you a Christian. 

###### Are you a Christian because of asking Jesus to be your Lord? Jesus is the Lord of the living and the dead. He doesn’t need you to make Him anything. He is God. This does not make you a Christian. 

###### Have you realized the penalty of your sin is death eternal and there is absolutely no possibly way to make that right by changing your ways or doing good. This is why Messiah came to die because it was the only way. 

###### The only requirement to receive the free gift of salvation is faith. John 3:16, Acts 16:30-31, Ephesians 2:8-9



###### We are justified **freely** by his grace. Romans 5:1



###### (ii Upwards of 150 passages in the Bible condition receiving salvation to believing only. [[58\]](#_ftn60)



###### Friend, have you placed your faith in the person of Christ and His finished work alone for your salvation? There is nothing you have done that His death on calvary does not cover. Are you confident this same Jesus died and rose again for you too? Trust in Christ alone to be saved. This is what makes you a Christian! 

####  Zechariah 12:10c *and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son,* The loss of a son, an only son is among the greatest sorrows known to man. 

##### When Israel comes to life, they will begin to sob with great sadness. The moment of realization comes after they are delivered spiritually. They all will receive the Holy Spirit and God will give them a spirit of grace. Hearts that feel with deep intensity the error of what they did when they crucified the Lord of glory. Matthew 5:4



##### Some say that in order to be saved one must mourn, feel profound shame and guilt for sin. If this is true, then Judas would have been saved. Hell will be filled with people who felt a deep sadness but never trusted in Christ. 



##### The nation here is exerting sadness because they are saved. They are deeply moved by God’s gracious gift. He gave his only son to they might return to Him and He to them! 



##### It is the Spirit that teaches us the deep appreciations of the Person of Christ and His work which in turn gives us a spirit of grace. Titus 2:11-13



###### They will see Jesus of Nazareth in a new way! Upon realizing who He is and what He did they will be impacted by their response of rejection. Their self-righteousness had taken them to crucify God's Shepherd who in turn gave His life for the sheep. 



###### The Holy Spirit includes several instances in Scripture of grieving parents over their only son.  Luke 7:12-15, Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10



###### Joseph story: brothers betrayed him, then his brothers reunited. They rejected him then received him. Gen 50:20, Gen 45:14, The brothers are a type of Israel's story when they are reunited with their Messiah. 

### Zechariah 12:10-13:1 The Deliverance of Judah



#### Zechariah 12:10 *and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.* In a Jewish home, the firstborn was an especially important person. [***[59\]***](#_ftn61)

##### Just like God gave His only Son, they will feel in a human sense the profound sense of weight the free gift of salvation cost God to procure it for man and the immense error of their way for having rejected him for 3 millennia. 

###### Matthew 5:4 "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.



#### Zechariah 12:11a *"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem,*



#### Zechariah 12:11b *like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.* 2 Chronicles 35:25-27

##### Josiah, one of the last godly kings, when he died there was great weeping. In Josiah's death, the last hope for Judah faded and the people wept uncontrollably. 

###### Some say this refers to weeping over the Canaanite god Ba’al, however the context does not seem to indicate that. 2 Kings 5:18

##### The plain of Megiddo is the valley of Armageddon. Revelation 16:16 

##### As this conflict is taking place, the whole nation starts to weep uncontrollably. 



####  Zechariah 12:12a *"The land will mourn, every family by itself;* 

##### This describes a individual revival taking place in a national sense. Matthew 24:30



##### Matthew 24:30 "And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall **all the tribes of the land lament**, and they shall see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. Darby



####  Zechariah 12:12b *the family of the house of David...* David represents the regal authority over the nation. 2 Samuel 7:16



####  Zechariah 12:12c *the family of the house of Nathan...* represents the prophets. 2 Samuel 7:17, 12:7



####  Zechariah 12:13a *the family of the house of Levi...*the priests too will mourn. 



#### Zechariah 12:13b *the family of the house of Shimeites by itself…* non-priestly Levites who weren't necessarily priests will mourn by themselves. 



#### Zechariah 12:13c *and their wives by themselves;* the wives of the royal family, the prophets, priests and all the Levites will weep, 



#### Zechariah 12:14 *all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.* this is individual mourning on a national scale because God has saved them from their sins. Romans 11:25-26, Jeremiah 5:31, Jeremiah 30:7 

### Zechariah 13:1-5 Spiritual cleansing of the land



#### Zechariah 13:1 *"In that day a fountain will be opened…* The day of Israel’s salvation will be like a fountain flowing with forgiveness. Isaiah 12:2-3, Jeremiah 2:13, Romans 11:26-27, Ephesians 5:26, Titus 3:5

##### There will be an interval period of 75 days. Daniel 12:11 1290 days - Midpoint to end of tribulation is 1260 but 1335 (+45) 



##### 12 and 13 are so close, some suggest a chapter division was uncalled for. Israel converts in chapter 12 but is cleansed in chapter 13. 

#### God's life-giving water will now flow forever. [[60\]](#_ftn62)Zechariah 14:8, Ezekiel 47:1-12, Revelation 22:1; Ps. 46:4).



#### Zechariah 13:1 *for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.* this fountain pictures the cleansing that takes place in Israel. Ezekiel 36:24-28, John 3:3, 5

##### It involves cleansing of the land of wickedness. This connects well with the flying Scroll of vision 6. 



####  Zechariah 13:2a *"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land,* Idolatry will be removed from the land. 



##### Commandments #1 and #2 deal with idolatry. Ignoring these first two commandments is what got Israel sent into exile. 



####  Zechariah 13:2b *and they will no longer be remembered...* 

### Zechariah 13:2c-5 False Prophets removed



#### Zechariah 13:2c *and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.* 

##### Here unclean spirit has the article. It refers to one spirit in particular. Satan was blinding people to the Gospel and to believe the deception of the false prophets. This will be removed. 2 Corinthians 4:1-6

##### Revelation 20:1 - Satan will be bound for 1000 years. So he would not deceive the nations. Idolatry will not be started again because they will be bound up. 

##### False prophets can do miracles. They say, “let's follow other gods”. They contradict what God has said. Their predictions are inaccurate. Deuteronomy 18:20-22

##### Demonic influence is removed...there’s no temptation to idolatry. Those born in Millennium will have freedom to choose for or against God. None of Israel will reject God, however. It will come from the nations. 



#### Zechariah 13:3 *"And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD';* This is a return to the law. Deuteronomy 13:1-5

##### Parents who have children who have false prophets will execute them. This will be a fear of the Lord, not a fear of the religious leaders. John 9:21-23



#### Zechariah 13:3 *and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.* Deuteronomy 13:6-10



####  Zechariah 13:4 *"Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies,* Jeremiah 23, Ezekiel 13

##### All teaching must be tested. How do we test it? By placing it in light of Scripture. 1 John 4:1



####  Zechariah 13:4-5 *and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive;* The dangerous situation for false prophets will cause them to go into hiding. 

##### Samuel, Elisha, Elijah, and John wore heavy robes. 1 Samuel 28:14, 1 Kings 19:13, 2 Kings 1:8, Matthew 3:4

##### False prophets, in order to deceive look the same. They are really wolves but have the outward appearance of sheep (look authentic). Matthew 7:15



####  Zechariah 13:5 *but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.'* They will pretend they aren't prophets at all. They will lie about their vocation.  He will say he is a farmer rather than a prophet.



####  Zechariah 13:6a *"And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?'* People will ask him about the wounds between his arms. 

#### Him in the context is a false prophet trying to avoid being caught. 

##### Traditionally this verse has been interpreted to say that this is talking about Jesus. To see Jesus in this passage is simply a poor hermeneutic as the context will not allow it. 



##### False prophets and would cut themselves to enhance their ecstasy, to increase ritual potency, or to identify themselves with a particular god. 1 Kings 18:28; Jeremiah 41:5; 48:37

###### The false prophet will be easily recognized by special cultic marks on his body. "*Between his arms*" is a Hebrew idiom for somewhere on his back, chest, arms, or hands. There seem to be two OT allusions to this practice: [[61\]](#_ftn63)

###### the prophets of Ba'al. 1 Kings 18:28) [[62\]](#_ftn64)

###### special pagan practices for mourning. Leviticus 19:28,  21:5; Deuteronomy 14:1; Jeremiah 16:6, 41:5, 48:37[[63\]](#_ftn65)



#### Zechariah 13:6b *Then he will say, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.'* False prophets, in order not to get caught, will say it was an accident to avoid further questioning. 

##### *Friends* or lovers is a term often used in the Old Testament for people who practice idolatry. Jeremiah 22:20,22; 30:14; Ezekiel 16:33,36,37; 23:5,9,22; Hosea 2:7,9,12,14,15

## H.  Zechariah 13:7-9 – The Good Shepherd poem II  



#### Zechariah 13:7a *"Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd,* God commands the death penalty upon Messiah. Isaiah 53:10

##### With the genre change between the prose in verses 1-6 and poetry in 7-9 comes a huge break in subject change. It goes from talking descriptively about false prophets to a poem about the Good Shepherd. 

##### Contrary to popular opinion, when God gave His son, Messiah, it was to be the sin bearer for all of humanity not to come and not merely to show us a better way to live. Isaiah 53:12, John 3:16, Romans 5:8

###### God allowed the Jews to have their way and to convince Rome to hold a public crucifixion of an innocent man. The penalty for the sins of mankind was not a secret arrangement between an illuminated few but rather presented to the whole world because that’s who He died for. 



#### Zechariah 13:7b *And against the man, My Associate,"*literally, “the man of my union.” 



#### Zechariah 13:7c *Declares the LORD of hosts.* The identity of the Messiah, He will man and divine

##### The Lord of Hosts’ Associate is only used here and in Leviticus. Leviticus 5:21, 18:20, 19:15,17, 24:19, 25:14,15

###### The Shepherd is struck with the sword. Jesus quotes this verse to His Disciples referring to himself as the shepherd and they as the sheep. Matthew 26:30-31

###### When Israel rejected the Son, it was because they had rejected the Father. 



####  Zechariah 13:7 *"Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones.* We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep. 



##### *The little ones* - the disciples were scattered, Israel was scattered because they crucified the Shepherd. Deuteronomy 4:27

##### Mark 14:27-28 *And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, because it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.' "But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."* 



###### Jesus quotes Zechariah then continues saying that He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah’s message with the Gospel accounts. 



###### Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound. Notice how it is God who plays the leading role in Messiah's work. He causes him to be stricken. It is also God raises Messiah back to life three days later. Acts 2:32



###### Isaiah 53:4 Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, **Smitten of God**, and afflicted.

###### Jesus was *smitten of God*. The next verse goes on to explain why...



###### Isaiah 53:5 *But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His **scourging** we are healed.* 



###### The word *scourging* (CHABBURAH singular) is another word for blow or wound. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins. 



###### Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do these 500 years in advance. He would *strike down the Shepherd*, *turn His hand against the little ones* and *raise the Shepherd back up*. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 

###### The Gospel was God's eternal plan for the redemption of man. 



##### Jesus' death on the cross is the maximum expression of love and justice merging together at one place. The perfect justice requiring a perfect sacrifice was realized when God's Son Himself paid with His life. At that same moment, God demonstrated His love for mankind. Romans 5:8



### Zechariah 13:8-9 Israel is Fully Restored

#### Zechariah 13:8 *"It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off and perish;* 



##### Two thirds of the Jewish people will die in the land. Ezekiel 28:38



##### Hitler is known for having killed 6 million Jews. That is an estimated one third of Israel. What will happen at this time (Tribulation) in history has nothing comparable to it neither will there every be anything like it. 



##### Matthew 24:15 - abomination of desolation. Let the reader understand - flee to the mountains. 



#### Zechariah 13:8-9 *But the third will be left in it. "And I will bring the third part through the fire,* The immediate context refers to the land, two thirds of the people perishing and one third surviving, we can assume then the fire must also be literal. 



##### The refiners fire is the way metals are purified. 1 Peter 1:6-7



##### This fire will serve God's purposes to test the Jews and to look heavenward and call on the name of the Lord. 



##### The remnant that survives would include the 144,000 sealed Jews mentioned in Revelation 7:1-8 and 14:1-5

##### God has to move heaven and earth to bring about Israel's restoration. 



#### Zechariah 13:9a *Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested.* 



##### In the days of Zechariah, a refiner would take the raw gold or silver and place it in a ceramic container. Inside the container was the ore—not just the precious metal, but also impurities such as zinc, lead, and salt.[[64\]](#_ftn66)



##### The ceramic container was put into a fiery kiln for five days. During those five days, all of the impurities would separate to the outside edges of the container. Nothing would be left in the middle of the vessel but the pure silver or gold. [[65\]](#_ftn67)

##### This sort of metallurgic term to symbolize a spiritual refining is used in other passages. Proverbs 17:3; Isaiah 1:25, 48:10



####  Zechariah 13:9b ***They\*** *will call on My name…* they will call because they had believed earlier. Romans 10:9-10. Calling on His name brought physical deliverance. They were already saved before this. 

##### This verse contains covenant phrases. Hosea 2:19-23

##### It has a chiastic structure using they, I, I, they. 



##### When will the Jewish nation call on the Lord? At the end of the Tribulation. Matthew 23:37-39, Psalm 118:26, Joel 2:32, Romans 10:13, 



####  Zechariah 13:9c *And **I** will answer them.* 

##### Romans 11:26 - the remaining 1/3 will be saved. 



##### God will one day answer them because he is promising right here that this is what He will do. 



####  Zechariah 13:9d *will say, 'They are My people,'* God has returned to them because they had returned to Him in faith.



####  Zechariah 13:9e *And **they** will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"*…The Lord is my God will be proclaimed. Psalm 43:4, Romans 1:8



##### Upon their successful response to the testing, once again Israel will be seen to be God's people among the nations. They will be the light to the Gentiles. Isaiah 42:6, Acts 13:47

## Zechariah 14:1-7 - Jerusalem's Deliverance

### Israel is the naval of the earth. Ezekiel 5:5 

#### The naval is set in the center of the human body, so the land is the naval of the world, situated in the center of the world in Jerusalem. Jerusalem in the center of the land of Israel. And the sanctuary in the center of Jerusalem. The holy place in the center of the sanctuary, and the ark of the covenant in the center of the holy place, and the foundation stone before the holy place because from it the world was founded. [[66\]](#_ftn68)

#### A thirteenth-century crusader [map](https://cloud.cc3d.org/index.php/s/oKJPrS29NwFbpkw/preview) places Jerusalem at the center of the earth...the map depicts the earth as a three-leaf clover, each leaf being a continent: Europe, Asia, and Africa. The three are drawn together by a ring encircling a single city; that city is Jerusalem.[[67\]](#_ftn69)

#### Verse 12 tells of Jehovah smiting his enemies and their “flesh” being consumed. Again, this cannot refer to a period after the literal return of Christ; the Coming of the Lord will signal “the end,” at which point the dead will be raised, and the living - in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye - will be changed from flesh to a new, spiritual essence. We will pass from corruption to incorruption, from mortality to immortality (1 Cor. 15:23-24,51-53).

### Three main views exist regarding the Millennium and the interpretation of Zechariah chapter 14. 

##### Some hold it to be a symbolic prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, together with a spread of the gospel throughout the Christian age thereafter.[[68\]](#_ftn70)

##### Some say it is a depiction of the history of spiritual “Jerusalem” (the church), from the time of its commencement on the day of Pentecost throughout the Christian age.

##### Chapter 14 are Zechariah's prophecy regarding a future fulfillment when Messiah returns to the earth to establish a literal earthly kingdom in Jerusalem. 

#### Zechariah 14:1 *Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.* The nations who took from Jerusalem will be returned. 

##### *You*…is singular referring only to Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:2

##### Then the Lord will return their spoil. Zechariah 14:14

##### Just like God took away, He now turns to bless them. 

###### The interpretive key here is *a day is coming*. This clearly refers to the Day of the Lord which is a period of time. 

###### They day of the Lord stands in contrast to man's day. Currently man is having his day but a time will come when God will openly intervene with the affairs of man, first for judgment, then for blessing. 

###### The day of the Lord in its broadest sense refers to the period of time beginning with the rapture and continuing until the creation of the new heavens and new earth. 

###### However, the Day of the Lord does not always refer to the whole period of time. Context helps determine what portion of the day is being referred to. It could mean any one of the following: 

###### The Tribulation period

###### The Second Coming

###### The Millennium

###### The entire period between the Rapture until the new heavens and the new earth. 

###### There are different terms used to describe the nature of the Day of the Lord. 

###### Wrath. Zephaniah 1:15, Zechariah 14:1-9

###### Judgment. Revelation 14:7

###### Indignation. Isaiah 26:20-21

###### Trial. Revelation 3:10 

###### Trouble. Jeremiah 30:7

###### Destruction. Joel 1:15

###### Darkness. Amos 5:18

###### Desolation. Daniel 9:27

###### Overturning. Isaiah 24:1-4, 19-21

###### Punishment. Isaiah 24:20-21

###### Glory. Isaiah 11:10

###### Praise. Isaiah 12:1, 4

###### Salvation. Isaiah 25:9 

###### Worship: Isaiah 27:13

### **Zechariah 14:2-3 The Great Tribulation** 

#### Zechariah 14:2a *For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured,* The war of all world wars. The city of Jerusalem vs the nations of the earth. 

##### verses 2 and 3 cover most of the Great Tribulation period, the second half of Daniel’s 70th week.

##### God makes the nations join against Jerusalem. Ezekiel 38-39, Zechariah 12:3, Ezekiel 5:5, Ezekiel 38:12

#### Zechariah 14:2b *the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled,* The people inside Jerusalem will take a beating. For a time, the city will be captured. 2/3 of the nation will be destroyed. 

>If Israel is Gods chosen why were 2/3 killed? Shouldn't all be saved? Election has to do with Gods choice for purpose, not destiny. God chose Israel to be a light, to be the ethnicity of the Savior, to be the keeper of the Old Testament Scriptures, and so much more. An Israelite must believe to be delivered from hell. God didn’t choose the whole only 1/3. This is saying God made them believe. He does not do that however he did know they would since he knows all things.

#### Zechariah 14:2c *but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.* The people outside of the city will not have access to help. 

##### When the Romans came against Jerusalem in A.D. 70 they came with a multinational army and brought terrible destruction on the city and its people. Yet there was none of the deliverance that Zechariah will describe in the following verses, so it is difficult to say that this was fulfilled in the Roman attack upon Jerusalem in A.D. 70.[[69\]](#_ftn71)

### **Zechariah 14:3-7 The Return of the King!** 

#### Zechariah 14:3 *Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.* Just about when things seem lost, when no one else will help Israel, the Lord will come and turn it all around. Psalm 121:4, Exodus 4:2, 

##### Messiah will come and supernaturally overcome the nations going against Jerusalem. He no longer comes in reference to sin but as a conquering warrior. He returns as the Lion of Judah. 

###### Revelation 19:11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness **He judges and wages war**.

###### Revelation 19:12 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.

###### Revelation 19:13 He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.

###### Revelation 19:14 And **the armies which are in heaven**, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were **following Him on white horses**. This is the Lord of Hosts coming. 

###### Revelation 19:15 From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that **with it He may strike down the nations**, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty. 

###### Revelation 19:16 And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."

##### 7 Literal Events Foretold when Jesus Descends in Zechariah 14:4-9

###### Messiah’s feet will stand on the mount of Olives

###### The mount of Olives will be split

###### The saints will return with Him

###### The remnant will flee

###### The luminaries will dwindle

###### Living waters will flow

###### The Lord will be King over the whole earth

#### Zechariah 14:4a *In that day **His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives**, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east;* 2 Samuel 15:30, Acts 1:9-12, Matthew 24:3, 

##### the Mount of Olives rises to a height of 2,710 feet, making it higher than the Temple Mount.

##### The last time God descended on a mountain in this way was in the giving of the law. Exodus 19:18

##### Jerusalem, and to the east, the mount of olives are physical places. Jesus Christ is physically coming back to earth. Job 19:25

##### This is not the rapture of the Church. The rapture is not a return where we are caught up to meet the Lord in the air. 

##### Jesus's feet will first touch the earth where they left, on the Mount of Olives. Just like Jesus left physically, he will return physically. Acts 1:9-11 

#### Zechariah 14:4c *and the **Mount of Olives will be split** in its middle from east to west by a very large valley,* The instant Jesus touches it, it will split the mountain. 

##### An oil company doing seismic studies found a major fault in this area going east to west precisely through the mount of Olives. It is so severe that it could split at any time. It is waiting for Messiah’s feet to land. Ezekiel 38:19[[70\]](#_ftn72)

####  Zechariah 14:4d *so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.* The mount of Olives will split. Evidently this allows for the remnant to flee Jerusalem and also for the waters to flow. Zechariah 14:8, 13:1; Psalm 46:4; Ezekiel 47:1-12; Revelation 22:1

####  Zechariah 14:5a ***You will flee*** *by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel;* The remnant will flee when this happens. Azel could be a village near Jerusalem. Micah 1:1-11

#### Zechariah 14:5b *yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.* Josephus mentions an earthquake in connection with Uzziah’s sin (pride) as king decided to go into the temple to act as priest. [[71\]](#_ftn73)Amos 1:1

####  Zechariah 14:5c *Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all **the holy ones with Him**!* The holy ones is the church. Revelation 19:14, Revelation 1:6, 5:10

##### Angels will also be coming with Christ. Matthew 25:31, Jude 14, 

##### God’s faithfulness and protective power during this gruesome attack on Jerusalem remind us that our safety does not depend on our distance from danger. Our safety is in God's hands. He keeps us through the most dangerous times we will ever face.

####  Zechariah 14:6 *In that day there will be no light; the **luminaries will dwindle**.* Matthew 24:29, Revelation 16:10

#### Zechariah 14:6 *For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD,* 

#### Zechariah 14:7 *neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. At the point of evening, light comes.* 

##### When it is supposed to be the darkest, it becomes the lightest. Jesus is called the Morning star. 2 Peter 1:19, Revelation 2:28, Revelation 22:16

## Zechariah 14:8-21 - The Millennial Kingdom

#### Zechariah 14:8a *And in that day **living waters will flow out of Jerusalem**,* while the fountain in chapter 13 is spiritual, these waters appear to be life giving waters that flow from east to west. Isaiah 33:21-23, 60:19,20

##### In the day national Israel acknowledges Jesus...these things will come about.

###### The whole kingdom program is riding on Israel's response to their king. The whole earth could believe but if Israel does not, there will be no kingdom. However, though only Israel believe and no one else in the world believe, the kingdom will come. 

###### The kingdom comes after Jesus returns in a literal, physical coming. This does not happen until Israel returns to the Lord. 

#### Zechariah 14:8b *half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea.* 

##### The Mediterranean Sea is referred to as the western sea. The Easter Sea is the Dead Sea, which will no longer be dead. Ezekiel 47:1-12

##### East and West in relation to what? In relation to Israel, and specifically Jerusalem. This is God's compass rose. 

##### Today there is an ongoing battle regarding an area known as the "west bank". West in relation to what? It is not west of Israel; it is west of Jordan. So, from God's perspective that land should be called the "East Bank". Every time we use the term "West Bank" we are using an anti-Israel perspective. It’s better to use terms like Judea and Samaria.[[72\]](#_ftn74)

#### Zechariah 14:8c *it will be in summer as well as in winter. that is, it will never dry up.* During the 1000 years of Christ, these waters will flow year around. 

### **Zechariah 14:9-21 Christ's earthly reign**

#### Zechariah 14:9a *And **the LORD will be king over all the earth**;* Jesus functioning as king is yet future to Zechariah. 

##### Jesus is prophet, priest and king. 

##### In his first coming Jesus carried out the role as prophet. 

##### Today Jesus is acting as high priest at the Father's right hand. 

###### Jesus is sustaining the universe. 

###### Jesus is interceding before the Father

###### Jesus is presenting us as standing before the Father. 

##### In the Millennial age, Jesus Christ will exercise his role and King over all the earth not heaven. Revelation 3:21

##### David's throne is earthly

##### David's throne is in Jerusalem

##### Revelation 20:3 Satan is bound; actual true justice comes to earth. 

##### The Lord will be king...not happening yet. Then He will be king over all the earth. This is not heaven. 

##### It's an earthly restoral of what Adam lost in the garden of Eden. Luke 4

### We must be careful to distinguish the Millennial age from the Eternal state. 

#### The Messianic Reign is Eternal but 1000 years of it is transitional

| **Millennium Age**        | **Eternal State**             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Satan is in the Abyss     | Satan is in the Lake of Fire  |
| Seas                      | No Sea                        |
| Death                     | No death, mourning or pain    |
| Luminaries - Isaiah 30:26 | No sun moon or stars          |
| Temple - Ezekiel 47       | No Temple                     |
| Evil                      | No evil                       |
| Partial curse             | No Curse                      |
| Plagues                   |                               |
| Sin Nature                |                               |
| Salvation by faith        | Faith is no longer, all saved |
| Temporary                 | Eternal                       |
| Transition                |                               |
| Time                      | Timeless                      |
| Rebellion                 |                               |
|                           |                               |

#### The eternal state will NOT include:

##### **Satan** - he is in the lake of fire (not the abyss)

##### **Sea** - Zechariah just mentioned two seas

##### **Death** no mourning or pain - There will be no rebellion ever. That's not what Zechariah is talking about. No reign, no rain. 

##### **Luminaries** - Sun, moon - Isaiah 30:26

##### **Temple** - Ezekiel 47, from the temple will flow waters. 

##### **Evil**, **Curse**, **Sin nature** 

#### Zechariah 14:9b *in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.* He is the only candidate, he is the only one in line, there is not debate, no question, there is no doubt, he is the only one. 

### **Zechariah 14:10-15 The King will arrange His Kingdom**

#### Zechariah 14:10a All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; 

#### Zechariah 14:10b *but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate* Benjamin's gate was in the northern wall of Jerusalem. Isaiah 2:1-4

#### Zechariah 14:10c *as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses.* Jerusalem has risen, but certain things have remained. 

##### These places are specifically mentioned because it means to show us literal, physical locations. 

####  Zechariah 14:11 *People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.* 

##### Jerusalem will be repopulated. Zechariah 8:4-5

##### There will no longer be a curse in Jerusalem. Israel now lives under the New Covenant provision that is not conditioned upon obedience to have blessings or cursed if they disobey. 

##### Not only Jerusalem, but the whole earth will be repopulated. 

### **Zechariah 14:12-15 - Judgment on Nations**

#### Zechariah 14:12a *Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem;* God has a record of the nations that have attacked Israel. 

##### If God promised to bless nations through Israel, why on earth would the nations wants to do anything to disrupt that divine blessing? 

##### A light offense against Israel is returned by God by a heavy offense against the nation. 

##### Exodus 4:22 - God said he would bring plagues against the enemies of Jerusalem. 

#### Zechariah 14:12b *their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.* Nuclear reaction? Chemical weapons? Matthew 24:21-22 - if the 7 year tribulation had gone on, nobody would have lived through it. 

##### Flesh rots while standing on Feet

##### Eyes rot in sockets

##### Tongue rots in mouth

##### Revelation 6:8 75% of the earth is eliminated. 50% world's population is destroyed. 

##### Revelation 11 - Two Witnesses whole world will watch them die and come back to life. This is easily possible today through live television. 

#### Zechariah 14:13a *It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them.* 

##### God causes great panic. Many times, man in a state of fear goes against each other. 

####  Zechariah 14:13b *and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.* 

##### Man starts killing each other. 

##### Judges 7:22 - Gideon didn't have to do much. God caused great fear and they killed each other and fled. 

##### Ezekiel 38:2 - Every sword will be against one another. 

####  Zechariah 14:14a *Judah also will fight at Jerusalem.* 

##### Genesis 49:10 Messiah comes from Judah. The scepter shall not depart from Judah...

##### Micah 5:2, - clans of Judah, little town called Bethlehem. 

####  Zechariah 14:14b *and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.* 

##### Ezekiel 38:12 tells us why the nations attacked Israel. Israel has to be in a state of wealth. Specifically in Silver and gold and clothing in great abundance. 

##### in 1867 Mark Twain said the land was a barren expanse. 

##### In our lifetime Israel has become a nation. 

##### Israel is in the process of becoming phenomenally wealthy. Her gross domestic product is far better than her neighbors.

##### Israel has discovered oil in their land. 

##### Ezekiel 38:12 - 14 

##### Israel's gold from the period of Solomon has been vastly lost. It appears as though the Israeli's hid it. So much so that subsequent generations lost track of it. Will there be an unearthing of the silver and gold that was hidden? The nations will steal it, but eventually God will return it back to them. Zechariah 14:1, 14

####  Zechariah 14:15a *So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel,* These are the enemy animals. Ezekiel 38:4 

##### The landform between Israel and Syria is divided by the Golan Heights. IT is impassable by modern vehicles. It must be passed by horseback. 

##### The Golan Heights now belongs to the people of Israel. 

#### Zechariah 14:15b *the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.* When the plague hits all these animals it will make it difficult for these nations. 

##### The horse is still used in warfare in certain terrain. 

##### The enemy comes into Israel through mountains. What mountains? The Golan Heights would fit that perfectly. 

##### The animals are needed to pass the Golan Heights. [[73\]](#_ftn75)

### Zechariah 14:16-19 Kingdom Worship

#### As Prophet, Priest and poet, Zechariah is given an appropriate way to end the book! 

####  The Nations Worship

#### Zechariah 14:16a *Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem…* There will be some nations left at the end of the Tribulation that went up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 8:20-23; Isaiah 2:2-4; 45:21-24; 60:4-14; Ezekiel 40—48; Philippians 2:10

##### Whoever is left of the nations - two judgments that take place on the earth for tribulation survivors. Some will be saved, some will not. 

##### Unbelievers who survive will be cast off into Hades. Surviving believers will enter the Millennium age. 

##### The Millennium will begin with mortals who happen to survive the Tribulation and are believers. 

##### There is a parallel judgment for surviving Jews that will take place in Acts 20:30-34

##### There will be no unbelieving Jews at this time. 

### 4 Future Judgments for the World



| Bema   | Nations           | Israel         | Great White Throne          |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Church | Remaining nations | Remaining Jews | at the end of the Millenium |

#### Zechariah 14:16b *will go up from year to year to worship the King,* the specific purpose the nations have for going to Jerusalem will be to worship the King. This is a monarchical type of government. The King will be God and that nations will come to render homage to Him. 

##### Jesus' three offices past, present, future



| **Prophet**  | **Priest** | **King**          |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
| Past         | Present    | Future            |
| First Coming | Now Seated | Messianic Kingdom |

##### Isaiah 65:25

##### King Jesus is not reigning yet. This is still future. Just like David was anointed but never actually reigned until Saul was deposed, so too Messiah has been anointed and waiting the time set by God the Father to reign upon His own earthly throne. 1 Samuel 16, 2 Samuel 2, 2 Samuel 5

##### It is not until Satan (as Antichrist) is deposed that Christ will reign. First Messiah receives the title of the earth based on Him being worthy as the Lamb who was slain. Then Antichrist must be chained and thrown into the Abyss, then Messiah will take his rightful place and begin His ministry as King reigning from the city of Jerusalem. 

##### That is why when Satan is released at the end of the Millennium, he goes straight to attack the Beloved City (Jerusalem) because he knows where the authority is. Revelation 20:7-9

#### Zechariah 14:16c *who is the Lord of hosts*...There is no mistaking the identity of this King. He is the Lord of hosts. The Father has bestowed on Him the role as Lord of hosts. Psalm 24:10, Jeremiah 48:15

##### Kingship in Israel was integrated into a theocratic system in which Yahweh alone was considered King and absolute ruler of the universe. Exodus 15.18;19.6; Numbers 23.21; 1 Samuel 8.7; 12.12; Judges 8.23 [[74\]](#_ftn76)

##### The human king was but Yahweh's earthly regent. Yet here see a regent who is the Lord of hosts. That is, this human earthly regent is the universal sovereign. Revelation 19:16, Psalm 24:10 

#### Zechariah 14:16b *and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.* The Feast of Booths of one of three of the most important feasts in the life of Israel. It was a time of grateful rejoicing. Leviticus 23:40, Deuteronomy 16:14-15, Nehemiah 8:17

##### Leviticus 23 gives the Jewish feasts. One of those is the Feast of Booths. It commemorates the provision of the Lord. 

##### Celebrated The Feast of Booths does not imply that the Kingdom is once again under the Mosaic law. 

##### There are usually objections to taking the temple and sacrifices literally. 

##### While there are similarities in the sacrifices, they are different, just like Noah's sacrifices were different from Moses' sacrifices. Those sacrifices all pointed ahead to one who would come. The sacrifices done in the Millennium will point back. 

##### All these differences show that this is not a return to the Law of Moses but is rather a Kingdom Law. How is it different? 



| **Mosaic Law**                   | **Kingdom Law**                                              |

| Relates only to Israel           | Includes Israel, Church and the nations distinctly           |
| No horses allowed                | Horses                                                       |
| Nations unaffected               | Nations only receive rain if they come to feast of booths each  year. |
|                                  |                                                              |

####  This is the only feast that Zechariah mentioned that is celebrated. However, Zechariah 8:19 mentions turning mourning into feasts. 

##### The Apostle Peter mistakenly concluded that the messianic kingdom had begun when he saw Jesus transfigured (Luke 9:33). He suggested that the disciples make three booths for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. This indicates that the Jews in Jesus' day associated the Feast of Booths with the beginning of Messiah's kingdom, which is the same connection that Zechariah made here. [[75\]](#_ftn77)

**Zechariah 14:17-19 Conditions of Kingdom Law to the nations**

####  Zechariah 14:17a *And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem* Clearly Jerusalem is a literal city. The families of the earth are the remaining people of the nations of the world.

####  Zechariah 14:17b *to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.* They will come to Jerusalem for the express purpose of worshipping the King. Matthew 2:6

##### First the eternal Angel of the Lord was seen to be a man. Then we see the man presented as a King. Now the King is presented as the Lord of Hosts and reigning in Jerusalem. Nations will come to him to worship. Matthew 2:2 

##### Unlike any other king in the history of mankind, this King holds the world in His hands. He controls the wind and the rain. This will cause people to fear him as it did the disciples. Mark 4:39-41

##### The nations will need to walk by faith just like they have in any other age. They will need to trust in Messiah for salvation for what He did on calvary, They will need to walk by faith trusting in Messiah's provision over the power of sin and also trust in Messiah to provide their material needs. 

##### Failure to keep Kingdom law results in curses. Specifically in this case, they will get no rain.

## The Millennial Kingdom – three distinct parts; Israel, Church and Nations

### This new age brings God's fulfilment of the New Covenant to Israel and Judah who will be a united nation. Jeremiah 31:31

##### At the same time, in her glorified state, the ministering of New Covenant administration will be responsibility of the Church. 

##### Messiah deals with the nations in terms of blessings and curses depending on their relation to Him. 

##### For Israel, as light unto the Gentiles, she will keep temple ritual.

#### Zechariah 14:18a *If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them;* Egypt is a nation mentioned by name. In the millenium, Egypt will depent on God’s provision for rain, otherwise they will be cursed. 

#### Zechariah 14:18b *it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.* God has turned the tables. Egypt is now dependent on Israel's King to survive. They must render homage every year to the King in Jerusalem, otherwise they are not sent any rain. 

####  Zechariah 14:19 *This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.* Any nation who does not trust in the Lord to present themselves before the Lord on the Feast of Booths, will not receive any rain the following year. 

### **Zechariah 14:20-21 The Holiness of The King will prevail**

#### Zechariah 14:20a *In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD."* Since Egypt has been given her rightful place in relation to Israel, we now see horses used in Israel. The horses are seen to contribute to the glorification of the LORD. 

##### In the kingdom, instead of using the horses to fight, they are used to ring bells that read "Holy to the Lord". 

##### This speaks of a new dispensation no longer under the law. Under the law, Israel was prohibited to own horses. If one point of the law must be changed, the whole law is affected. James 2:10

##### Therefore, we conclude this must be a new administration, the fulfillment of the New Covenant, no longer under Mosaic law but a multi-program administration under the Spirit of grace and supplication where priesthood and royalty are joined in one office characterized by a rule of peace and a rod of iron. 

##### This is a new administration where God includes Christ as King of the nations, Israel as His dearest subjugates, Jerusalem as His capital city, Zion the mountain of his throne, the Church as His beautiful queen and the angels as his personal ministers.

##### During the age of Law, only the turban of the priest held an inscription, "*holy to the Lord*". Exodus 28:36

##### During the 1000 year reign of Christ, even the minutest things like bells on horses will be considered set apart for the worship of the Lord. The point is, worship is an integral part of life, all-inclusive unto the Lord. 

##### The new means of walking will proceed from Zion in Jerusalem, not Sinai. Isaiah 2:1‑4

##### The whole life will be pervaded by the holiness of the LORD. The people will then be the holy nation that God has always envisioned. Exodus 19:6 [[76\]](#_ftn78)

#### Zechariah 14:20b *And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar.* Here the cooking pots in the temple are likened to the 100 bowls in the temple. 2 Chronicles 4:8 

#### Zechariah 14:21a *Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts;* Every pot throughout the land will be usable. Not just those set apart for use in the temple. 

####  Zechariah 14:21b *and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.* Every pot in the land will be usable for cooking the sacrifice. The implication is that all are sacrificing not just the priest as seen in Levitical law. Leviticus 6:24-28

####  Zechariah 14:21c *And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.* Genesis 9:25-27, Isaiah 35:8, Ezekiel 43:7, 44:9; Revelation 21:27

##### The house of the Lord is referring to the 4th Temple of the Millennium. Canaanites will be no more. Deuteronomy 23:3-4

##### Revelation 11:5 "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ; and He will reign forever and ever." Zechariah 14:9

 

Major climactic breakthrough at end.

In the end we all will say Israel suffered a lot. Israel will reply yes, but we are so glad God used it to bless us. In fact their suffering will be light compared to the heavy weight of the millennial and eternal blessings.



God knows whay we need when we’re sick.
Feast of booths levels all classes of life.


# VI.Doctrines in Zechariah

\ The Day of the Lord – an eschatological period of time that starts some point after the rapture and ends at the end of the Millennium. 

\ The Second coming – This is the return to the Mount of Olives of the Lord Jesus at the end of the Tribulation. 

\ The Tribulation – Daniel announced 70 weeks would pass before Messiah’s reign to be established. 69 weeks have passed. The last week is known as The Tribulation. 

\ Armageddon. Often refers to the final battle at the end of the Tribulation when the nations go against Jerusalem. Actually Armageddon (Harm-Megiddo) is the place where the nations will meet. The actual war will take place in Jerusalem. Revelation 16:14-16

\ Gog and Magog. Ezekiel 38-39

\ New Covenant - It is commonly understood that the New Covenant is now, for the church. That cannot be for several reasons: The New Covenant was promised to the house of Judah and the house of Israel. Jeremiah 31:31. The New Covenant conditions have not been met. The New Covenant promises have not been fulfilled. The Church program has not replaced God's program for Israel. God's promises must be fulfilled with the nation of Israel in order to fulfill the many prophecies and, "then you will know I am the Lord".

It is to abide where it originated and where it has always belonged. The cycle of wickedness, as it were, is complete. Godlessness in every form has finally come home.

[[26\]](#_ftnref26) John F. Walvoord The predictions of Isaiah have to do with Babylon’s ultimate destruction in the Day of the Lord. The near and the far view are often mingled as in chapter 13. The destruction of Babylon is pictured in Isaiah 13:1-11 as part of God’s program to punish the entire world (cp. 13:11). The historic conquering of Babylon by the Medes and the Persians is mentioned specifically in Isaiah 13:17-19 The prophet seems to refer to the far view, that is, the destruction of Babylon in relation to the second coming of Christ. Isaiah 13:20-22.

[[27\]](#_ftnref27) John F. Walvoord the prophecies of Jeremiah are notable because they were delivered at the peak of Babylon’s power when it seemed most unlikely that the great nation would fall. Babylon is pictured as being punished because of its cruel treatment of Israel (50:17, 18; 51:24, 49).Practically all of the predictions of Jeremiah seem to relate to the fall of Babylon by the attack of the Medes and the Persians. Only occasionally does there seem to be a reference to a future ultimate destruction as in Jeremiah 51:62-64. The prophecies of Jeremiah predicting the fall of Babylon at the hands of the Medes and the Persians were graphically fulfilled approximately sixty-five years later, as recorded in Daniel 5

First over the wall was Faustus Cornelius Sulla, the son of the former dictator and a senior officer in Pompey's army. He was followed by two centurions, Furius and Fabius, who each led a cohort, and the Romans soon overcame the defending Jews, 12,000 of whom were slaughtered. However, only a few Romans troops were killed. Pompey himself entered the Temple's Holy of Holies, which only the High Priest was allowed to enter, and thus desecrated it. He did not remove anything, neither its treasures nor any funds, and the next day, he ordered the Temple cleansed and its rituals resumed. Pompey then headed back to Rome and took Aristobulus with him for his triumphal procession.
