# Psalm 36

[**Psa 36:1** ](verseid:19.36.1) **For the choir director. \*A Psalm\* of David the servant of the LORD.**Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes.

[**Psa 36:2** ](verseid:19.36.2) For it flatters him in his *own* eyes Concerning the discovery of his iniquity *and* the hatred *of it.*

[**Psa 36:3** ](verseid:19.36.3) The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise *and* to do good.

[**Psa 36:4** ](verseid:19.36.4) He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil.

[**Psa 36:5** ](verseid:19.36.5) Your lovingkindness, O LORD, extends to the heavens, Your faithfulness *reaches* to the skies.

[**Psa 36:6** ](verseid:19.36.6) Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your judgments are *like*a great deep. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.

[**Psa 36:7** ](verseid:19.36.7) How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings.

[**Psa 36:8** ](verseid:19.36.8) They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house; And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights.

[**Psa 36:9** ](verseid:19.36.9) For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light.

[**Psa 36:10** ](verseid:19.36.10) O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart.

[**Psa 36:11** ](verseid:19.36.11) Let not the foot of pride come upon me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.

[**Psa 36:12** ](verseid:19.36.12) There the doers of iniquity have fallen; They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
