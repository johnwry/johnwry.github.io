[**Joh 13:21** ](verseid:43.13.21) When Jesus had said this, He became troubled in spirit, and testified and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."

[**Joh 13:22** ](verseid:43.13.22) The disciples *began* looking at one another, at a loss *to know* of which one He was speaking.

[**Joh 13:23** ](verseid:43.13.23) There was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.

[**Joh 13:24** ](verseid:43.13.24) So Simon Peter *gestured to him, and *said to him, "Tell *us* who it is of whom He is speaking."

[**Joh 13:25** ](verseid:43.13.25) He, leaning back thus on Jesus' bosom, *said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"

[**Joh 13:26** ](verseid:43.13.26) Jesus then *answered, "That is the one for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him." So when He had dipped the morsel, He *took and *gave it to Judas, *the son* of Simon Iscariot.

[**Joh 13:27** ](verseid:43.13.27) After the morsel, Satan then entered into him. Therefore Jesus *said to him, "What you do, do quickly."

[**Joh 13:28** ](verseid:43.13.28) Now no one of those reclining *at the table* knew for what purpose He had said this to him.

[**Joh 13:29** ](verseid:43.13.29) For some were supposing, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast"; or else, that he should give something to the poor.

[**Joh 13:30** ](verseid:43.13.30) So after receiving the morsel he went out immediately; and it was night.

## A New Commandment

[**Joh 13:31** ](verseid:43.13.31) Therefore when he had gone out, Jesus *said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;

[**Joh 13:32** ](verseid:43.13.32) if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.

[**Joh 13:33** ](verseid:43.13.33) "Little children, I am with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.'

[**Joh 13:34** ](verseid:43.13.34) "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

[**Joh 13:35** ](verseid:43.13.35) "By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."

## Jesus Foretells Peter's Denial

[**Joh 13:36** ](verseid:43.13.36) Simon Peter *said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?" Jesus answered, "Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later."

[**Joh 13:37** ](verseid:43.13.37) Peter *said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You."

[**Joh 13:38** ](verseid:43.13.38) Jesus *answered, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.
