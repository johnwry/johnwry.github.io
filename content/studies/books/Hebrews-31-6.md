[**Heb 3:1** ](verseid:58.3.1) Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;

[**Heb 3:2** ](verseid:58.3.2) He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.

[**Heb 3:3** ](verseid:58.3.3) For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.

[**Heb 3:4** ](verseid:58.3.4) For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.

[**Heb 3:5** ](verseid:58.3.5) Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;

[**Heb 3:6** ](verseid:58.3.6) but Christ *was faithful* as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.

Therefore, 

​	holy brethren, 

​	partakers of a heavenly calling, 

consider Jesus, 

​	the Apostle 

​	and High Priest 

​	of our confession;

He was faithful 

​	to Him 

​		who appointed Him, 

​			as Moses also was 

​			in all His house.

> *Scholars tell us that this Pharaoh had a son, who because he was physically and mentally handicapped, was considered incapable of assuming the royal prerogatives to which he had been born. When he ascended the throne as Thothmes II, his sister Hatshepsut became regent and actually ruled the country. Thothmes II eventually died without a legitimate heir, but because both his father and sister had foreseen this lack of a successor, they probably had determined long beforehand that Moses would be the eventual heir. So from earliest years Moses had been educated with this in mind, as Stephen declares: “Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds” (Acts 7:22).*
>
> *When her brother died, it appears that Hatshepsut retained supreme authority as regent in Egypt and indicated her intention of placing Moses, her adopted son, on the throne as her successor. To legitimize this, she had planned to marry Moses to her elder daughter, Nepherus. Moses, however, apparently both refused the throne and the bride, and thus sacrificed his position in the kingdom and the honor and the wealth that went with it.*

> [**Heb 11:27-29** ](verseid:58.11.27) By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though *they were passing* through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.

​	For He has been counted worthy 

​		of more glory than Moses, 

​		by just so much 

​		as the builder of the house 

​		has more honor than the house.

For every house 

is built by someone, 

but the builder of all things is God.

Now Moses was faithful in all His house 

​	as a servant, 

​	for a testimony of those things 

​	which were to be spoken later; 

[**Jhn 1:45** ](verseid:43.1.45) Philip *found Nathanael and *said to him, "We have found Him of whom Moses in the Law and *also* the Prophets wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."

[**Jhn 1:46** ](verseid:43.1.46) Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" Philip *said to him, "Come and see."

[**Jhn 1:47** ](verseid:43.1.47) Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and *said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no deceit!"

[**Jhn 1:48** ](verseid:43.1.48) Nathanael *said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."

[**Jhn 1:49** ](verseid:43.1.49) Nathanael answered Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel."

[**Jhn 1:17** ](verseid:43.1.17) For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.

but Christ *was faithful* as a Son 

​	over His house—

​	whose house we are, 

​		if we hold fast 

​			our confidence 

​			and the boast 

​			of our hope 

​			firm until the end.

====4:11-16

[**Heb 4:11** ](verseid:58.4.11) Therefore let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall, through *following* the same example of disobedience.

[**Heb 4:12** ](verseid:58.4.12) For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

[**Heb 4:13** ](verseid:58.4.13) And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.

[**Heb 4:14** ](verseid:58.4.14) Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.

[**Heb 4:15** ](verseid:58.4.15) For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as *we are, yet*without sin.

[**Heb 4:16** ](verseid:58.4.16) Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
