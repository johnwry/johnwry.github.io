Title: "Hebrews 3:1-6"

[**Heb 3:1** ](verseid:58.3.1) Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession;

[**Heb 3:2** ](verseid:58.3.2) He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.

[**Heb 3:3** ](verseid:58.3.3) For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house.

[**Heb 3:4** ](verseid:58.3.4) For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.

[**Heb 3:5** ](verseid:58.3.5) Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;

[**Heb 3:6** ](verseid:58.3.6) but Christ *was faithful* as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.

> *Scholars tell us that this Pharaoh had a son, who because he was physically and mentally handicapped, was considered incapable of assuming the royal prerogatives to which he had been born. When he ascended the throne as Thothmes II, his sister Hatshepsut became regent and actually ruled the country. Thothmes II eventually died without a legitimate heir, but because both his father and sister had foreseen this lack of a successor, they probably had determined long beforehand that Moses would be the eventual heir. So from earliest years Moses had been educated with this in mind, as Stephen declares: “Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds” (Acts 7:22).*
>
> *When her brother died, it appears that Hatshepsut retained supreme authority as regent in Egypt and indicated her intention of placing Moses, her adopted son, on the throne as her successor. To legitimize this, she had planned to marry Moses to her elder daughter, Nepherus. Moses, however, apparently both refused the throne and the bride, and thus sacrificed his position in the kingdom and the honor and the wealth that went with it.*

​	For He has been counted worthy 

​		of more glory than Moses, 

​		by just so much 

​		as the builder of the house 

​		has more honor than the house.

For every house 

is built by someone, 

but the builder of all things is God.

Now Moses was faithful in all His house 

​	as a servant, 

​	for a testimony of those things 

​	which were to be spoken later; 

but Christ *was faithful* as a Son 

​	over His house—

​	whose house we are, 

​		if we hold fast 

​			our confidence 

​			and the boast 

​			of our hope 

​			firm until the end.
