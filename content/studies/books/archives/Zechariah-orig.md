# Zechariah 
## The Story of Israel's Return

---

> Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!...For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will *their* acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15  

In Ezekiel 23 God tells a story of two young sisters who He takes on as wives. The older sister, Oholah, desired what the Assyrians had to offer and she gave herself in harlotry to them.  The younger sister, Oholibah was even worse and gave herself in like manner to the Babylonians. Both women committed abominable acts of harlotry. The two women are an allegory of Israel and Judah giving themselves in idolatry to the nations. 

The book of Zechariah contains a powerful message to the reader. One's view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does. It contains theologial teaching, spiritual uplifting and eschotological information that presents the Messiah in a unique way as the eternal

Zechariah  is a beautiful reminder of who God is, how His plan will be carried out through and some details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.

God is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God's redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah. 

Under the current circumstances it would appear as though God had forgotten Israel. Zechariah (*Yahweh remembers*) son of Berechiah (*Yahweh blesses*) and grandson of Iddo (*appointed time*). This offer is always before Israel yet they reject Him over and over. Eventually Israel will be brought through a great Tribulation and only then will the the prophecies of Zechariah be fully accomplished. It will be when God remembers Israel at His appointed time and where the blessings will never fade away again.

# I. The Background of Zechariah

## A. Historical setting

### 1. Along with Haggai and Malachi, Zechariah is a **post**-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C. 

#### a. The Jews have returned back in the land for about 18 years after being **exiled** for 70 years in Babylon. 

#### b. Medo-Persia has overthrown the Babylonians and under Cyrus the Persian the command was given for the Jews to be allowed to go back. Ezra 2

#### b. Zerubbabel has been **placed** in charge as governor and is given some finances for the rebuilding of the temple. Ezra 3:7-8

### 2. Upon first arriving, the Jews immediately set to build an altar to **renew** the sacrifices. Following that, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple. Ezra 3:1-6

#### a. This caused a lot of interest on behalf of the Samaritans who wanted to help **rebuild** the temple. Their help was refused because though they feared God, they served other gods as well. Ezra 4:1-3, 2 Kings 17:33

#### b. When the Jews refused their help however, they proceeded to make all sorts of **trouble**, telling the persian king that they should be prohibited to rebuild. Ezra 4:4-24

#### c. Somehow, in the change of power, the command to go back and rebuild was **lost** and the current king, Darius I had to go back through years of records and verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12

### 3. After about 16 years of waiting, with king Darius I finding Cyrus's **decree** the rebuilding of the temple continues. Ezra 6:1-5 

### 4. Two months prior to the prophecy of Zechariah, God had told the Jews through the prophet Haggai to **begin** work again on the temple. The Jews are discouraged and have lost hope. 

### 5. The message of Zechariah is one that is intended to encourage Israel not only to return to the **land** and to rebuild the temple but more importantly, to a spiritual return to the Lord.  

### 6. Though the intent of Zechariah does not seem to give a historical narrative, a general sense seems to be the following...

##### a. Chapters 1-8 deal Israel under Medo-Persian rule 

##### b. Chapters 9-10 Israel governed by Greece 

##### c. Chapter 11 Israel under Roman domination 

##### d. Chapters 12 to 14 Israel's last days of national history

## C. Why study the book of Zechariah? 

### 1. The book of Zechariah is written directly to the Jews who were returning back to the land from the 70 year **exile** in Babylon. 

#### a.  It is a message of encouragement, of **hope** and and restoration. 

#### b. It is because of the prophecies of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the **temple** continued and after 4 years was completed. Ezra 6:14

### 2. We would do well to learn from this book. The New Testament __<b>quotes</b>__ or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.  

#### a. Not only does it **unfold** details of prophecy, it reveals behind-the-scenes spiritual warfare 

#### b. It **shows** how God is in control and never forgets his promises  

#### c. Most importantly, it **reveals** to us the person of Christ (Revelation 19:10). 

#### d. It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father **prior** to his first coming. 

#### e. It shows us his nature during his first coming and finally his galant **entry** and conquest on his second return as conquering king. 

#### f. It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological unfolding of the **future** but rather to present to us the very purpose of prophecy - the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God's plan of restoration. 

#### g. Zechariah's immediate audience as well as the generations to follow, including the church age, would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He **chose** to make unconditional promises to Abraham and He will keep his word. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally. Genesis 12:1-3,

### 3. Zechariah is a book that is **seldom** taught as it undoubtedly presents the interpreter with many challenges. 

#### a. While Zechariah presents many future events and gives details regarding those events, the key to understanding Zechariah is not to **reveal** future historical narrative. Instead all the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God's Messiah, Christ the Lord. 

# II. Zechariah 1:1-6 - The First Message - Introduction, God's call to return 

## A. Zechariah 1:1-2 Date and Author 

### 1. Zechariah 1:1a *In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,…* Cyrus was the Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the **writing** of Zechariah in 520 B.C.. 

#### a. The dating is not according to a Jewish leader as is seen in many Old Testament books. No Jewish king is reigning and Jerusalem is being **trampled** underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24

##### 1) Perhaps many in Israel thought Messiah would come at this time since the 70 years of Jeremiah's prophecy were complete and there was a wave of people gathering back to the **land**. Daniel 9:1-19

###### i) Cyrus was mistakenly called Messiah by the people because he let them return to the land. However, it was God using Cyrus (an unbeliever) as His instrument to **return** the people back to their land. Isaiah 45:1-5

### 2. Zechariah 1:1b *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,…* Zechariah was a **levite**, born in Babylon (Nehemiah 12:1, 16). Zechariah means Yahweh remembers. 

#### a. Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah is both **priest** (Nehemiah 12:16) and prophet. Ezra 5:1, 6:14

#### b. Zechariah is probably a **young** man.  Zechariah 2:4

##### 2) Haggai prophesied in September, October and December. However, Zechariah's first prophecy was in November. Zechariah's prophecy complemented the message given by an **older** prophet. 

#### c. Some scholars **ascribe** Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah. 

### 3. Zechariah 1:1c *the son of Berechiah,…* Berechiah was Zechariah's father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra. Not much else is known about Berechiah except that his **name** means Yahweh blesses. 

#### a. Curiously, Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called *Zechariah son of Berechiah* in  Matthew 23:35. 

##### 1) Option 1: A case of mixed identity. There was another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was **killed** by the people (2 Chronicles 24:20-22). Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. This theory claims since they mean the __<u>same</u>__, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus. 

##### 2) Option 2: Same ancestors. Both Zechariah's may have had fathers __<u>named</u>__ Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually somewhere in Zechariah's geneology. 

##### 3) Option 3: Copying error. An copyists's __<u>error</u>__ in transcription of the Greek text.

##### 4) Option 4: Only God witnessed it. Though no one else saw, Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah's __<u>murder</u>__, just the same as he did Abel's. This seems the most plausible option of the 4. 

###### i) The Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also states that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. The **rabbis** would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus. 

###### ii) Matthew seems familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus __<u>mention</u>__ it this way.  

###### iii) God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He sees all that is **done** in public as well as in secret. Ultimately he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20

### 4. Zechariah 1:1d *the son of Iddo…* Iddo is Zechariah's grandfather.  His **name** means the appointed time. 

#### a. Iddo was a priest. Iddo is __<u>listed</u>__ among those who returned from Babylon.  Nehemiah 12:1, 12:4, 12:16

#### b. Zechariah is also referred to as the **son** of Iddo. This is common practice in the Old Testament to say his forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14 

#### Like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Zechariah is also a prophet and priest. 

### 5. Together, the names of Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say,  "*Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time*".  When the set **time** comes, God will fulfill all His promises and they will be carried out with overflowing blessing. 

## B. Zechariah 1:2-3 Thesis of the book, "*return to Me and I will return to you*"
### 1. Zechariah 1:2 *"The LORD was very angry with your fathers.…*  the **fathers** are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36

### 2. Zechariah 1:3a *"Therefore say to them,…*  Zechariah's primary audience are the **people** who have returned from exile in Babylon. 

### 3. Zechariah 1:3b *Thus says the LORD of hosts*... Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts' __<u>word</u>__ to the people.  

#### a. this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua. 

#### b. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God's __<u>word</u>__.  Hebrews 1:1, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:20-21

#### c. When God speaks something, He is **tied** to His Word to fulfill it. Ezra 1:1, Proverbs 30:5, Hebrews 6:17-18, 

### 4. **THE LORD OF HOSTS (Yahweh Saboath):** 

#### a. The *Lord of Hosts* is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. In order to properly understand the **book** of Zechariah we must get better acquainted with this name. 

#### b. THE LORD OF HOST IS **COMMANDER OF ARMIES**

##### 1) (Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of **armies** used 235 times in the Bible). 
###### i) Tza-va (צבא ) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the **plural**, referring to multiple armies of which include angelic beings. 

##### 2) Isaiah 13:4  *...The LORD of hosts is mustering the **army** for battle.* Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, **Isaiah** 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3 

##### 3) 1 Kings 22:19  *...I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many.*

##### 4) Isaiah 19:16 *...they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts...Awake to punish all the **nations**...* Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7

##### 5) Nahum 2:13  "*Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will **burn** up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.*" Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matthew 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20

##### 6) Luke 2:13 *And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying...* Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53

##### 7. Isaiah 37:35-36 *'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.'" Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead.*

#### c. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **KING**:

##### 1) Psalm 24:10 *Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah*. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19

##### 2) Isaiah 9:7 *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.*

##### 3) Isaiah 28:5  *In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people;* 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14

#### d. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **THE REDEEMER**:

##### 1) Isaiah 47:4 *Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel.*

##### 2) Isaiah 44:6 "*Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me.* Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5

##### 3) Psalm 84:1-12 ....*How blessed is the man who trusts in You!*

#### e. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **HOLY**:

##### 1) Isaiah 6:3 "*Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.*" Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16

#### f. The LORD OF HOSTS is **ALMIGHTY**:

##### 1) *"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN & among the inhabitants of earth & no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, 'What have You done?"* Daniel 4:35

##### 2) Hannah is the **first** person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. 1 Samuel 1

##### 3) David **invokes** the Lord of Hosts when going to battle with Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10

###### i) Though David didn't use  Saul's  **armor**, he put on the Lord of Hosts. 

###### ii) *David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him.* 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27

#### g. The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in understanding that it is the *Lord of Hosts* who is actively involved with the protection, provision and ultimate destiny of **Israel**. He is the Almighty, great Commander, the One who has all resources at his disposal and battles in favour of his people. 

##### 1) Zechariah's message **comes** directly from the Lord of hosts himself..."*thus says the Lord of hosts*" This is __<u>crucial</u>__ to see to properly understand the message.

##### 2) It is the Lord of **Hosts** who will ultimately not allow injustice to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8

##### 3) When Christ is seated on His **throne**, His name will be called *the Lord of Hosts*. Zechariah 14:16-17 

### 5. Zechariah 1:3c *"Return to Me,"…*  While Haggai is more focused on the return to the land and the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah's message is to encourage the people to return in a **right** relationship with God. 

#### a. The Jews needed to **place** their focus and trust in the giver and purpose of the temple, not the temple itself. 1 John 3:3

##### Zephaniah  3:1  *Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!*

##### Zephaniah  3:2  *She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; **she trusted not in the LORD**; she drew not near to her God.*

#### c. The opposite of return is to __<u>forsake</u>__. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and turned to trust in other things. 

### 6. Zechariah 1:3d *declares the LORD of hosts,…*  The Lord of hosts commands Israel to **return**, not merely to the land, the law and all the ordinances, but to Himself. 

#### a. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are coming back in the **land**, they have already rebuilt the altar and restored the daily sacrifices.  The foundation for the temple is laid. Thing seemily are going well, apart from a little annoyance from the Samaritans, God is blessing the nation. 

#### b. Haggai's prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and especially the temple.  Yet in Zechariah, God is saying that in order for things to be **good** with Him, the jews must first of all return to Him spiritually. This, perhaps was overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances. 

#### c. So, when trials comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, **trusting** the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11  

### 7. Zechariah 1:1 *"that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts...* What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God's **presence** among the people. 

#### a. The Lord of hosts is **inviting** Israel to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart with himself.



## C. Zechariah 1:4-6 An Illustration showing the antithesis of returning to the Lord

### 1. In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will say to the Jews what "*return to me*" is **not**. 

### 2. Zechariah 1:4a *"Do not be like your fathers,…* Remember you fathers **bad** example? 2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8 

##### a. In other words God says, when I say "*return to me*" it is the **opposite** to what your fathers had done, don't be like that!. 

### 3. Zechariah 1:4b *to whom the former prophets proclaimed,…* namely; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, **Joel**, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10 

### 3. Zechariah 1:4c *saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."'…*Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10  

#### at this point many are prone to say, if Israel would have ceased from sinning, God would have returned. That is not what this is saying. A return to God is not synonymous with being sinless. A return to God is by **faith** in God who accepts us on the basis of The Sinless One who paid for our sins. There is no other means to turn to God. 

#### In chapter 3 we see a delightful **scene** when the Joshua de high priest is given new clothes after having soiled his. Yet it is God who changes his clothes standing in his presence. 

#### Evil ways, and evil deeds here refers to their trusting in **idols**, forsaking the Lord, depending on other things rather than to God. 

### 5. Zechariah 1:4d *But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD.…* They weren't deaf or somehow unaware of God speaking time and time again through the prophets. They were rebellious and refused to **listen**. Jeremiah 44:16 

#### a. Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place.  A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil __<u>things</u>__ but a return to fellowship. 

##### 1) A __<u>return</u>__ to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 

#### b. God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious __<u>rote</u>__. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27,  Colossians 2:23 

#### c. God hates religious rote as a replacement for a __<u>relationship</u>__. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4

##### 1) It is counted as **violence** to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4

##### 2) In Acts 17:22 Paul says these **words** about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. *So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects*. Jeremiah 10:2, Acts 28:3-4, Acts 17:23

#### d. This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. The arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be **rebuilt**. Haggai 1:2

##### 1) Once again, God disciplined them with a **drought** and still they did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17

### 6. Zechariah 1:5a *"Your fathers, where are they?…*  The **fathers** had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10

### 7. Zechariah 1:5b *And the prophets, do they live forever?…*  Some prophets were **killed** by the very people they prophecied to.

#### a. God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God's offer of  __<u>salvatión</u>__ is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2

### 8. Zechariah 1:6a *"But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets,…*  

### 9. Zechariah 1:6b *overtake your fathers?…*  Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still **sends** more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God's commands are still the same, even today

### 10. Zechariah 1:6c *Then they repented and said,…*  the word for repent (SHUB) could be better translated here "returned" as it's referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. Compare the use of __<u>SHUB</u>__ in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6

### 11. Zechariah 1:6d *As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.…*  

#### a. 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred **singers** . This including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2, Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70 

#### b. Though many returned physically, their focus was on the land and the temple and on the blessings, not on the **giver** of those blessings.  "*Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.*' Jeremiah 7:4, 8

### 12. A NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct **response** to the Gospel. 

#### a. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe based his translation on Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source. The **Latin** vulgate Bible unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. 

##### 1) This doctrine was  what was being **taught** by the Roman Church, which required doing penance to be forgiven. 

##### 2. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel profound sorrow, be penitent) replaced the original **Greek** word metanoia (change your mind). 

#### b. We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much **clearer** to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. 

#### c. They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them.  This is the **wrong** attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. 

##### 1) That is why Christ came and **died** on a cross. His death is the payment for all sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God. 

##### 2) Israel needed approach God by faith. To merely **admit** sinning and accepting the consequences from God is not the same as approaching God by faith. One must trust in God's provision for sin. 

#### d. The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of __<u>thinking</u>__, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said.  Ezekiel 20:43 

##### 1) It's not merely recognizing the __<u>wrong</u>__ you have done. It's not merely admiting you're guilty, it's trusting God for the solution. Matthew 27:3-5

##### 2) It's not feeling __<u>sorrow</u>__ for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. 

##### 3) It is true that God's kindness or godly sorrow leads to repentance but they are not one in the **same** thing, one leads to the other. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9

##### 4) It's not ceasing from __<u>sin</u>__, promising not to sin or changing one's life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase "repent of your sins" is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says "*repent **for** the forgiveness of sins*" which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.  

##### 5) It's not something you __<u>measure</u>__ to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance.  This is a common misconception that still plagues Christianity today.  The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not are not a requirement by God for the internal to be authentic.  Luke 3:8-18, 

##### 6) Salvation is by faith in the Gospel. Salvation is not by works, lest any man should **boast**. Ephesians 2:8-9

##### 6) Biblical repentance is changing one's __<u>mind</u>__  towards God, you change your thinking from what you are trusting in to trust God. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1

##### 7) For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God's offer made through the __<u>Gospel</u>__ (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5

##### 8) Or for a believer in error should __<u>repent</u>__ (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16

##### 9) The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning **Jews** from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him.  

##### 10) Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And **honor** Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote,* 

##### Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the **wisdom** of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed." 

##### Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are done in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?" You turn things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its **maker**, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"? 

##### 11) God wanted this Zechariah's generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be **prone** to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith. 

##### 12) "*Return to me and I will return to you*" - God

##### 13) “*Draw near to God and He will draw near to you*”. James 4:8 NKJV

# III. Zechariah 1:1-6 - The **Second** Message: Eight **visions** - God works all things for Israel's return

### A. Zechariah received 8 visions in one **night**. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some parts were fulfilled within the near future but most of the prophecies contained in the visions have yet to be fulfilled even today. 

### B. These night visions serve the primary purpose of revealing to the people, God's involvement behind the scenes to make Israel and Judah's return to Him a reality. 

### C. These visions serve to encourage the people of Zechariah's time to **finish** building the temple. The temple is important for so many reasons within the existence of the Jews but a key reason is so that prophecy regarding Messiah might be fulfilled.

### D. They also serve to give hope to future generations as the visions unveil how God is compassionately and faithfully fighting for Israel and of His plans to make Israel the epicenter of the world.

### E. We will try not to discifer **every** detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know. 

#### 1. Each of the visions follow a similar pattern. 

##### a. Zechariah says what he **saw**

##### b. Zechariah asks what it **means**

##### c. Zechariah is **told** the significance

| | Passage | Vision | Meaning                         |
| -- | --|:------------------------ | :----------------------------- |

## **A. Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the Horsemen**

#### 1. Zechariah 1:7a *On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month*, in the Bible there are no Hebrew **names** given for months.  The names we have were acquired from the Babylonians. 

##### a. Moses **gave** the law to the second generation on the "11th month". Deuteronomy 1:3

#### 2. Zechariah 1:7b *which is the month Shebat*, Shebat is the aquired Babylonian **name** for the eleventh month. 

##### a. This is the time of **year** when winter is on its way out in Israel.  

#### 3. Zechariah 1:7c *in the second year of Darius*, this is Darius I who succeeded Cyrus's son to the **throne**. 

#### 4. Zechariah 1:7d *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah,the son of Iddo,* this is three months after receiving the **first** message. 

##### a. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight **visions** in one night.

##### b. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was **later** compiled together to form all of Zechariah's prophecies.

#### 5. Zechariah 1:7-8a ...*as follows: I **saw** at night,* This was not a dream. He was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was **how** God communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6

#### 6. Zechariah 1:8b *and behold, a man was riding*...This man is one of the riders but appears to take a more prominent role. There were other coloured **horses** behind him. Twice Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. Revelation 6:4, Revelation 19:11-16, 19-21

##### The humanity of Messiah

###### Genesis 3:15 - A **male** seed of the woman

###### John 1:14 - The eternal God put on **humanity**. Revelation 22:13, 16 

#### 7. Zechariah 1:8c *...on a red horse*, we cannot be dogmatic but generally speaking **red** seems to symbolize blood as a result of war.  

##### a. Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often **seen** in context of war. 

##### b. The color red could be in connection with **blood** and or war. 

##### c. In Revelation 6:4 we see a red **horse** coming to take peace and cause war and bloodshed. 

#### 8. Zechariah 1:8d *and he was standing among the myrtle trees*  It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing **among** the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees. 

##### a. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther's Hebrew **name** (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 

##### c.  In the New Covenant promises to Israel, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into **myrtle** trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19

###### i) Myrtle branches are used during the celebration of the **feast** of tabernacles/booths. 

#### 9. Zechariah 1:8e *which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.* Red, **sorrel** and white horses behind him

#### 10. Zechariah 1:9a *Then I said, "My lord, what are these?"* Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw. 

#### 11. Zechariah 1:9b *And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,"I will show you what these are."* It is not the receptor's task to guess what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1

#### 12. Zechariah 1:10a *And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,* Twice we are told this rider is a man. He enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision...

#### 13. Zechariah 1:10b *"These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.*" The horses here most likely represent angelic beings sent by the Lord. 

##### a. This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7 

##### b. We know from Job 1:6-7 that angelic beings are roaming the earth. 

#### 14. Zechariah 1:11a *So they answered the angel of the LORD* This is the first mention of "*the angel of the Lord*" in Zechariah. 

##### *The ANGEL OF THE LORD* can be seen 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article *the* helps identify He is singular. Scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead (the preincarnate Christ), who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth. 

##### a. This “*man among the myrtle trees*” appears to be the same as the angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13). 

##### b. The Angel of the Lord appeared other times: 

###### i) to comfort **Hagar**. Genesis 16:7–14 

###### ii) to stop **Abraham** from sacrificing Isaac. Genesis 18; 22:11–18 

###### iii) to wrestle with **Jacob**. Genesis 31:11, 13 

###### iv) to call **Moses**. Exodus 3 

###### v) to talk sense into **Balaam**. Numbers 22

###### vi) to prepare **Gideon** for battle. Judges 6:11–23 

###### vii) And six times in **Zechariah**. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8

##### c. The Angel of the Lord will one day destroy the nations that go up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8

#### 15. Zechariah 1:11b *They answered the man ..."We have patrolled the earth,* These horses went to gather intel regarding the current political climate of the earth. 

##### The book of Zechariah presents Christ as: 

###### 1) *The Angel of the Lord*. Zechariah 1:11 

###### 2) *The man*.  Zechariah 1:10, 1:11, 13:7

###### 3) *The Branch*.  Zechariah 3:8, 6:12

###### 4) God's *Associate*.  Zechariah 13:7

###### 5) *The Shepherd*.  Zechariah 13:7

###### 6) *Priest*.  Zechariah 6:13

###### 7) *The King*.  Zechariah  9:9, 14:16

###### 8) The Redeemer. Zechariah 

###### 9) God's *Servant*.  Zechariah 3:8

###### 10) The *Stone*. Zechariah 3:7

###### 11) *Lord of the whole earth*. Zechariah 4:14, Revelation 11:4

###### 12) The Lord of Hosts.  Zechariah 14:16

#### 16. Zechariah 1:11c *and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.*" To the reader the initial thought might be, "Peace at last, All is well!". 

##### a. Though Persia experienced a lot of political instability after the death of Cyrus, at this time Darius had established a firm control over the empire and world dominance. The report of the horses at the time of their patrol was that all was peaceful and quiet.  

#### 17. Zechariah 1:12a *Then the angel of the LORD said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah*, The angel of the Lord is compelled to ask how long would the injustice to Israel continue. The question and answer are so that the reader might know how much longer things will remain like they are. 

##### We are reminded of Habakuk's cry to the Lord, "*How long, Lord, have I called for help, And You do not hear? I cry out to You, “Violence!” Yet You do not save*." These words were uttered before Judah was taken into exile. 

##### a. 70 years later, things with Israel were far from right in order to be at peace. The nations had taken advantage of Israel's demise. 

###### i) God had said their time of discipline was going to be 70 years. This is well over the 70 years and they still being oppressed. 

###### ii) The Gentile nations were at peace at the expense of God's nation Israel. God has no regard for man's way of peace apart from Him. 

###### iii) There is complete indifference on behalf of the nations towards Israel's sovereignty. nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to have their land. Even today, Israel is treated with contempt. 

##### c. True, world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne in Jerusalem. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4 

##### d. World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deaded her and Babylon is utterly destroyed. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5

##### c. God's timing regarding world judgement is perfect. He is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9 

#### 18. Zechariah 1:12b *with which You have been indignant these seventy years?"* This rider seems disposed for battle, especially after hearing the report from the patrol.

##### a. God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, "how much longer are your people to suffer?" Jeremiah 29:10. 

##### b. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 16 extra years had passed and still "*the earth is peaceful and quiet*" and no temple has been erected.  Jeremiah 29:10

##### c. The angel of the Lord's words reflect his compassion for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are "*at peace*".  It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Acts 1:7

#### 19. Zechariah 1:13 *The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words*. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the "questioning" and responds with kind words. Colossians 4:6

#### Psalm 94:19 *When my anxious thoughts multiply within me, Your consolations delight my soul.*

#### Isaias 35:4 *Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come with vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you.*"



#### 20. Zechariah 1:14a *So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying,* This message was not to be kept hidden, it was to be proclaimed to the people. 

##### a. As a prophet Zechariah's task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2 

###### i) This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12 

#### 21. Zechariah 1:14b *'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous...* The Lord kindly responds "*I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!*" God has a strong devotion towards his posession,  Israel.  Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7 

##### a. His disposition goes beyond what we hear when it is said, "God has a plan for you, he wants to bless you". We must realize that God is seeking jealously his posession unto himself to not share with anyone or anything else. God is willing to go to great lengths because of this, even to war against the nations because he desires a people unto himself. 

##### b. This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel. 

#### 22. Zechariah 1:14c *for Jerusalem and Zion*. Many times in Scripture we see Zion used synonimously with Jerusalem. Here Zion should be understood as even more specific. 

##### The earth is at the center of creation. Israel is the central nation of the world. Jerusalem is the central city in Israel. Zion is the mountain in Jerusalem where the temple will be built. Micah 3:12

##### a. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6 

##### b. The term, Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Micah 4:1

##### c. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Micah 4:2

#### 23. Zechariah 1:15a *"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease;* The nations were at ease with the current circumstances of Israel. 

##### a. The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not posess her land. They have done nothing to promote Israel's reestablishment. 

#### 24. Zechariah 1:15b *for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster."* 

##### a. Israel's exile a disaster because it was unnecessary.  Yet the response of the nations made the calamity even worse. 

###### i) The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent peace and requests to know how much longer the status quo would be permitted to go on.

##### b. The Lord had warned the nations (especially in the case the Chaldeans) they would be judged for the way they treated of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34-35, Amos 6:1 

#### 25. Zechariah 1:16a *'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion;* 

#### 26. Zechariah 1:16b *My house will be built in it...* the rebuilding of the temple is foretold here.  The fulfillment of the temple is near and far. 



### **Temples in the Bible**

|       | Temple                     | Timeframe                          |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1     | 1st - Solomon's            | 958b.C. - 586b.C.                  |
| **2** | **2nd - Zerubbabel's**     | **515b.C.-70a.D.**                 |
| 3     | Mount Gerizim (Samaritans) | 450b.C.-110b.C.                    |
| 4     | 3rd - Tribulation temple   | ? - after midpoint of tribulation? |
| **5** | **4th - The Branch's**     | **Millenium - New Jerusalem**      |

##### House or temple (BAYITH) appears 31 times in Zechariah. 

###### It can refer to a physical building. God's Temple (Zechariah 1:16, 3:7, 4:9, 7:3, 8:9, 11:13, 14:20, 14:21), Temple in Shinar (Zechariah 5:11), Dwelling of any person (Zechariah 6:10, 14:2).

###### The house of "*my friends*" (Zechariah 13:6, possibly 5:4) this could be referring to Israel including the false religious leaders. 

###### It can refer to a family or people. For instance, the house of Judah or the house of Israel (Zechariah 8:13, 8:15, 8:19, 10:3, 10:6, 12:4, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:12, 12:13, 13:1, )

###### It can refer to a religious system (Zechariah 7:3)

#### 27. Zechariah 1:16c *declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.*"' rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins. 

##### a. We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort and encourage the people. About 200 years earlier, God had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would send them into captivity if they did not heed his voice. 

##### b. Isaiah 44:28 *It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"* . 

###### i) Zechariah adds to Isaiah's prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zechariah 4:9-10 

#### 28. Zechariah 1:17a *"Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."'"*  Psalm 132:13

##### a. The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15 

##### b. While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah's time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.  

##### c. When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zechariah 13:9 

##### d. When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Ezekiel 36:11 

##### e. When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Ezekiel 36:23 

##### f. When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Ezekiel 36:36. 

##### g. When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Ezekiel 36:38. 

##### h. When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Ezekiel 37:6. 

##### j. When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Ezekiel 37:13 

##### k. When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Ezekiel 37:14 

##### l. When God's sanctuary will stand among them forever. Ezekiel 37:28 

##### m. When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Ezekiel 38:23 

##### n. When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Ezekiel 39:28 

## **B. Zechariah 1:18-21 Vision of Four Horns & Four Craftsmen**

#### 1. God's protection of Israel from oppressing nations.

#### 2. Zechariah 1:18 *Then I lifted up my eyes and **looked**, and behold,* there were four horns. Zechariah became suddently of four horns. 

##### a. Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. In verse 21 we see *nations* *lifted up their horns* against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17

#### 3. Zechariah 1:19a *So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?"* Zechariah did not readily understand what he saw. He asks the interpreting angel what they are. 

#### 4. Zechariah 1:19b *And he answered me,* "*These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.*" Zechariah saw four horns and the angel explains that these represented nations that had scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem. We are not told which nations are these referring to. 

##### a. Option 1 (past): The four horns had already come and gone. They are always stated as having come already. This could be referring to the four nations (Caldeans,  Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) that almost destroyed Judah during the time of Jehoiakim's reign.  2 Kings 24:1-2

###### i) The four craftsmen could be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah; 

###### ii) Assyria scattered Israel to the north, not Judah, Jeremiah 50:17-18

##### b. Option 2 (future): Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that oppress Israel. A few decades earlier, Daniel had prophecied of four horns. The first was Babylon, then Medo-Persia, Greece and finally Rome. This would align with the end "times of the Gentiles".  Ezekiel 34:11-31 

##### a. One difficulty is that Medo-Persia was instrumental in Judah returning to the land. 

##### b. The second option seems the most probable although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel's prophecy would probably associate these 4 horns with Daniel's. The identity of the nations however is not given.  

#### 5. Zechariah 1:20 *Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, "What are these coming to do?"* A craftsman is a skillful artisan. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31

#### 6. Zechariah 1:21b *And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head*; through oppression, sorrow, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15

##### a. This was their current condition but will be their ongoing condition as long as the "times of the Gentiles" continues. 

#### 7. Zechariah 1:21c *but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down* *the horns who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah* in order to scatter it."* Even though the horns had scattered Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would come to terrify them and throw them down. 

##### a. We don't know the identity of the four craftsmen. Some have said they are the very successors to the horns. For instance, the first crafsmen throwing down the first horn (Babylon) would be Medo-Persia. We cannot be certain of who these are. 

##### b. This vision served to encourage Zechariah's audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who has a plan and the resources to bring about justice in the end.

## **C. Zechariah 1:7 Vision of Measuring Jerusalem**

#### 1. Zechariah 2:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes and **looked**, and behold,* *there was* a man *with a measuring line in his hand.* No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a man who had an *instrument to measure in his hand.* 

#### 2. Zechariah 2:2a *So I said, "Where are you going?"* Zechariah was puzzled as to __<u>where</u>__ the man was going. He asks the man directly. The question of where may be because the current city of Jerusalem and it's borders were gone and was actually barren land since it had been demolished years before. 

#### 3. Zechariah 2:2b *And he said to me,* *"To measure Jerusalem,* *to see how wide it is* *and how long it is."* The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to measure Jerusalem. 

#### 4. Zechariah 2:3 *And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,* Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel. 

#### 5. Zechariah 2:4a *and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying,* the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting angel to *run*!  

##### a. Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement at the time! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.

#### 6. Zechariah 2:4b '*Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.* 

#### 7. Zechariah 2:5a *'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her,* God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for walls. 

##### a. Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy attacks. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3

##### b. Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it's even harder to see her not needing walls. 

#### 8. Zechariah 2:5b *and I will  be the glory in her midst.'"*  This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem but because of God in her midst. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11, 

#### 9. Zechariah 2:6 *"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,"* *declares the LORD,* *"for I have dispersed you* *as the four winds of the heavens,"* *declares the LORD.* 

##### a. This was directed to Zechariah's generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not inviting to a speedy return to the land. This was true then and continues today. 

#### 10. Zechariah 2:7 *"Ho, Zion! Escape,  you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."* Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.  

##### a. The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17 This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Revelation 17:5                   

#### 11. Zechariah 2:8  *For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.* God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10

#### 12. Zechariah 2:9a *"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves.* The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately *shatter them like earthenware* and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2

##### a. In a show of power, God will make these nations (them) to serve Israel (their slaves). One day Israel will be the greatest nation on earth. 

#### 13. Zechariah 2:9b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.* A most important aspect of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled. 

##### a. Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled "*...you will know that I am the Lord*" Exodus 6:7 

##### b. The phrase "*you will know*" occurs 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know because He would be there. 

###### i) *...that the **LORD** of hosts has sent Me*. Zechariah 2:9

###### ii) *...that the LORD of **hosts** has sent Me to you.* Zechariah 2:11

###### iii) *...that the LORD of hosts has sent **me** to you.* Zechariah 4:9

###### iv) *...that the LORD of hosts has sent me to **you**.* Zechariah 6:15

##### c. Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no doubt it is the fulfillment. 

#### 14. Zechariah 2:10a *"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion;* Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon. Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9 

#### 15. Zechariah 2:10b *for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.* 

#### 16. Zechariah 2:11a *"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.*

##### a. This is a reference to the **day of the Lord** when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel's rule. 

##### b. At least 20 references of the Day of the Lord are found in Zechariah. 17 of those times are in chapters 12-14. 

###### Zechariah 2:11  "*Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people...*

###### Zechariah 3:10  *...every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree...*

###### Zechariah 9:16  *...God will save them in that day As the flock of His people...*

###### Zechariah 12:3  *...I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples...*

###### Zechariah 12:4  *...I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah...*

###### Zechariah 12:6  *...I will make the clans of Judah...they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples...*

###### Zechariah 12:8  *...the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem...*

###### Zechariah 12:9  *...I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.*

###### Zechariah 12:11  *...there will be great mourning in Jerusalem...*

###### Zechariah 13:1  *...a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.*

###### Zechariah 13:2  *...I will cut off the names of the idols from the land...I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land...*

###### Zechariah 13:4  *...the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies...*

###### Zechariah 14:4  .*..His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives...*

###### Zechariah 14:6  *...there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.*

###### Zechariah 14:8  *...living waters will flow out of Jerusalem...*

###### Zechariah 14:9  *...the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.*

###### Zechariah 14:13  *...a great panic from the LORD will fall on them...*

###### Zechariah 14:20  *...there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD."...*

###### Zechariah 14:21  *...there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.*

###### vi) We conclude then that the Day of the Lord must then be referring to a future period of time when God begins working with Israel as a nation and ends with its ultimate restoration.    

#### 17. Zechariah 2:11b *Then I will dwell in your midst...*  God promises that He will once again dwell with Israel. 

##### a. This is what the tabernacle and temple symbolized. Exodus 25:8

#### 18. Zechariah 2:11c *and you will know  that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.* Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day dwell in their midst forever.  

##### a. In the person of Christ, God will literally dwell among His people. 

#### 19. Zechariah 2:12 *"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.*  Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God's people. They did not walk with God as a nation and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25 

#### 20. Zechariah 2:13 *"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."*  God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4 

## **D. Zechariah 3:1-10 Vision of Joshua the high priest and associates and God's associate, The Branch**

#### 1. Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matthew 23:35 

#### 2. Ultimately though, they will have their filthy clothes removed and given new. 

#### 3. Zechariah 3:1a *Then he **showed me** Joshua the high priest* 

#### 4. Zechariah 3:1b *standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.*

#### 5. Zechariah 3:2a *The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan!*   This must be Jesus rebuking Satan Indeed, 

#### 6. Zechariah 3:2b *the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!* Satan's accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem. 

#### 4. Zechariah 3:2c *Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"* 

#### 5. Zechariah 3:3a *Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments* This was Joshua's condition representing the priesthood and all of Israel. There was not need for Satan to try to find something, the situation was obvious. The stench of the soiled garments alone gives him away.

#### 6. Zechariah 3:3b-4a *and standing before the angel.  He spoke and said to those who were standing before him,* 

#### 7. Zechariah 3:4b *saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him."*  Joshua represents the current state of Israel.

#### 8. Zechariah 3:4c *Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes."*  What a delightful scene to see the filthy clothes taken and festal robes put on! 

##### Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on and exclaims... 

#### 9. Zechariah 3:5a *Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head."*  Perhaps an obvious next step to Zechariah as the priestly garments included a turban so he says, "don't forget the turban!!". 

#### 10. Zechariah 3:5b *So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.*

##### This is so essential to the message of grace then and now. 

###### It was God who **removed** unrighteousness.  

###### It was God who made the **sacrifice** for sin.

###### It was God who **clothed** us with His righteousness.

#### 11. Zechariah 3:6 *And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts,* 

#### 12. Zechariah 3:7 *'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,* 

#### having been cleansed, having had their sins taken away by the Lord, now Joshua is told to walk in God's ways and in His service. 

#### Unfortunately, we so often hear that cleansing only comes if we remove our sin or if we try hard enough not to sin. 

#### Here Joshua is being charged to walk with God in fellowship for ministerial service to take place. 

#### 13. Zechariah 3:7 *then you will also govern My house...*  The Lord of Hosts gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Ezekiel 44:15-16 

#### Interestingly, when Jesus will come, he will confront the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their failure to keep the first clause, "*if you will walk in my ways...*". Matthew 21:23-27 

#### 14. Zechariah 3:7 *and also have charge of My courts...* the courts must refer to that which took place in the event of quarrels. The religious leaders were to act as judges and deal with fairness and justice.  

#### 15. Zechariah 3:7 *and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here.*  The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest.   

#### a. Notice must given to the words of the angel of the Lord here..."*IF you will walk...then you will...*". The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. 

##### 1) governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways. 

##### 2) In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5 

#### 15. Zechariah 3:7 *'Now listen, Joshua the high priest,*  Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest. 

#### 16. Zechariah 3:7 *you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol,*   you and your friends - friends here symbolizes the priesthood. 

#### 17. Zechariah 3:7 *for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.*   God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13 

#### 18. Zechariah 3:7 *'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes.*   This addition is very interesting..."*before Joshua*" the stone. The cornerstone.  These may be the same seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.

#### 19. Zechariah 3:7 *Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.* 

#### 20. Zechariah 3:7 *'In that day,'  this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor* 

#### 21. Zechariah 3:10 *to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'"*   This is a picture of peace and blessing in the kingdom age due to their iniquity being absolved. 

##### Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakuk 3:17 

## **E. Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold**

#### 1. Zechariah 4:1 *Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep.*   The word then shows this vision came afterward. Since the vision was at night, the interpreting angel roused Zechariah so he was wide awake when receiving the vision. 

#### 2. Zechariah 4:2a *He said to me, "What do you **see**?" And I said, "I **see**, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks*...

#### 3. Zechariah 4:2b *and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;*   Exodus 25:37 

#### 4. Zechariah 4:3 *also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side."* 

#### 5. Zechariah 4:4 *Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?"* 

#### 6. Zechariah 4:5 *So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said,"No, my lord."* 

#### 7. Zechariah 4:6a *Then he said to me,*...particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained.

#### 8. Zechariah 4:6b *"This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,...*  this is a specific message to Zerubbabel.  who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12). 

##### a. His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge. 

###### 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what __<u>God</u>__ commanded. Ezra 5:2 

#### 9. Zechariah 4:6c *"This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,...'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts...*  

The Lord of Hosts tells governor Zerubbabel it's not by political power that the temple will be built but by The Holy Spirit. Zerubbabel will have to rely on God's strength not in the provision of the Medo-Persian government. 

##### a. The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they began rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14

#### This is a wonderful illustration to show God wants us to live as Christians. The teaching of God's grace is what instructs us how to really live; to trust, to depent on God for His strength (My Spirit) not our own (power).  Titus 2:11-12

##### b. All believers get their enabling strenghtening by grace (Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2) 

#### Grace teaches God's full provision for salvation from sin's penalty but also for the provision of daily living being delivered from sin's power. 

#### This is certainly contrary to those who say, "ease does not produce strength". God doesn't need strength, he desires trust. 

#### 10. Zechariah 4:7a *'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain;*   nothing is too great for the man who has the Lord of Hosts battling for him. A weak man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! 

#### 11. Zechariah 4:7b *and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"*   The top stone is the final capstone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? 

#### Not by man's might but by God's power! The shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba imply that the people will understand it is God's **doing**, not man's.  

##### a. God's power, God's Spirit glorifies God, not our strength (might, prowess, ability, wisdom) but the shouts of Grace, grace, demonstrates that a simple trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it! This is God using Zerubbabel's hands as instruments to bring glory to himself. 

#### 12. Zechariah 4:8-9a *Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house,  and his hands will finish it.*  Haggai 2:23

#### This is not Zerubbabel standing on the podium, receiving all the applause saying "glory to God".

#### 13. Zechariah 4:9b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.* 

#### This is the people rejoicing in response to and giving credence to God's provision.  

#### 14. Zechariah 4:10 *"For who has despised the day of small things?* 

##### a. The second temple wasn't quite as glorious as the first. The older generation that had seen Solomon's temple might want to be dissapointed. 

###### i) When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with raw materials.  He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world. 

#### 15. Zechariah 4:10 *But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—* a plumb line is used for building.  God would be pleased to see the reconstruction back in full swing. 

#### 16. Zechariah 4:10 *these are the eyes of the LORD  the seven eyes* Revelation 5:6 

#### Zechariah 4:10 *which range to and fro throughout the earth."*  

#### 17. Zechariah 4:10 *But these seven...will see and be glad...* Don’t despise things that appear small! What matters is how the Lord sees it! 

#### 17. Zechariah 4:11 *Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"* The lamp doesn't seem to draw Zechariah's attention like the olive trees on each side. 

#### 18. Zechariah 4:12a *And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,* 

#### 19. Zechariah 4:12b *which empty the golden oil from themselves?*" 

#### 20. Zechariah 4:13 *So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."* 

#### 21. Zechariah 4:14 *Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."*  The Olive trees serve to provide an unending stream of oil for the lamp to stay lit. 

#### This is a lamp that needs no human intervention like the lamp in the temple that constantly needed to be refilled with oil. 

#### Zechariah 4:14b *Lord of the whole earth...* Is clearly a reference to Christ. Revelation 11:4 

## **F. Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll**

#### 1. Zechariah 5:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes again and **looked**, and behold, there was a flying scroll. And he said to me,* 

#### 2. Zechariah 5:2 *"What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits."*  This could be the scroll that Christ opens in Revelation 5. Isaiah 30:8

##### The scroll happens to have the same dimensions as the holy place in the tabernacle and Solomon's porch. 

#### 3. Zechariah 5:3a *Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land;* Not earth but the land of Israel.

#### 4. Zechariah 5:3b *surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side,* Malachi 3:6-9

#### 5. Zechariah 5:3c *and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.* 

#### 6. Zechariah 5:4a *"I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts,* 

#### 7. Zechariah 5:4b *"and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name;* 

#### The religious leaders were responsible for the spiritual wellbeing. Psalm 78:70-72; Isaiah 44:28; 63:11; Jeremiah 23:1-4; 25:34-38

#### The house of the thief and theone who swears falsely in my name could be a reference to the temple. 

#### Matthew 21:13  *And He said to them, "It is written, 'MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER'; but you are making it a ROBBERS' DEN."* Matthew 23:38, John 10:1

#### 8. Zechariah 5:4c *and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones."*  Leviticus 14:45

## **G. Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket**

#### 1. Zechariah 5:5 *Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Lift up now your eyes and **see** what this is going forth."* 

#### 2. Zechariah 5:6a *I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth."* 

#### 3. Zechariah 5:6b-7 *Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah."*  It is possible that the lead cover symbolizes ministery of the Holy Spirit in restraining evil. 

#### 4. Zechariah 5:8 *Then he said, "This is Wickedness!"* The identity of the woman in the basket is given as the representation of wickedness.  

#### 5. Zechariah 5:8 *And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.* 

#### 6. Zechariah 5:9 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings;* 

#### 7. Zechariah 5:9 *and they had wings like the wings of a stork,* 

#### 8. Zechariah 5:9 *and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.* 

#### 9. Zechariah 5:10 *I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"*  The destination of the woman in the basket is asked. Wickedness is being removed from the land of Israel, but where? 

#### 10. Zechariah 5:11 *Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar;*  Wickedness will be carried away from the land of Israel to Shinar. 

##### Very early on, Shinar is seen as the crib of an organized, centralized commerce system and religion. 

###### Genesis 11:2, 4  *It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there..They said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."*

#### 11. Zechariah 5:11 *and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal."* Once the temple is prepared, wickedness will be set up as an object of worship. 

## **H. Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots**

### **1. Zechariah 6:1-3 The Vision**

#### a. Zechariah 6:1a *Now I lifted up my eyes again and **looked**, and behold, four chariots were coming forth*... Zechariah looks and he sees four chariots coming. 

##### 1) Chariots were used in battle. These chariots are going out in a war-like fashion to execute judgment. Psalm 46:9

##### 2) Chariots often symbolize power and authority. Psalm 20:7, Isaiah 66:15, Habakuk 3:8, Haggai 2:22

#### b. Zechariah 6:1b *from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.* The chariots came from between two mountains. 

##### 1) We are not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. There is no reason to think these mountains are not physical locations since the destination of the chariots are geographical locations, therefore the place of origin must be as well. Zechariah 6:8

##### 2) Which two mountains could these be referring to? We are not told. It may be that the place of origin of the chariots are mount zion and mount olives divided by the valley of Jehoshafat. Zechariah 14:4 

###### i) The bronze in Scripture is often where God’s judgement deals with sin. Numbers 21:9, John 3, Revelation 1:15

###### ii) The valley of Jehoshaphat is related in Scripture to the judgment of the nations. 

#### c. Zechariah 6:2-3 *With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.*..

#### d. earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three colours of horses. The meaning of the horse colors are not explained to us. 

###### i) red - symbolizes war and bloodshed

###### ii) Black - symbolizes death and famine

###### iii) White - symbolizes triumph and victory

###### iv) Strong dappled or grizzled - possibly plagues

##### There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does equate to identity. 

### **2. Zechariah 6:4-8 The Interpretation**

#### a. This vision clearly shows how the Lord almighty is in control over sovereigns. It regards divine judgment on Gentile nations rin relation to their poor treatment to Israel. Isaiah 66:15

#### b. Zechariah 6:4 *Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"* Zechariah wishes to know the identity of the horse pulled chariots. 

#### c. Zechariah 6:5 *The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,* The angel's answer refers to the question Zechariah makes. 

##### The word spirits (RUACH) can be translated *breath, wind, or spirit*

##### These are four spirits sent out before the Lord. Four spirits (winds) many times refers to divine judicial judgment. Jeremiah 49:8, Daniel 7:2, Revelation 7:1

#### d. Zechariah 6:6a *with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them,* One group of horses goes north. The other goes south.  

##### 1) Directions in Scripture are usually in relation to Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem is the center (naval) of the earth according to God. Ezekiel 38:12, Ezekiel 5:5

###### i) Jewish tradition teaches that the center of Israel is Jerusalem. The center of Jerusalem is the Temple which has the holy place as its center which contains the ark in its center and in the center of the ark. 

##### 2) West of Jerusalem is the Mediteranean sea. East is an impassable desert. Because of the geography of Israel, all of their attackers came from the north or south. 

##### 3) Therefore, the black horse goes north of Jerusalem. Typically invadors attacked Israel from the north or from the south. Babylon would have invaded Israel from the north. South of Israel is Egypt. Ezekiel 39:2

#### e. Zechariah 6:6b-7a *while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. "When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth."*  All the chariot teams seem eager to execute the command. 

#### f. Zechariah 6:7b *And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth.* 

##### 1) The reality is that God will execute judgment on all of Israel's enemies. 

#### g. Zechariah 6:8 *Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north..."* The Lord now responds to Zechariah. 

##### 1) It is probable that verse 6 and verse 8 refer to Babylon. If this is the case, this is merely a temporary appeasement of God's wrath against Babylon since Babylon will be reserved for judgment. Zechariah 5:5-11 

#### h. Zechariah 6:8 *have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.* - God's wrath was already appeased since Babylon had fallen to Cyrus. Daniel 5

#### i. The black horses followed by the white horses brought judgment upon the land of the north and appeased God's anger. 

##### 1) We conclude these must be angelic envoys sent by the Lord of all the earth. 

#### j. The message of this vision is clear. God will have vengeance on those nations who have mistreated Israel. 

## **I. Zechariah 6:9-15 The conclusion: a crown fit for The King**

### The following section is not a vision but wonderfully culminates the 8 visions and sets forth a clear message of the ultimate purpose in God's program. Perhaps this is the greatest section in Zechariah regarding the Messiah's work. 

#### 10. Zechariah 6:9-10a *The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, "Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah;*  Zechariah was instructed to receive an offering (not demand it) from these exiles. These exiles were gracious givers who wanted to contribute towards the temple building.  Ezra 1:4, 6

### While it is not Zechariah's job to receive offerings for the building project, God sends Zechariah to collect this special offering and will give it a singular purpose. 

#### 11. Zechariah 6:10b *and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.* God specifically tells Zechariah to go to a specific person's house and meet those men there. 

#### 12. Zechariah 6:11 *"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.* This calls the attention of the listener. Crown for a priest? This is strange, as you don't crown a priest. 

#### Crown - The Hebrew shows it should be plural. Revelation 19:12

#### Kings were to be from the tribe of Judah while priests could only be from the tribe of Levi. Gen 49:10, 

#### No king could be serve in the office of  priest and no priest could serve in the office as king. 

#### Saul - 1 Samuel 13 relates how king Saul tries to take on priestly duties to help. Though he was told he did it anyway and the consequence for doing it was that his kingdom was taken from him that very day. 

#### Uzziah - 2 Chronicles 26

#### Jeroboam - as king took on the prerogative to add two other places of worship, at Dan and Bethel. Two things come into play here. He got involved in the office as priest but primarily he played with the lineage of kings, specifically the line of David. 1 Kings 12:26-31, 1 Kings 14:9, 1 Kings 11:32, 1 Kings 11:28-29

#### Anybody that mixed the two offices of priest and king suffered terrible consequences. 

##### Joshua here serves as a type of a priest that will be crowned as king. To be warranted by God and the two offices joined in one person meant only one thing, this was referring to the Messiah. God's annointed priest-king. 

#### Christ is still a priest but is seated behind the veil on the Father's throne. Today, Christ is not reigning as king. He has not been crowned yet.  He will one day return to earth and will be crowned as king and function as priest and king in the Millenial age. Revelation 3:20 

#### 13. Zechariah 6:12a *"Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch,* The branch is a referrence to Messiah. Zechariah 3:8, Isaiah 11:1, Jeremiah 23:5, Jeremiah 33:15 

#### 14. Zechariah 6:12b *for He will branch out from where He is;* After the identity of this Man is established to be Messiah, we now are told what He will do.  

##### This speaks of Messiah's very humble beginning when He comes. Isaiah 53:2, John 19:5, 

#### Zechariah 6:12c *and He will build the temple of the LORD.* This speaks of Messiah's second coming to build the fourth temple which will be during the Millenium. Ezekiel 40-46

#### Ezekiel 8-11 The Shekinah glory departs from the first temple. 

#### Ezekiel 40-46 - The Shekinah glory returns to the fourth temple. 

#### Since the first temple was literal, we can assume the fourth temple will also be literal. 

#### The dimensions given for the fourth temple are literal and cannot be understood unless one takes it to be a physical temple with physical measurements. 

#### This temple will not be built until the Millenium and will only be erected during the Millenium since there is no physical temple in the Eternal State. Revelation 21:22

#### Prior to Jesus, the Jews always believed this verse was Messianic. 

#### 15. Zechariah 6:13a *"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor*...He will build the temple and he will bear the honor...While Zerubbabel was instrumental in building the second temple, he was did not receive honor, God did. 

#### The temple Jesus will build will be the millenial temple and He will receive all the honor for the building of it. 

#### 16. Zechariah 6:13b *and sit and rule on His throne.* He will build the temple and set up His throne in it. 

#### This speaks of two different roles. He sits and He rules. He sits as priest because of His finished redemptive work and rules as king from His throne. Revelation 3:20

#### 17. Zechariah 6:13c *Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."'*  The Priest will not only reign on a throne but His rule will be categorized by peace between the office of priest and office of king. The king will rule from His throne. This is the Davidic throne promised beforehand. 2 Samuel 7:12-16

#### Upon the merging of the two offices, Jesus will usher in world peace (shalom). 

##### He brings peace **with** God 

##### He bring peace **of** God in the heart

##### He brings physical, **world** peace 

#### 18. Zechariah 6:14 *"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.* The crown(s) serves as a reminder and that Zerubbabel's temple will be built. This will serve as a reminder for those generous exiles (that generation) who returned and took part building the second temple. 

#### However it also points to a greater fulfillment in the very Man who the crown is made for, the Priest-King, Messiah who will come and build the fourth temple and reign from it. 

#### 19. Zechariah 6:15a *"Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD."*  Jeremiah 31:10

#### Those who are far off is referring to the scattered people of Israel who will come to build the millenial temple. 

#### 20. Zechariah 6:15b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.* Acts 2:39

#### Complete obedience is referring to that which is only accessed to by faith in Jesus Christ and his finished (complete) obedience and payment for sin on the cross. This will take place when Israel as a nation recognizes Jesus Messiah. 

##### a. the fulfillment of the covenant promises will come to pass when they as a nation are right with God. Not merely practicing the rituals but with a right heart before God. This is what will take place when Israel puts their faith in Yahweh, specifically Jesus, Yahweh. 

# IV. Zechariah 7-8 - The **Third** Message: a poor theological understanding for what it means to "*return*"

## A.  Zechariah 7:1-14 Seeking the Lord's favour

### After the 8 visions, Zechariah now continues the theme of the book, returning to the Lord. Some 14 months have passed since Zechariah preached his first message from the Lord to return to Him. Haggai 2:12-16

### As it happens, the people decided to take up national fasts to remember the temple, the destruction of Jerusalem and other important events. This has been going on for 70 years now and the people of Bethel send a group of people to ask the priests if they should continue or not. 

### The people, especially the older generation, missed Solomon's temple, the glory days of Jerusalem and the way things used to me. Their trust was focused on returning to those "glory" days. Jeremiah 7:4

#### Their theological understanding of returning is about returning to when things were better. They were mistaken to focus on the historical blessings instead of the giver of the blessings. 

#### Their reason for seeking God was that His blessings would return, not because they were desirous to return to Him. 

#### The next two chapters deals with clarifying this misunderstanding. 

#### First, God will show them the error of their thinking. Then, He will show them where (or who) their faith should be placed on. 

### 2. Zechariah 7:1 *In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.* 14 months had passed between Zechariah's first last message and this third one. 

### 3. Zechariah 7:2 *Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,* 

#### Bethel means house of God, probably about 12 miles north of Jerusalem. At the time of the writing of Zechariah, Bethel was part of Judah, not Samaria. Ezra 2:28

#### we don't see Regemmelech mentioned any other place. However there is a Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father, the Assyrian king Sennacherib, and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38

##### a. Esarhaddon began to reign in place of his father, Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37

##### b. It is of some interest to note that Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, "*Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.*" Ezra 4:2

##### c. Were these two men Regemmelech and Sharezer  trying to merely "appease" God?

##### Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king's spokesman. If this is the same man, perhaps he had some governmental authority.  

##### d. Bethel has a history of idolatry. It was at Bethel that Jeconiah set up a calf to be worshipped so that the people would not go down to Jerusalem to worship. 

### 4. Zechariah 7:3 *speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain,*

### Zechariah 7:3 *as I have done these many years?*" This was something they had practiced over and over every year, every time the date come up. 

#### Perhaps they might have taken note of the prophet Jeremiah's conclusion as he lamented the destruction of Jerusalem. Though he was increadibly sad, his hope was in the Lord not on better days. Lamentations 5:21, 3:21-23

### The second temple was destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus the Roman. It was destroyed on exactly the same day, (the 9th day of the 5th month) as Nebuchadnezzar burned down the first temple in 586b.C. 

#### Today the Jews commemorate this day with fasting and morning. Instead of returning to the Lord, the religious Jews seek the temple to be returned soy they "return to God". 

### **Message #1** - Addressing a wrong concept of repentance

#### 5. Zechariah 7:4-5 ***Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,** "Say to all the people of the land and to the priests...'* Zechariah as priest and prophet receives the word of the Lord telling him communicate it to the people, including the priests. 

#### Zechariah 7:4-5 *When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years...* these fasts had been held for over 7 decades. 

##### a. The fast of the fifth month was remembering when Solomon's temple was burned by Nebuchadnezzar in 586b.C. 2 Kings 25:8

##### a. The fast of the seventh month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to flee to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25

##### b. Fasts were also held in the fourth and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2

##### c. These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They were self-imposed by the people and held throughout the years of Babylonian captivity. 

##### d. On the surface, the question being brought before the priests seems sincere. God's answer through Zechariah will reveal a problem. 

##### e. Perhaps many grew up practicing them and presumed they should just continue, not necessarily ever question why they got started in the first place. 

#### Their theological understanding of what repentance meant  needed to be challenged. They were more upset about the effects than the cause. To them, a return meant mourning over the evil that resulted in order to make the good return. 

#### Their concept of returning to God was an issue of how **they** were affected not what God said. The very reason they were taken out of the land was not a series of mishaps but because God had said their total disregard for Him would lead to their demise. 

#### Through this series of 4 messages, God will show them the crisis in their thinking in order to pleade with this generation of post-exile jews to change their thinking and return to Him by faith. 

### 5. Zechariah 7:5b *...was it actually for Me that you fasted?* perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting to commemorate the loss of the temple among others. 

#### In the minds of the people, especially the younger generation, it was a practice they had always done. They grew up doing it. It was normal to do it. Perhaps if the question had been, "**why** do you fast?", the answer would have been, "because we've always done so...". 

#### God goes beyond the initial why question and moves to a deeper level to make them question their level of sincerity, did you consider Me when doing it? Was it me you were after? Was I the intent of your heart? 

#### They were missing the point by asking if they should continue or not. They seem to have the presumption that what they did was right. Somehow they appear to have believed that their fasting caused their return to the land. 

#### So God makes them questions, **why** had they done it in the first place? Isaiah 58:3-8

#### motivation for these particular fastings were not for God. Neither did God ever tell them they should be **done**. 

#### Certainly the ritualistic weeping had an appearance of spirituality. Surely God would be impressed and be moved to show mercy? Isaiah 39:13

#### To ask if they should continue the fasts when the temple is rebuilt is a little like staring at a photograph of a person, trying to remember you, while the real person sits next to you. 

#### Today, Christians do things out of habit in the name of God, thinking they must be done because they have been practiced for decades. Perhaps we should ask ourselves why we do what we do. Is it really for a deeper fellowship with God that we do it? 

forgetting the reality behind the ritual is hanging on to an empty ritual. There is a mighty power in tradition to blind people from reality. Mark 7:13

#### One day in the future, all of Israel **will** weep, not for loosing out on some blessings or as a means to commemorate better days, but the day they realize it was them that had pierced their Deliverer and Messiah. Zechariah 12:10-14

##### 1) This is the day the nation of Israel will repent, they will change their minds and turn to God in faith to receive the forgiveness of sins through the finished work of Jesus the Messiah on the cross. Oh what a blessed day that will be! A glad reunion between a nation and their God. 

#### One of the greatest misunderstandings of the Bible today centers around the understanding of what repentance is.  In order to inspire what they consider to be repentance, many are teaching a Gospel of works. "Clean up your life and you will be saved", "have you truly mourned for your sin?", "turn from your sin and be saved". 

#### What was needed for Israel to be restored? To return to God. A simple turning from what they were trusting in (idolatry) to once again trust God. 

#### God is richly revealing His goodness, forbearance and long-suffering to lead people turn to Him. That is, to change their minds from what they are believing to believing in Him. Romans 2:4

#### Some teachings of "grace" essentially promote a sense of rebellion against the law of God. Grace is not contrary to the law, it is contrary to legalism. These false understandings end up promoting the believer with a license to sin. 

#### Legalism seeks to find God's favour either for justification or sanctification by means of law keeping. It is possible to see the Christian life as keeping with external morality, however God would question us, did you do it for Me? 

#### Grace teaches us Christ as the means to walk with God. Grace gives us the correct motivation of a thankful heart. 

#### In Christ the believer upholds and agrees with the law in, never rebelling against it. 

#### On the contrary, God is never in favour of legalism. Legalism springs from self-righteousness and a complete misunderstanding of God's perfect righteousness and man's depravity. 

#### The Christian is never encouraged to walk independent of God. Quite the opposite, God works all things together towards his/her utlimate good, for a life in total dependancy upon God. Isaiah 66:2, John 15:5, 19, Romans 8:32-33, Psalm 40:16-17

#### 6. Zechariah 7:6 *'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?* In a similar fashion to their fasting (ceasing from any food), eating and drinking is done without considering God but for mere physical supplement. We do it for self preservation. 

##### Whether we eat or don't eat makes little difference before God if our relationship with Him is estranged. 

#### 6. Zechariah 7:7 *'Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed  by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'*" 

#### God says through Zechariah, I"m saying now what I said through prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah and Amos spoke to the previous generation. This generation was on their way to repeating exactly same thing. The circumstances might be different but the message is exactly the same. 

#### The reason they were sent into exile in the first place, the reason the glorious days were over, was their own fault for not trusting the Lord. God had said through the prophets that it would happen if they did not listen. 

#### a. Amos 4:6  *"But I gave you also cleanness of teeth in all your cities And lack of bread in all your places, **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

#### b. Amos 4:7  *"Furthermore, I withheld the rain from you While there were still three months until harvest. Then I would send rain on one city And on another city I would not send rain; One part would be rained on, While the part not rained on would dry up.*

#### c. Amos 4:8  *"So two or three cities would stagger to another city to drink water, But would not be satisfied; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

#### d. Amos 4:9  *"I smote you with scorching wind and mildew; And the caterpillar was devouring Your many gardens and vineyards, fig trees and olive trees; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

#### e. Amos 4:10  *"I sent a plague among you after the manner of Egypt; I slew your young men by the sword along with your captured horses, And I made the stench of your camp rise up in your nostrils; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

#### f. Amos 4:11  *"I overthrew you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And you were like a firebrand snatched from a blaze; **Yet you have not returned to Me**," declares the LORD.*

#### This question demonstrates the way the people thought. They lamented over the consequences but had not learned why they lost it in the first place. 

It did not seem to enter their minds that they were actually estranged with God. This really didn't bother them. What bothered them is 'keeping a good testimony'. 

#### Their thinking dictated that if they would felt sorry enough, sad enough, if they truly lamented their condition, God would see them in their lamentable state and feel pity.

#### This is an example of a self-righteous approach and comes from a faulty understanding of God's absolute righteousness. The only way to approach God is God's way through God's provision. 

#### just like the fasting in those days was not for God, today's Christian activities can be godless while having a certain spiritual look appeal to them. Colossians 2:20-23

### **Message 2** -  Showing the cause; failure to walk by faith

### 7. Zechariah 7:8-9 ***Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,** "Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;*  God takes the nation back to a right perspective under the Mosaic law. They had willingly entered into this covenant with God. 

#### If Israel kept the law, God would bless them. However, when Israel did not follow their part of the covenant, God was obligated to curse them. 

The key thing to note is that failure to keep the Mosaic law was a given. God was not exiling them for failure to keep the law but rather for their failure to walk with Him in order to keep the law. 

Failure to listen means they were so intent on keeping the law they failed to be instructed on how God meant them to carry it out. The law was really meant to show them inadequacy so they would look to Him as they failed, as they learned and grew closer and closer to God as a result.  

#### This verse is not teaching in favour of modern day "social justice". The law was in place to protect the oppressed, not to force "equality" on everyone. 

#### God shows the people they failed. They were not dispensing fairness, brotherly kindness and compassion. Failure to keep their agreement should have been cause to seek to restore it with the other party - in this case God. 

Commandments 1-4 related to God, commandments 6-10 related to man. 

#### a. Zechariah 7:10a *and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor*; James, the epistle written to scattered Jews says, these are the marks of true religion. James 1:27

##### Empty rituals, morning lost benefits caused by ones own sin is just lamentable. 

#### They were not only neglecting but oppressing the most vulnerable in the nation. 

#### A stranger (GER) was a legal, non-jew living in the land. Ruth the Moabite, was an example of a stranger in the land. 

#### b. Zechariah 7:10b *and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.*' Their hearts were against one another therefore they devised evil. Proverbs 4:23

#### 8. Zechariah 7:11 "*But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.* This served as an instruction to this generation. Refusing to listen to God comes at inevitable consequences. 

##### Their indifference to God's word is what caused the 70 year exile. 

#### 9. Zechariah 7:12a "**They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts*

##### Flint is a very hard stone used for cutting and piercing things. A heart like flint is one that is hard, calloused and cannot hear God's word. 

#### Notice these people hardened their hearts and as a result they came to a point of being deaf. They were deaf because they chose not to not because God never gave them the ability to hear. 

#### This perhaps seems impossible but given time and a constant indifference to the conscience and to the hearing of God's voice, one becomes cold, indifferent and far. To the extent that one becomes deaf. Jeremiah 22:21

#### Zechariah 7:12a *had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets;* Acts 6:8-15

Zechariah is the first to record this doctrine of the Spirit. It was the Spirit that prompted the prophets to speak. 

#### They refused to listen to the prophets, they refused to see their failure to keep the law and need to turn to God in faith. Acts 7:51-53

#### When Stephen reminded the first century Jews about this and they stoned him. Acts 7:54-60

##### Matt

#### 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 *therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.* They did not keep the covenant, so in keeping with the agreement, the wrath of God came. Did they return to God when they realized this? Unfortunately no.  

###### For over 1000 the Scriptures were warning them of this. Deuteronomy 28:49-50

#### It is easy to misunderstand God's wrath is brought on due to His relationship being cut off with His people. It is a faith issue, not perfection issue. 

#### When God's people don't walk as they should, that is, trusting in Him, in His ways, listening to what He has to say, then God will turn to other methods to capture the attention of His people. 

#### 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 *"And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;* God reverses the situation. For countless times God has been calling to them, now they get to see what it's like when God doesn't listen. 

#### A relationship implies communication between each other. God had been speaking to the people but the people did not want to listen to Him. The communication was broken and the relationship suffered. 

#### While the people seemed to be fine without God, they ignored him. When troubles came however, they called out to God for help and in turn, God did not listen to them. 

#### Would they miss the point of God's not answering their call? 

#### Was God playing "the silent game" with them because He was being querulous? 

#### Did they call out to God because they realized they needed God or because they wanted to be freed of the situation? 

#### If God had helped them get what they desired, would it have helped the relationship? 

#### 11. Zechariah 7:14a "*but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known.* God's ways are perfect. He was wanted their ultimate good, since they were not in a condition to listen, He sent them into different directions where they were no longer together in the land. 

#### Since they wanted to be like the rest of the nations, God does exactly that. He scatters them to the nations. 1 Samuel 8:5

#### So much of Israel's custom revolved around the land, Jerusalem and the temple. These were given to them by God and could serve them as reminders of who He was. Yet now, in a strange land they had nothing except God. Would they turn to God to trust Him? 

#### Storm Wind Ezekiel 1:4

#### Zechariah 7:14b *Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.*" 

#### The land was made to rest. Rest from Israel's abuse to it but mostly, God removed them away from the land so by being alone in a strange land they might turn to God in faith. 

The point being made is clear. The reason they were exiled, the reason Jerusalem and the temple was destroyed was due to their incapacity to keep the covenant agreement, not because they had not kept a certain self-appointed fast. 

It's good that the priests had to be receiving this message too. They were a major part of the problem and their teaching needed to encourage a return to the Lord. 

In light of this, their question seems so very insignificant and it should encourage these men from Bethel and anyone else to repent, change their minds, return to the Lord. 

## **B. Zechariah 8:1-23 - 10 promises concerning Jerusalem**

1-8 future laid out

9 -13 - get busy rebuilding

14-15 - trust in God's promises

16-17 - go back to the mosaic covenant

### 1. **Message #3** - Promises 1-7

#### 1. **Promise #1**, The Lord will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem

##### a. Zechariah 8:1-2 ***Then the word of the LORD of hosts came**, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.*' Zechariah 1:14-16

##### Zion is used many times interechangeably with Jerusalem. 2 Samuel 5:7, Isaiah 40:9, Psalm 87:2-3

##### 

###### Zion can also refer to the people of Israel. Isaiah 60:14, Isaiah 52:1

###### Hebrews used Zion in a figurative sense to speak of the New Jerusalem. Hebrews 12:22

###### God is exceedingly jealous for Zion. 

###### It would appear in this context that Zion is used as the Holy Mountain. Zion here seems more specific than just Jerusalem, it is mount Zion where Jesus will reign and be worshipped.

Zechariah 1:14, Psalm 2:6, Psalm 132:13, Ezekiel 16

##### b. Zechariah 8:3a "*Thus says the LORD, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem.* Jerusalem is the only city that God says He will make his holy habitation. This will come about during the Millenial Kingdom. 

#### 2. Zechariah 8:3 Promise #2, Jerusalem will be called the city of truth

##### a. Zechariah 8:3b *Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,* 

##### b. Zechariah 8:3c *and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.*' The city of Jerusalem is not this way today. 

##### Revelation 11:8 - "*Sodom in Egypt*" during the tribulation. 

#### 3. Zechariah 8:4-6 Promise #3, Jerusalem will have complete peace and safety

##### a. Zechariah 8:4-5 "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.  'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.*' The elderly and the young (the most vulnerable people groups) will be safe and will not be afraid. 

##### Nebuchadnezzar burned Jerusalem to the ground leaving the young and the old lying on the ground. This is what this generation had seen. God says he will turn it around. Lamentations 2:21

Restoration from the exile:4. **Promise #4**, God will gather the Jews from the east and the west and bring them back to Jerusalem 

#### b. Zechariah 8:6 "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts.* 

When God announces restoration it may seem improbable but that is what is going to happen. Genesis 18:14

#### a. Zechariah 8:7-8a "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; *

Obviously east and west implies more than just Babylon. This is a worldwide return. 

#### *and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem;* Physical restoration. This sets the stage for discipline during the Tribulation. 2 Peter 3:10 

### 5. **Promise #5**, The Jews will once again be those who reflect God unto the peoples of the earth (they will be God's people). God will work with Israel once again. 

#### a. Zechariah 8:8b *and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.*' This is more than just a physical return, this is when Israel will return to the Lord! Isaiah 66:8, Zechariah 12:10

#### This sets the stage for the blessings of the Millenial Kingdom. 

#### Under the Mosaic covenant, Israel would be God's special people among the nations if they kept their part. That is, they would be a nation who reflected God and God would bless them before the Gentile nations. 

##### This is why while the Jews are in exile they are not God's nation. They do not reflect God as a nation nor do we see God blessing them in the land of promise. 

#### This in no way affects the Abrahamic covenant given 600 years prior that declared them as a nation to be God's posession. This was an unconditional covenant and promise God made to Abraham regarding his descendants. 

##### So even though the Jews are in exile, they are still his people and His promises to them still hold true. 

#### Exodus 19:5  *'Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, **then you shall be My own possession among all the peoples**, for all the earth is Mine;*

#### We can conclude by this verse that though Israel had not walked with God, there will be a time when Israel will be the people of God among the nations. This will come about because God will give them a new heart and the Spirit of God will dwell in them to empower them to walk as they should. 

#### b. Zechariah 8:9 "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong,* God was offering them the strength yet they were to let Him. 

#### Zechariah 8:9 *you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.* pay attention to the prophets who told you to get busy rebuilding the temple. Two of these were Zechariah and Haggai. Zechariah 2:12, Ezra 5:1, 6:14

##### a. Zechariah 8:10 '*For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.* There were political, economical problems. Haggai 1:3-6

They worked hard and yet had no wages. God had caused the political and economical problems. 

##### b. Zechariah 8:11 '*But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts.* 

God has changed his disposition. The current group would have a very different treatment if they returned to HIm.

### 6. **Promise #6**, The land will be a blessing and yield fruit

#### a. Zechariah 8:12a '*For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew;* Deuteronomy 28:1-14 Quoting by way of blessing if they went back tothe Mosaic covenant. Matthew 6:33

#### Israel had experienced times of cursing in the land, times of discipline away from the land. This speaks of a time of great blessing in the land. 

#### b. Zechariah 8:12b *and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.* 

#### Notice how God is actively making this to come about. Believing Israel "the remnant" will have as an inheritance off these things. Not by their doing or by their obedience but because God causes it to come to pass for those who believe in Him. 

In other words, God is saying that when they were focused on their homes, econbnomy, politics, etc God made it harder for them. HOwever, now as they focus on the temple, God would supply all their needs in abundance. Matthew 6:33

### 7. **Promise #7**, Israel will become a blessing to the nations

#### a. Zechariah 8:13 *'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing.*



#### *Do not fear; let your hands be strong.'* Do not fear, trust me! This reminder is listed 365 times in the Bible. How do you stop being afraid? Trust God's promises. Zechariah 8:14-15

Again he says, let you hand be strong. In other words, trust me, let me strengthen you! 

#### In just the same way that Israel has been a stigma among the Gentile nations, God will turn it around. He will reunite the houses (people) of Judah and Israel. They will be one nation under God. He will deliver them and they will no longer be a curse but a blessing to the other nations. 

#### God told them this so that they would take courage. They could find strength in this future promise. 

trust in promises 14-15

#### b. Zechariah 8:14-15 "*For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented,*. God purposed to bring harm against His people. Why? Because God relentlessly held them to the covenant they had entered into with God. God never quit upholding His part. 

God disciplines those He loves. He is relentless because he loves his people. Hebrews 12:5

#### *so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!* With that same relentless passion, God says he has purposed to do good to the city of Jerusalem and His people. Malachi 3:8-11, Jeremiah 29:11

#### Just like there were clauses regarding cursing in the covenant, there were clauses regarding obedience that resulted in blessings. Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 26

#### Once again, he reiterates, do not fear. God says, "when you trust me, you have nothing to fear!" Proverbs 28:1, 

#### In a similar sense, for the church age, we have nothing to fear when we trust God! 2 Timothy 1:7

Heart sins = Zechariah 8:16-17 - based on what has been previously discussed, God says, rather than focussing on morning, go back to keeping the covenant. 

##### a. Zechariah 8:16 '*These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment*

##### Because of who they were, because of their association with God as a people, the natural course of action should be to reflect God in their dealings with one another. 

They as a community should be truth tellers within the assembly of the believing. 

They were to be people of judgment. They should make judgments according to truth. Deuteronomy 13:1-5, 

We aren't to judge regarding people's motives. And we aren't to judge hypocritically. Matthew 7:1-6

##### *for peace in your gates.* They were to be people who promote peace. Primarily with each other. 

##### b. Zechariah 8:17 '*Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another,* Zechariah 7:10 

#### *Heart sins*: These are sins committed in the heart. 

#### beware! private thoughts will eventually lead to public actions. Proverbs 4:23 

#### 500 years before Jesus, Zechariah was instructing against heart sins. Matthew 5-7

##### Zechariah 8:17 *and do not love perjury;*" Loving to lie is something the Lord detests. False weights are an example of what this is talking about. Jeremiah 5:30-31

##### The treatment they had for eachother was reflective of who they had as God. Love for one another and being honest were two key points in the Mosaic covenant.  

#### Swearing by God's name and lying were probably strategies of business learned from their time in Babylon. They went from farming to commerce. They learned to take advantange of their neighbour (telling them untruths) and used God (using God's name in vain) to legitimize business. Matthew 5:33-37

#### These two sum up the two aspects of the law. 4 laws were regarding their relationship with God and 6 dealt with their interaction with fellow man. 

#### This did not reflect God's ways established for Israel. 

#### In regards to false prophets, though they are more at fault, it does not mean the people were innocent. The people wanted to hear things they liked. If the people would judge according to truth, false teaching would dry up. 

#### In a similar way today, there would be no business for false teachers if the people of God would judge according to truth.  

#### *for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD*. God is a God who loves, but He says there are things He hates. 

#### hauty eyes, lying tongue (perjury), hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run rapidly to evil, a false witness (perjury), one who spreads strife among the brothers (seek peace). 

#### Jesus also is quoted saying he hates the sin of the nicolaitans. This was something that a group of people were teaching. Possibly a teaching that promoted laity-clergy distinction. Revelation 2:6

### **Message #4** - Fasting will become joy, gladness and cheerful feasts

### 8. **Promise #8**, God will turn their mourning into gladness

#### a. Zechariah 8:18-19a ***Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,** "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months...*Four fasts were held every year conmemorating the byproduct of their sin. 

#### Religion thrives on ceremony. The greater the number of rituals, the higher the religion. 

#### Religion must of needs highlight the problem but only the God of the Bible provides full and complete restitution by grace. 

#### Zechariah 8:19b *...will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah;* The pharisees walked around with sad faces because that was the image of spirituality. 

#### True spirituality is God's complete provision in Christ. One response is characteristic to Him who experiences the spirituality that comes from Christ - turns mourning into joy, gladness and cheerful feasting! Psalm 30:11, 

#### Israel will one day experience this with God, when by faith they return to Him. Zephaniah 3:14-20

##### a. Zechariah 8:19b *so love truth and peace.*' Rather than focusing on mourning their losses, they should focus on loving truth and peace. 

##### The nations of the world seek peace. Yet it is at the cost of truth. Unless there is true justice, truth divides, therefore the nations of the world are willing to do away with truth to establish "world unity"  and  "peace"*. 

### 9. **Promise #9**, Gentiles will pour into Jerusalem to seek God's favor 

#### a. Zechariah 8:20 *Thus says the LORD of hosts,' It will yet be that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities.* 

#### This prophesies a crowd coming from cities will come.  Honor and popularity will be returned to Jerusalem as the capital. There will be unity among the people. Israel and Judah will be united as one nation. The cities speaks of the cities of Israel. 

Reason of exaltation

##### a. Zechariah 8:21 '*The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.*" We see the urgency of going, "let us go at once" to seek the favour of the Lord. 

This is how the conversation had began...they were seeking the favour of the Lord. 

#### The people don't go to see a statue or buy an idol but to seek the favor of the Lord and seek Him. 

Location of the exaltation

##### b. Zechariah 8:22 '*So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.'* The people of many nations come to Jerusalem. The fulfilment of this will be when Jesus is reigning in the city of Jerusalem. Zechariah 14:16-18

Why do people come to go to Jerusalem? Because that is where Jesus is. 

### 10. **Promise #10**, The Jew will be seen as a blessing to the Gentiles

Preeminence of city of Jerusalem

#### a. Zechariah 8:23 "*Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for **we have heard** that God is with you."*'" This is Israel being God's people and God being their God. 

#### In the kingdom, 10 gentiles will grab the garment of one jew to ask him to take them to Jerusalem to seek the Lord. 

#### The center of the world will be Jerusalem because Jesus will be there. Isaiah 49:22-23, Deuteronomy 28:13

#### God's blessing upon the jews will be undeniable. People of all nations will recognize the God of the Jews and seek to find favor with Him through the access available to the Jew. 

#### This was God's purpose with the nation of Israel from the beginning. They were to be a light unto the Gentiles. They were to be a vessel of pointing the way to God. 

#### Interestingly, after Satan is released from the abyss after 1000 years, he immediately attacks Jerusalem. Revelation 20:9

#### These future promises were to encourage the returnees in the present. 

#### The church also has many wonderful promises for the future which are to impress on us in the present. 

# V. Zechariah 9:1-14:21 - The **Fourth** Message: God's Way to "return" is offered yet rejected. The "return" is remembered, God's Way believed and the return is realized

## **B.** **Zechariah 9:1-11:17 The First Burden - The Kingdom of God is prepared and offered**

### A. The following 5 chapters were probably written at a later date of Zechariah's ministry. 

#### Many skeptics have tried to discredit the authenticity of chapers 9-14 saying it is not the same author as the first 8 chapters. However these arguments are untenable and can be refuted. 

##### Difference of style is not a conclusive argument for different authorship because style of writing can change with different circumstances. 

######  

#### Chapters 9-11 have to do with foretelling how God will come to Israel in the person of Jesus Christ and offering them to return to Him and set up His kingdom. They will reject Messiah and his offer.

#### Chapters 9 and 10 prophetically explain the time period when Israel was subjugated under Greece. 

#### Chapter 11 foretells when she is under Roman domination. 

#### Chapters 12-14 have to do with foretelling how God will not postpone the promised blessings due to Israel's return to the Lord. 

#### Like the prodigal son returned back to his father, we are told so too Israel as a nation will one day return wholeheartedly to their God through faith in Jesus Christ as Messiah. 

#### Matthew 4:17  *From that time Jesus began to preach and say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."*

#### Israel rejected this offer but out of that rejection God will create a new administration inclusive of the Gentiles. 

##### During this time, God will not work around one nation but through a new assembly, an organism composed of Jews and Gentiles known as The Church of Jesus Christ. Romans 9:25-29

##### God temporarily changed his focus from buidling a nation to building a spiritual gathering because of Israel's persistent unbelief. Romans 9:30-33

##### The Jews that believe during the timeframe of the Church are included in the Church. Sadly, by and large Jews continue rejecting to return to the Lord. 

###### 1 Peter 2:25  *For you were continually straying like sheep, but now **you have returned** to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.*

##### Though Israel as a nation rejected their Messiah, Like a loving father, God continues working circumstances throughout history towards Israel's future return. 

##### God is a God who is tied to keep his Word. 

> Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be!...For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will *their* acceptance be but life from the dead? Romans 11:12, 15  

#### Burden #1 contains three chapters. 

#### Chapter 9 - hymn

#### Chapter 10 - Messiah rejected

#### Chaper 11 - False shepherd 

#### Verses 1-8 judgment on oppresive nations surrounding Israel using Alexander the Great. Then comes Messiah unlike Alexander, he was a humble man. 

#### 300 years before Jesus came, God will use a Macedonian king named Alexander the Great to judge surrounding nations. The Greek language and culture became popularized throughout the world. This will set the scene for Messiah's arrival.

#### Zecharia 9:1-6 A Hymn of Divine Conquest and Protection

#### 1. Zechariah 9:1-8 Judgement of nations in the land, preparing the way for God's Messiah. 

##### a. After the battle of Issus in 333bC., Alexander the Great's conquered from north to south beginning at Syria, Phoenicia and then Philistia.

###### i) Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of **Syria**. 

###### ii) Tyrus and Sidon are principal cities of **Phoenicia**

###### iii) Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of **Philistia**.

#### 2. Zechariah 9:1a ***The burden of the word of the LORD***

#### Generally speaking, a burden is something God puts on somebody's heart. 1 Corinthians 9:16, Jeremiah 20:9

#### The word burden (MASSA) in conection to prophecy should be understood as a catastrophic judgment imposed on the prophet to be discharged with a sense of urgency. Zechariah 12:1, Malachi 1:1, Isaiah 13:1

#### Zechariah 9:1b *is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place... uncertain*. Hadrach (Chadrak) is a syrian deity. This city no longer exists but has been identified as existing between Hamath and Aleppo. 

##### a. Damascus means a well-watered land in Syriac. 

#### 4. Zechariah 9:1 *(for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD).* 

##### This verse could also be translated "*for the Lord has his eyes upon men and upon the tribes of Israel...*" Zechariah 1:8, 

##### a. The Lord sees all and takes into account everything and executes judgment and blessing accordingly. Zechariah 9:8, Proverbs 15:3

#### 5. Zechariah 9:2a *And Hamath also, which borders on it;* Amos 6:2, 2 Kings 25:18-21

#### 6. Zechariah 9:2b *Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.* Cities in the land of Lebanon. The king of Tyre serves as a type or an example of Satanic force behind a king. Ezekiel 28:12-17

#### Though Tyre and Sidon are wise, it will not save them. 

#### These cities were *wise* in their own eyes. Ezekiel 28:3-5, Proverbs 3:7

#### 7. Zechariah 9:3 *For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.* Their trust was in economic power. Their wealth was piled up. James 5:3

#### This fortress of wealth will not defend them. Her trust (build herself) is in piled up riches. 

#### 8. Zechariah 9:4 *Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.* Behold, the Lord enters into action. The Lord will use Alexander the Great to plunder Tyre. 

#### Tyre was an important commercial city with a great port that was thought to be impossible to conquer. 

#### The Assyrians laid siege against Tyre for five years but never conquered the city. 

#### Nebuchadnezzar tried to conquer Tyre for 13 years

#### Within 7 months, Alexander took the city and burned it to the ground.  

#### The nations saw this and feared. Ezekiel 27



Zechariah 9- - Philistia es dealt with

#### 9. Zechariah 9:5a *Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.* One of five main Philistine cities. Joshua 13:3, 1 Samuel 6:17

#### It was Ashkelon that historically caused God's people to be afraid. 

#### “*see it and be afraid*” in Hebrew is a play on words, *TERE* and *TIRA*.

#### 10. Zechariah 9:5b *Gaza too will writhe in great pain;* She inflicted pain on Israel, now she will suffer pain. 

#### 11. Zechariah 9:5c *Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded.* We are uncertain what her expectation was but God takes it away. 

#### 12. Zechariah 9:5d *Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza,*



#### Zechariah 9:5e *and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.*



#### Zechariah 9:6a *And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod,* God destroyed the cities and people and mixed them with a hybrid people. It may have been Alexander’s policy to mix the conquered peoples with each other.

#### 13. Zechariah 9:6b *And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.* Jeremiah 25:20, Amos 1:6-8, Zephaniah 2:4-7

1 Peter 5:5, Proverbs 16:18

Zechariah 9:7-

#### Zechariah 9:7 *And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth.* Philistine paganism involved drinking blood. It refers to idolatry. 

#### 14. Zechariah 9:7b *Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah,* This appears to be saying there will be a remnant of believers among the Philistines. Ezekiel 33:25

#### Zechariah 9:7c *And Ekron like a Jebusite*. When David conquered Jerusalem the Jebusites inhabited the city. David let them live and they were incorporated into Israel, Ekron will be same. 2 Samuel 24:16, 1 Chronicles 21:18

#### 15. Zechariah 9:8 *But I will camp around My house because of an army,* While God is judging the surrounding nations, He is also protecting Israel, Jerusalem and the temple. 

##### This is probably referring more to the protection of his people, Israel though all are ultimately included.

#### Zechariah 9:8 *My house* By this time the temple had been standing for about 200 years. 

#### Zechariah 9:8 *Because of him who passes by and returns;* This was fulfilled about 200 years later in 333b.C. when Alexander refrained from destroying Jerusalem. 

##### a. According to the historian Josephus, after Alexander took Gaza he made his way quickly to Jerusalem.  When the high-priest heard this he ordered that the people should cry out to God and ask for protection.[^1] 

##### At that time the high priest had a dream where he was told to take courage, adorn the city and open the gates and that the rest appear in white garments and that all the priests should wear their priestly garments.[^1]

#### According to the dream the priest acted entirely, and waited for Alexander. When Alexander saw them, everybody was in white and the high priest in purple, he approached by himself and fell before him. 

#### Later on, when asked why he had adored the priest, Alexander said, "I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit...and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind."[^1]

#### 16. Zechariah 9:8 *And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.* Zechariah 9:1, Jeremiah 16:17, Isaiah 60:18, Ezekiel 28:24 

Zechariah 9:9 - Description of Messiah

#### 17. Zechariah 9:9 *Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!*  This is perhaps the most known verse of Zechariah. It was fulfilled during Palm Sunday about 2000 years ago, 500 years after it was written. 

#### 18. Zechariah 9:9a *Behold, your king is coming to you;* 500 years prior, Zechariah announced the coming of their *melech Yisrael*! For Israel to have a king meant political sovereignty and deliverance from the oppression of vassal nations. 

##### Judah was overthrown by Babylon and taken into captivity. When they returned, they were subject to the whims of the Medo-Persians. Even though Zerubbabel was in the direct line of Davidic, he was not king. This confirms Coniah's curse. Luke 3:27, Matthew 1:12, Jeremiah 22:30

##### God wanted a king for Israel. He just had a certain kind of king in mind, not the kind Israel desired. 

###### The king the people wanted was ***like the other nations***. 1 Samuel 8:4-6

###### God wanted a king that was unlike pagan nations. A king that was just, righteous, faithful and good. Deuteronomy 17:14-20

#### 19. Zechariah 9:9b *He is just and endowed with salvation, a just king equipped with deliverance!*  Salvation is spiritual peace with God. Isaiah 45:21, 53:11, Jeremiah 23:5-6, Malachi 4:2

#### Why wasn't the kingdom established upon His first visitation? 

#### It was not because they did not enthrone the Messiah. No! John 6:15, Romans 9:33

#### In fact, He did not permit them to enthrone Him by force. 

#### In order for Him to reign as their Messiah King, they needed to return to the Lord first! Jeremiah 24:7, Malachi 3:7, 2 Chronicles 7:14

#### It is not the people of Israel who enthone the Messiah but God will do so over his enemies. Psalm 110:1

#### 20. Zechariah 9:9c *Humble, and mounted on a donkey,* Unlike Alexander, God in human flesh came to earth and chose to be born in a manger and rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. Luke 2:7

##### Why wouldn't Jesus make his triumphal entry into Jerusalem riding a horse like Alexander the Great? 

###### There are over 188 mentions of horses in the Bible. It may surprise you to know that Israel did not have horses. 

##### When the the decalog prohibits covetting, it does not mention horses yet it names oxen and donkeys. Surely horses are would be more desireable than donkeys...

###### Exodus 20:17  "*You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.*"

##### Archeological digs have found that all the nations in the area had horses but not Israel, that is, not until the time of Solomon in 970b.C. and that was out of disobedience. 1 Kings 10:26

##### The reason that Israel never had horses is expressly stated in the second giving of the law. 

##### Deuteronomy 17:15-16a  *you shall surely set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses...“But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses:*

#### God had told the Israelites not to have horses so that they would not become dependent once again on Egypt, since Egypt was the primary provider of horses at the time. 

##### The reason why they are not allowed to own horses goes back to something God had said when He delivered Israel from Egypt...

##### Deuteronomy 17:16b *forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, ‘Ye shall henceforth return **no more** that way.’”*

##### When God delivered Israel from Egypt, he wanted them to make a clean break and that they wouldn't have any reason to ever want to return. If Israel was not to return to Egypt, they must not trade with Egypt in any form.

##### Years later when King Solomon disobeyed and aquired horses that is exactly what ocurred...

##### 1Kings 10:28  *Also Solomon's import of horses was from **Egypt** and Kue, and the king's merchants procured them from Kue for a price.* 1 Kings 10:26-29

#### Knowing this fact that Israel was not to own horses, Psalm 20 verses 7 through 9 make a lot more sense. 

#### Psalm 20:7  *Some boast in chariots, and some in horses; But we will boast in the name of the LORD, our God.*

#### Psalm 20:8  *They have bowed down and fallen; But we have risen and stood upright.*

#### Psalm 20:9  *Save, O LORD; May the King answer us in the day we call.*

#### God did not want the people of Israel to conquer the land trusting in horses and chariots but in God. Zechariah 10:5

#### David conquered the land on foot. Therefore David's triumphs are really God conquering the land for them. Psalm 18:39-50

#### Proverbs 21:31, *“The horse is prepared for the day of battle: but deliverance is of the Lord.”*

#### Therefore, in humility, in keeping with the law and in trusting the Father, Jesus the king entered Jerusalem riding on what is possibly a fine-bread donkey. What a magnificent entrance in keeping with everything God is and does! 

Jesus made no exceptions when dealing with Himself in His first coming. He came under the law not to rebel against it but to fulfill it. 



#### All four gospels state this verse is fulfilled upon the triumphal entering into Jerusalem.  Matthew 21:1–11, Mark 11:1–11, Luke 19:28–44, John 12:12–19

#### Matthew 21:1  *And when they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,*
#### Matthew 21:2  *saying to them, "Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with her; untie them, and bring them to Me.*
#### Matthew 21:3  *"And if anyone says something to you, you shall say, 'The Lord has need of them,' and immediately he will send them."*
#### Matthew 21:4  *Now this took place that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,*
#### Matthew 21:5  *"SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION, 'BEHOLD YOUR KING IS COMING TO YOU, GENTLE, AND MOUNTED ON A DONKEY, EVEN ON A COLT, THE FOAL OF A BEAST OF BURDEN.'"*
#### Matthew 21:6  *And the disciples went and did just as Jesus had directed them,*
#### Matthew 21:7  *and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid on them their garments, on which He sat.*
#### Matthew 21:8  *And most of the multitude spread their garments in the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees, and spreading them in the road.*

#### Matthew 21:9  *And the multitudes going before Him, and those who followed after were crying out, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David; BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD; Hosanna in the highest!"*

##### While on the outskirts of town people followed Jesus crying, "*Hosanna to the Son of David...*", yet many in the city of Jerusalem had no idea who He was. 

##### Matthew 21:10  *And when He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "**Who is this**?"*. Matthew 21:1-10

##### Matthew 21:15  *But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done, and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David," **they became indignant,*** Clearly the religious leaders had no small part in keeping the people confused regarding the identity of the coming King.

The people wanted political peace. When the leaders of Israel realized that they had better chances of getting political peace with Rome then they yelled, "we have no king but Caesar". 

The people stumbled over Jesus. The kingdom of God is more than mere politics. Entrance to the Kingdom requires absolute righteousness. This was Jesus' offer to them. Matthew 5-7 

#### Zechariah 9:10 *Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.* This prophecy is not unique to Zechariah. It is aluded to back in Genesis 49. 

##### Genesis 49:10  *"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh comes, And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.*

##### Genesis 49:11  *"He ties his foal to the vine, And his donkey's colt to the choice vine; He washes his garments in wine, And his robes in the blood of grapes.*

#### reveals Christ's lowliness in outward condition as well as His inward disposition. The donkey is seen as the animal of peace. Genesis 49:11

Zechariah 9:10 - kingdom established upon the acceptance of their king

#### The people of Israel had suffered for hundreds of years under the oppresive hands of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Medo-Persians, under Greece and upon the Kings arrival, they were under Rome's oppresive rule. 

### B. Zechariah 9:10-10:12 The Messiah's offer...Since Israel rejected their Messiah on his first visit, these promises were postponed until the second coming. 

#### 1. Zechariah 9:10a *I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim...*  Ephraim here represents the land of the northern kingdom of Israel. Genesis 48:8-22

#### 2. Zechariah 9:10b *And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations;* Jesus will return as a conquered going out to war then bring in peace. Psalm 72:8

#### This may be what the Horseman on the red horse in chapter one is ready to go and do. Just like the patrol returned saying there was peace on the earth while Israel suffered, now, the Angel of the Lord, The Messiah himself will bring true lasting peace upon the earth. Zechariah 1:8-17

##### Isaiah 2:4  *And He will judge between the nations, And will render decisions for many peoples; And they will hammer their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, And never again will they learn war.*

##### The United Nations has tried to appropriate this verse taking on a Messianic role. Ironically, there have been more than 150 wars since the formation of the United Nations in 1945. This is far from bringing in peace. 

###### It was through a series of battles that Jacob had acquired posession of the land and it has been battle after battle for Israel ever since. 

###### This would bring great hope to a people who have experienced war since they arrived on the land. This will happen when God's King, the Messiah will reign, *He will speak peace to the nations*. 

Jesus will put down all warfare and strife. The chariot, the horse and the battle bow as representing weapons of warfare. he will remove all these and bring in world Shalom. 

#### Jesus came in humility, for a time He stooped down lower than the angels, became a man, offered himself as God's humble yet sufficient sacrificial provision for Israel's true return, His offer was peace, true peace, eternal peace with God. 

#### 3. Zechariah 9:10c *And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.* 

#### *Earth* is the word (ERETS) which could be translated land, however since the definite article is not in the Hebrew we understand it is not referring to the land of Israel but rather a world wide kingdom.  Psalm 72:8, Psalm 22:27-28

#### When Jesus comes to the earth, he will bring world peace in justice and truth. To be specific Jesus will reign from sea to sea. 

#### John says that in the eternal state there is no sea, this therefore must be speaking of a future reign after Zechariah's time and before the eternal state. 

#### We know this will be fulfilled during the 1000 Millenial Kingdom which is after the Tribulation and before the eternal state. Revelation 20:4-6

#### The entire time period between Zechariah 9:9 and 9:10 was previously unseen by Old Testament prophets. 

####  Today, thanks to Paul's teachings, we know it to be the church age. 1 Peter 1:10-11

#### This is why the Qumram arrived at the conclusion that there would be two Messiahs. Their names were Ben-Joseph and the second Messiah would be Ben-David. They believed there would be two different Messiahs. Why? Because they did not have Paul's writings explaining the mysetery of the church. 

#### Isaiah 9:6a  *For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;* This portion was fulfilled on the first coming, but the second part of the verse has over 2000 years in between. 

#### The second portion of the prophecy in this verse has yet to be fulfilled... 

#### Isaiah 9:6b  *And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.*

#### Isaiah 9:7  *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.* 

#### Today God is using the church to cause the Jews to be jealous of what they missed on Christ's first coming. Romans 11:11, 14

#### The church will spend 7 years in Heaven. However, then *they* (the church) *will reign upon the earth*...this is a literal 1000 year reign on the earth from Jerusalem. 

#### Revelation 5:10  *"And Thou hast made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign upon the earth."*

Verses 11-17 - The Maccabean victory -protection given from Antiochus IV

#### 4. Zechariah 9:11a *As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you,...* In order for a covenant to be firm, it had to be ratified in blood. Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 26:28, Psalm 105:7-11

Previously we saw a covenant to the peoples which dealt with God's holding the nations at bay so as to not allow them to completely anhilate the people of Israel. 

This covenant however is far greater in its scope and fulfillment. It is referring to a covenant God made to Abraham. Genesis 15:9-12, 18-20, 

#### This is a description of the wonderful things God will do for Israel because of his promise to her. Israel, like no other nation in the world has a covenant that God made with them.  Genesis 5:9-10

#### When a covenant was made, customarily, both parties passed between the the parts of cut up animals. While they walked through the parties would declare that the same should happen to them if they break their covenant. 

#### When God made a covenant to Abraham. It was a special ceremony because God did it with himself while Abraham slept. Therefore, the picture is that God made the unilateral covenant without any involvement or requirement on behalf of Israel, Abraham's descendants. 

#### God made many covenants throughout Scripture. They all kept a similar pattern. God promised he would make it. Then he ratified it. Then he clarified it. Then he fulfilled it. 

#### Ezekiel 36:22 end time regathering was undeservedly. God was being faithful to Himself. He always keeps his word. Specifically the promise he made to Abraham. 

#### 5. Zechariah 9:11b  *...I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.*.. Luke 16:24, restoration of those still in Babylon because of his covenant with them.

#### Cisterns without water were used as prisons. Genesis 37:24, Jeremiah 38:6

#### One cannot get out of a waterless pit unless someone rescues you.  Genesis 37:23-28

waterless pit - Joseph, jeremiah, daniel, Psalm 40

#### 6. Zechariah 9:12a *Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope;* 

#### God had made them rest the land. Every seven years the people were to trust God to provide while they rested the land. Since they did not trust the Lord, the kept farming the land even on the seventh year...they did this for 70 seventh years. Therefore the Lord took them out of the land, one year for every seventh year the land wasn't given rest. 

#### 2Ch 36:21 to fulfill the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept sabbath until seventy years were complete.

#### Leviticus 26:34 'Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, while you are in your enemies' land; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.

#### Leviticus 26:35 'All the days of *its* desolation it will observe the rest which it did not observe on your sabbaths, while you were living on it.

#### 7. Zechariah 9:12b *This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.* When God gets you out of the pit, he promises to make up double. Isaiah 61:7

#### Job was granted double after his trials. Job did not know what God was going to do. Job 42

##### Exodus 12:17  *'You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on **this very day** I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.*

Daniel 8:21-25, 11:23-35 

Zechariah 9:13-17 Macabean War  - feast of dedication/festival of lights. John 10:22-24

#### 8. Zechariah 9:13a *For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim.* This image of a bow and arrow refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together as God's bow and arrow in battle. 

#### 9. Zechariah 9:13b *And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece;* 

#### Times of the Gentiles: 

##### Babylon 605-539 b.C.

##### Medo-Persia - (Daniel 5) 539-331b.C.

##### Greece - Alexander 331-64b.C.

#### If Zechariah lived in the 500's bC. how could Zechariah have seen the Grecian era? Daniel 10:20

#### The reference of greece is no problem if you believe God knows the future. 

#### 10. Zechariah 9:13c-14a *And I will make you like a warrior's sword. Then the LORD will appear over them,* 

#### 11. Zechariah 9:14b *And His arrow will go forth like lightning; *

This is a type of How the Lord will come at the end of the tribulation. Matthew 24:27

#### *And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet,* This is not the rapture at the last trump. God has more than one trumpet sound. THis is for Israel. 

#### *And will march in the storm winds of the south.* 

storm winds of the south - God has been known to create the whirlwinds. Job 1:19

The Jewish people threw off the bonds of Antiochus iV for about 100 years. Zechariah 9:11 

#### 12. Zechariah 9:15a *The LORD of hosts will defend them.* God does not sleep nor slumber. The Lord of Hosts, is he who is ready to go to battle for them.  Psalm 27:10 

##### a. Zechariah 9:15a *And they will devour and trample on the sling stones;* no weapon formed against God will prosper. Isaiah 54:17

rather these peoples will become stones in the crown of the King. 

##### b. Zechariah 9:15a *And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine;* 
##### c. Zechariah 9:15a *And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,* 
##### d. Zechariah 9:15a *Drenched like the corners of the altar.* 

#### 13. Zechariah 9:16a *And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people;* Save here is not referring to salvation from the penalty of sin but rather it is saying that The Lord of Hosts will deliver them from their oppressors. 

#### That day here is not the Day of the Lord but this day, Hanukah serves as a type of the deliverance that will occur in the Tribulation. 

#### This is the day of victory when the Jews will miraculously overthrow the diabolical reign of Antiochus Epiphanes 167b.C.. 

##### Zechariah 9:16b *For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.* 

##### Zechariah 9:17a *For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! 

#### These are the covenant blessings that will come to Israel when she returns to the Lord. Deuteronomy 28:1-14

#### Israel will no longer be despised but will be an attractive nation. People will want what the Jews have. 

#### Zechariah 9:17b *Grain will make the young men flourish,* 

#### Zechariah 9:17c *and new wine the virgins.* 

#### Zechariah 10:1-12 The True Shepherd

##### Zechariah 10:1a *Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain* - droughts on the land came about because of their wrong relationship with the Lord. 

rain is simbolic of blessing or prosperity.

#### Spring is when they sow their seed. This is important to planting season. Joel 2:23

##### Zechariah 10:1b *The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man.* why ask God for rain? Because he is the one who makes the clouds to rain. Job 36:27-28

##### Why would there be no rain? Because God has devised that people still need to trust in the King for their daily provision. This is a means to impress upon the people to depend on God. Jeremiah 14:22, Joel 2:23-27

#### 17. Zechariah 10:2a *For the teraphim speak iniquity,*

####  The teraphim refers to many idols. They were household gods used for divination, probably shaped like human beings. Judges 17:4-5, 1 Samuel 19:13, 16

####  The idolatry in the land, the household idols came into their homes and people were looking to these idols for provision instead of God. 

#### Zechariah 10:2a *And the diviners see lying visions* Deuteronomy 18:14, Jeremiah 27:9, Jeremiah 29:8, Micah 3:7

#### Zechariah 10:2a *And tell false dreams;* Jeremiah 23:32

##### Zechariah 10:2b *They comfort in vain.* Job 21:34, Jeremiah 6:13-14, Jeremiah 37:19

##### Zechariah 10:2b *Therefore the people wander like sheep,* Though they provide an immediate feeling of comfort, it is in vain because it was not based on reality. Acts 19:19

##### Zechariah 10:2c *They are afflicted,* As long as these people were clinging to this idolatry, they were wandering like sheep. Zechariah 11:7, Numbers 27:17, Ezekiel 34:5, Jeremiah 50:6, 

#### Mattew 9:36 *Seeing the people, He felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.* Isaiah 61:1, Isaiah 49:13, Luke 19:10

#### Why consult God when I can get their palm read? It provided instant gratification. 

#### Why consult God when I have a god for that? A god for every want. 

#### The people were consulting demons or learning doctrines of demons and being 'guided' by this. They were wandering aimlessly. 

#### Saul lost his kingdom by consulting mediums. 

##### Zechariah 10:2c *because there is no shepherd.* Sheep don't do well without a shepherd.

#### Sheep aimlessly wander without a shepherd. A shepherd leads to water, leads to grass for food. A shepherd protects and keep the sheep safe. 

#### Just like sheep without a shepherd are sheep lying in wait to be preyed on, so too the nation of Israel was open season for tragedy. 

God's intent to 

##### Zechariah 10:3a *"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats;* Ezekiel 34:17

The male goats are the civil leaders, who are worthy of blame for what has occurred. 

#### Zechariah 10:3b *For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah,* 

As sheep become restless and wander, now the Lord of Hosts has come. He will comfort the flock. 

##### Zechariah 10:3c *And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.* 

A Description of the King

##### Zechariah 10:4a *"From them will come the cornerstone,* The leader who would stabalize the nation would come from the house of Judah. Judges 20:2, 1 Samuel 14:38, Isaiah 19:13, 1 Corinthians 3:11, Isaiah 28:16

##### Zechariah 10:4b *From them the tent peg,* messiah that would hold the kingdom in place. 

#### The tent peg refers to the large peg in an Oriental tent on which were hung many valuables.[^6]

It will be in Messiah that the people will rest their hope. Isaiah 22:23-24

##### Zechariah 10:4c *From them the bow of battle,* in battle he destroyes the enemies of the nation. 

He is the Man of war. Exodus 15:3

##### Zechariah 10:4d *From them every ruler, all of them together.* Psalm 45:4-5

##### Zechariah 10:5a *"They will be as mighty men,* 
##### Zechariah 10:5b *Treading down the enemy in the mire of the streets in battle;* 

##### Zechariah 10:5c *And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them;* This is in conjunction with Armageddon. 

First He makes them like adorned horses for battle, then he turns them into His bow and then makes them mighty men of battle. 

When Jesus comes he will be coming as a warrior. 

##### Zechariah 10:5d *And the riders on horses will be put to shame.* Notice how we see contrasted Judah with the Gentile nations. The Gentiles are those with the horses. 

#### Zechariah 10:6 *"I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back,* 

Judah is the southern kingdom. After solomon's idolatry, the united kingdom of Israel between the 10 tribes to the north called Israel and two tribes to the south called Judah. 1 Kings 11

This verse is stating the reunion the political union of the tribes of the north with the tribes of the south. 

Today, nobody knows where the 10 tribes are specifically. They appear to be spread out around the earth. Yet when this occurs, God will save them, he will get them from where they are and rescue them. 

And God will bring them all back into the the land. 

#### Zechariah 10:5d *Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them,* 

God demonstrates his compassion with Israel even after their many rejections of Him. 



#### Zechariah 10:5d *For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.* 

#### Zechariah 10:5d "*Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad* Though Assyria came and overtook and catthered the north, God will bring them back and make them mighty. Ephraim is Joseph's son. Genesis 49.

This would have been done when Jesus offered peace with God. Since it was rejected, it was postponed. 

#### Zechariah 10:5d *as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.* 



#### Zechariah 10:8 "*I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them;* Shepherds use a certain whsitle they do to call their sheep. This picture is what the Lord will do and the people of Israel will gather to Him. John 10:27-28

#### Zechariah 10:5d  *And they will be as numerous as they were before.* The land of Israel will be a time of prosperity before the division of the kingdom at the end of Solomon's reign. 

#### Zechariah 10:9 "*When I scatter them among the peoples, *

This is not Babylon alone since Assyria and Egypt are mentioned later. since it's referring to a plural number of people. 

#### *They will remember Me in far countries,* They will remember is a strong implication that Israel has returned to the Lord. 

ZEchariah's name is God remembers. 

#### *And they with their children will live and come back.*  Not the present generation but sometime in the future. Their return is to Israel (come back). This is a geographical return to Israel. 

#### Zechariah 10:10 "*I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria;* 

Egypt and Assyria.  Isaiah 11:11

#### Zechariah 10:10 *And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon* 

They will be brought to Gilead is east of the Jordan in the land of Israel. 

Lebanon is 



#### Zechariah 10:10 *Until no room can be found for them.*

#### Zechariah 10:11 *"And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea,* 

#### Zechariah 10:11 *So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up;* God will dry the Nile river up. 

#### Zechariah 10:11 *And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart.* Assyria will be humbled and brought down politically. Egypt's authority will be taken away. Genesis 12:3, 

#### Zechariah 10:12 *"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD.* Israel will once again walk by faith, strengthened in the Lord.

Zechariah 11:1-3 Judgment on Israel

#### Zechariah 11:1 *Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars.* Jeremiah 22:23



#### Zechariah 11:2a *Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed;* 



#### Zechariah 11:2b *Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down.* God will go after the strong point of the nation. Exodus 27:6

#### Zechariah 11:3a *There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined;* Jeremiah 25:34-38

God is upset with these leaders. Zechariah sees it 500 years earlier. 

#### Zechariah 11:3b *There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.* everything they took pride in will be destroyed.. 

reasons for wailing

4-7 doomed for slaughter

#### Zechariah 11:4 *Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter.* Similar to before, Zechariah will take up mimes to explain what is going to ocurr. 

Zechariah is standing in the place of the Shepherd. 

#### Zechariah 11:5a "*Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished,* buying the sheep to slay. 

The picture here is of Israel being delivered into the hand of their oppressors. Israel will be dispursed into the nations. 

####  Zechariah 11:5b *and each of those who sell them says,'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!'*

Israel is being taken to slaughter in the name of the Lord! Religious people are getting rich from this injustice. 

#### *And their own shepherds have no pity on them.* 

#### Zechariah 11:6a *"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD;* 

#### Zechariah 11:6b **"but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power."* A king is referenced here. A foreign entity they are being sold to. 

This happened with Assyria, Babylon, Greece and Rome in 70AD. 

WE have no king but Caesar. 

#### Zechariah 11:7a *So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock.* 



**C. Zechariah 11:7-14: The True Shepherd's offer is rejected**

#### Zechariah 11:7b *And I took for myself two staffs:* 

Two staffs. Eastern shepherds carried a rod to beat away beasts from the sheep and A crocked staff to retrieve sheep over cliff and from tangled places. 

#### Zechariah 11:7c *the one I called Favor* God had chosen Israel. Deuteronomy 7:7

#### Zechariah 11:7d *and the other I called Union;* God's desire was to take the divided nation and unite them. Ezekiel 37:15-28

#### Zechariah 11:7e *so I pastured the flock.* 

Psalm 23, 

#### Zechariah 11:8 *Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month...* 

#### "One writer has counted forty different interpretations of these words".[^4]

#### This verse is possibly the verse that has the most interpretations of any other verse in the Old Testament. 

#### The context of this passage is during Christ's first coming. The three shephers are removed within one month.  Zechariah 10:3, Matthew 21:42-46

#### "...These three shepherds are the Pharisees and Herodians, the Sadducees." Matthew 22:15-16, Matthew 22:23, Matthew 22:34-35[^2]

#### The context referrs to the first visitation of the Messiah and these three groups were religious leaders at that time. 

####  During His first coming, these three groups set aside their differences in order to get rid of Jesus Christ.  

#### In order to get the death penalty, they became allies with Rome. 

#### When Rome destroyed the temple in the 5th month 70a.D. this may have been a death blow for these groups for selling out to the Romans. 

#### According to the Mishnah, both temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av. This could hardly be seen as a coincidence.[^3]

#### Zechariah 11:8 *for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me*. They mutually disagreed


#### Zechariah 11:9 *Then I said, "I will not pasture you.* 

#### Zechariah 11:9 *What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh.*" 

#### Zechariah 11:10 *I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.* Not merely a covenant to a people Israel but to all the peoples. 

"God has made a covenant with the peoples of the earth relative to His own people Israel. He has placed them under restraint lest they work Israel harm or ill."[^5] Job 5:23, Ezekiel 34:25, Hosea 2:18

Romans 15:8-9

In the Old Testament the church is a mystery. However, the promise has not been broken, only postponed. And postponement is not abandonment with God. That is what Zechariah 14 shows.[^2]

#### Zechariah 11:11a *So it was broken on that day*, 



#### Zechariah 11:11b *and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me*...This refers to believing Israel.

#### Zechariah 11:11c *realized that it was the word of the LORD.* John 8:28

#### Zechariah 11:12a *I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give me my wages;* Matthew 26:15, Mark 14:10-11

#### Zechariah 11:12b *but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.* 

#### Zechariah 11:13a *Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter,* The Lord told Zechariah to literally throw the 30 shekels of silver to the potter within the temple. 

##### How could Zechariah do this? Evidently the temple was rebuilt by this time. Can you imagine this being his first sermon in the temple.

#### Zechariah 11:13b *that magnificent price at which I was valued by them.*" 

#### Zechariah 11:13c *So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.* This action that Zerubbabel does in the temple sybolizes what actually occured when Jesus was betrayed by Judas. 

#### This is the second temple (restored by Herod). This temple will be destroyed in 70a.D. by Titus on exactly the same day as Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the first temple in 586b.C. 

#### Zechariah 11:14 *Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.* 

## **D. Zechariah 11:15-17 The False Shepherd**

#### Zechariah 11:15 *"The LORD said to me, Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.* Zechariah is asked to impersonate a foolish shepherd to illustrate what the people will accept as a shepherd. 

#### Zechariah 11:16a *"For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing,* 

#### Zechariah 11:16b *seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing,* 

#### Zechariah 11:16c *but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.* 

#### Zechariah 11:17a "*Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock!* 

#### Zechariah 11:17b *A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind.*" 

## **E. Zechariah 12:1-14:21 The Second Burden - Messiah's Second Coming, Israel's return**

#### Zechariah 12:1 *The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel.* While the first burden was regarding the nations, this second burden is specific to Israel. 

#### Zechariah 12:1 *Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,* 

#### Zechariah 12:2 *"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around;* 

#### Zechariah 12:2 *and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.* 
#### Zechariah 12:3 *"It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured.* 

#### Zechariah 12:3 *And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.* 

#### Zechariah 12:4 *"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment* 
#### Zechariah 12:4 *and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah,* 

#### Zechariah 12:4 *while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.* 

#### Zechariah 12:5 *"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.'* 
#### Zechariah 12:6 *"In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot  among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves,* 

#### Zechariah 12:6 *so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples,* 

#### Zechariah 12:6 *while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.* 
#### Zechariah 12:7 *"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first,* 

#### Zechariah 12:7 *so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.* 

#### Zechariah 12:8 *"In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them* 
#### Zechariah 12:9 *in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God,* 
#### Zechariah 12:9 *like the angel of the LORD before them.* 

#### Zechariah 12:9 *"And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.* 

#### Zechariah 12:10 *"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication,* 
#### Zechariah 12:10 *so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced;* 
#### Zechariah 12:10 *and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son,* The loss of a son, an only son is among the greatest sorrows known to man. The Holy Spirit includes several instances of grieving parents over their only son. 

Luke 7:12-15 Widow from Nain



Jeremiah 6:26, Amos 8:10

#### Zechariah 12:10 *and they will weep bitterly over Him* 

#### Zechariah 12:11 *like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.*

#### Zechariah 12:11 *"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem,*

#### Zechariah 12:11 *like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.*

#### Zechariah 12:12 *"The land will mourn, every family by itself;* 

#### Zechariah 12:13 *the family of the house of David... Nathan...Levi...Shimeites by itself* 

#### Zechariah 12:13 *and their wives by themselves;* 

#### Zechariah 12:14 *all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.* 
#### Zechariah 13:1 *"In that day a fountain will be opened* 
#### Zechariah 13:7 *for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.* 

#### Zechariah 132:7 *"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts,* 
#### Zechariah 13:7 *"that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered;*

examples of practicing truth and justice

#### Zechariah 13:7 *"And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD';* 

#### Zechariah 13:7 *and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.* 

#### Zechariah 13:7 *"Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies,* 

#### Zechariah 13:7 *and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.'* 

#### Zechariah 13:7 *"And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.'* 

#### 1. Zechariah 13:7 *"Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts.* 



#### 2. Zechariah 13:7 *"Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones.* We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep. 

##### a. Mark 14:27-28  *And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, because it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.' "But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."* 

##### Jesus quotes Zechariah where the Lord of Hosts declares he will Strike the Shepherd, then He continues what was written to say He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah in with the Gospel accounts. 

##### b. Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound. 

##### c. Isaiah 53:4 *Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, **Smitten of God**, and afflicted.*

###### i) Jesus was *smitten of God*. The next verse goes on to explain why...

###### ii) Isaiah 53:5 *But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His **scourging** we are healed.* 

###### iii) The word *scourging* (singular) here is another word for blow or wound. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins. 

##### d. Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do this. He would *strike down the Shepherd*, *turn His hand against the little ones* and *raise the Shepherd back up*. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 

###### The Gospel was God's eternal plan for the redemption of man.

#### Zechariah 13:8 *"It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off and perish;* 

#### Zechariah 13:7 *But the third will be left in it. "And I will bring the third part through the fire,* 

#### Zechariah 13:9 *Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested.* 
#### Zechariah 13:9 *They will call on My name, And I will answer them;* 

#### Zechariah 13:9 *I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"* 

#### Zechariah 14:1 *Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.* 

#### Zechariah 14:2 *For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured,* 

#### Zechariah 14:2 *the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled,* 

#### Zechariah 14:2 *but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.* 

Second coming

#### Zechariah 14:3 *Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.* 
#### Zechariah 14:4 *In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east;* 2 Samuel 15:30, Acts 1:11-12, Matthew 24:3, 

#### Zechariah 14:4 *The last time God descended on a mountain in this way was in the giving of the law.* Exodus 19:18

#### Zechariah 14:4 *and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west* 
#### Zechariah 14:4 *by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.* 

#### Zechariah 14:5 *You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel;* 
#### Zechariah 14:5 *yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah.* 

#### Zechariah 14:5 *Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!* 
#### Zechariah 14:6 *In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.*

#### *For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD,* 

#### Zechariah 14:7 *neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.* 


#### Zechariah 14:8 *And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem,* 
#### Zechariah 14:8 *half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea;* 

#### Zechariah 14:8 *it will be in summer as well as in winter. that is, it will never dry up.* 

#### Zechariah 14:9 *And the LORD will be king over all the earth;* 

#### Zechariah 14:9 *in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.* 
#### Zechariah 14:10 *All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem;* 
#### Zechariah 14:7 *but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate* 

#### Zechariah 14:7 *as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses.* 

#### Zechariah 14:11 *People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.* 
#### Zechariah 14:12 *Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem;* 
#### Zechariah 14:12 *their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.* 
#### Zechariah 14:13 *It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them;* 

#### Zechariah 14:13 *and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.* 

#### Zechariah 14:14 *Judah also will fight at Jerusalem;* 
#### Zechariah 14:14 *and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.* 

#### Zechariah 14:15 *So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel,* 
#### Zechariah 14:15 *the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.* 

#### Zechariah 14:16 *Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem* 
#### Zechariah 14:16 *will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.* 
#### Zechariah 14:17 *And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem* 

#### Zechariah 14:17 *to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.* 

#### Zechariah 14:18 *If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.* 

#### Zechariah 14:19 *This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.* 

#### Zechariah 14:20 *In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD."* 
#### Zechariah 14:20 *And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar.*

#### Zechariah 14:21 *Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts;* 

#### Zechariah 14:21 *and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them.* 

#### Zechariah 14:21 *And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.* Genesis 9:25-27

[^1]: Antiquities 11.8.4-5 Now Alexander, when he had taken Gaza, made haste to go up to Jerusalem; and Jaddua the high-priest, when he heard that, was in agony, and under terror, as not knowing how he should meet the Macedonians, since the king was displeased at his foregoing disobedience. He therefore ordained that the people should make supplications, and should join with him in offering sacrifices to God, whom he besought to protect that nation, and to deliver them from the perils that were coming upon them; whereupon God warned him in a dream, which came upon him after he had offered sacrifice, that he should take courage, adorn the city, and open the gates; that the rest appear in white garments, but that he and the priests should meet the king in habits proper to their order, without the dread of any ill consequences, which the providence of God would prevent. Upon which, when he rose from his sleep, he greatly rejoiced; and declared to all the warning he had received from God. According to the dream he acted entirely, and so waited for the coming of the king.And when he understood that he was not far from the city, he went out in procession, with the priests and the multitude of the citizens. The procession was venerable, and the manner of it different from that of other nations. It reached to a place called Sapha; which name, translated in Greek, signifies a *prospect*, for you have thence a prospect both of Jerusalem and of the temple; and when the Phoenicians and the Chaldeans that followed him, thought they should have liberty to plunder the city, and torment the high-priest to death, which the king’s displeasure fairly promised them, the very reverse of it happened; for Alexander, when he saw the multitude at a distance, in white garments, while the priests stood clothed with fine linen, and the high-priest in purple and scarlet clothing, with his mitre on his head having the golden plate on which the name of God was engraved, he approached by himself, and adored that name, and first saluted the high-priest. The Jews also did all together, with one voice, salute Alexander, and encompass him about: whereupon the kings of Syria and the rest were surprised at what Alexander had done, and supposed him to be disordered in his mind. However, Parmenio [Alexander’s second-in-command] alone went up to him, and asked him how it came to pass, that when all others adored him, he should adore the high-priest of the Jews? To whom he replied, “I did not adore him, but that God who has honored him with that high-priesthood; for I saw this very person in a dream, in this very habit, when I was at Dios, in Macedonia, who, when I was considering with myself how I might obtain the dominion of Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but boldly to pass over the sea thither, for that he would conduct my army, and would give me dominion over the Persians; whence it is, that having seen no other in that habit, and now seeing this person in it, and remembering my vision and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I bring this army under divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will succeed according to what is in my own mind.” And when he had said this to Parmenio, and had given the high-priest his right hand, the priests ran along by him, and he came into the city; and when he went up into the temple, he offered sacrifice to God, according to the high-priest’s direction, and magnificently treated both the high-priest and the priests. And when the book of Daniel was showed him, wherein Daniel declared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire of the Persians, he supposed that himself was the person intended; and as he was then glad, he dismissed the multitude for the present, but the next day he called them to him, and bade them ask what favors they pleased of him: whereupon the high-priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of their forefathers, and might pay no tribute on the seventh year. He granted all they desired: and when they entreated him that he would permit the Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also, he willingly promised to do hereafter what they desired: and when he said to the multitude, that if any of them would enlist themselves in his army on this condition, that they should continue under the laws of their forefathers, and live according to them, he was willing to take them with him, many were ready to accompany him in his wars."
