# Zechariah - The restoration of Israel through the deliverance of Messiah

- A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows... — Psalm 68:5
- You, LORD, hear the desire of the afflicted; you encourage them, and you listen to their cry, defending the fatherless and the oppressed, so that mere earthly mortals will never again strike terror. — Psalm 10:17–18

God is a father to the fatherless, a defender of the widow. He encourages the afflicted and listens to their cry. 

The book of Zechariah contains a powerful message to the reader. One's view of God is profoundly impacted to understand who God is and what He does. 

God is supremely above evil; and this is the one resource and unfailing comfort of faith. Zechariah clearly lays out God's redemptive plan of the ages carried out through Messiah. No other book, other than Isaiah, contains the Messianic prophecies that are contained within the pages of Zechariah. 

Under the current circumstances it would appear as though God had forgotten Israel. The prophet Zechariah's message is to show them that God remembers and in His appointed time will return to them in blessing. This offer is always before Israel yet they reject Him over and over. Eventually Israel will be brought through a great Tribulation and only then will the the prophecies of Zechariah be fully accomplished. It will be when God remembers Israel at His appointed time and where the blessings will never fade away again. 

# I. Zechariah - Background 

## A. Historical setting

### 1. Zechariah (Yahweh remembers) is a beautiful reminder of who God is, who His plan will be carried out through and some details about the unfolding of that plan. The book of Zechariah is largely occupied with coming Messiah and His reign of righteousness.

### 2. Zechariah is a post-exilic book written between 520 b.C. and 490 b.C. 

#### a. The Jews have returned back in the land for about 18 years after being exiled for 70 years in Babylon. Medo-Persia has overthrown the Babylonians and under Cyrus the Persian the command is given for the Jews to be allowed to go back. 

#### b. Zerubbabel has been placed in charge as governor and is given some finances for the rebuilding of the temple. 

### 3. Upon first arriving, the Jews immediately set to build an altar to renew the sacrifices. Following that, they proceeded to lay the foundation of the temple. 

#### a. This caused a lot of interest on behalf of the Samaritans who wanted to help rebuild the temple. Their help was refused because though they feared God, they served other gods as well. Ezra 4:1-3, 2 Kings 17:33

#### b. When the Jews refused their help however, they proceeded to make all sorts of trouble, telling the persian king that they should be prohibited to rebuild. Ezra 4:4-24

#### c. Somehow, in the change of power, the command to go back and rebuild was lost and the current king, Darius I had to go back through years of records and verify if authorization had been given or not. Ezra 5, Ezra 6:1-12

### 4. After more than 16 years of waiting, king Darius I finds Cyrus's decree and granted the rebuilding to continue. Ezra 6:1-5 

### 5. Two months prior to the prophecy of Zechariah, God had told the Jews through the prophet Haggai to begin work again on the temple. The Jews are discouraged and have lost hope. 

### 6. The message of Zechariah is one that is intended to encourage Israel not only to return to the land and to rebuild the temple but more importantly, to a spiritual return to the Lord.  

## B. General Information

| Structure of the book |  |
|:-------|---|
|Zechariah 1:1-6 | Introduction|
|  Zechariah 1:7-6 | Eight **visions**|
| Zechariah 7-8 | Four **messages**|
| Zechariah 9-14 | Two **burdens**|
|Key Term: **The Messiah of Israel is Presented**||

## C. Why study the book of Zechariah? 

### 1. The book of Zechariah is written directly to the Jews who were returning from the 70 year exile in Babylon. 

#### a.  It is a message of encouragement, of hope and and restoration. 

#### b. It is because of the message of Zechariah and Haggai that the rebuilding of the temple will continue and 4 years later be completed. Ezra 6:14

### 2. We would do well to learn from this book. The New Testament __<b>quotes</b>__ or alludes to Zechariah at least 40 times.  

#### a. Not only does it unfold details of prophecy, it reveals behind-the-scenes spiritual warfare 

#### b. It shows how God is in control and never forgets his promises  

#### c. Most importantly, it reveals to us the person of Christ (Revelation 19:10). 

#### d. It reveals to us interactions between Christ and God the Father prior to his first coming. 

#### e. It shows us his nature during his first coming and finally his galant entry and conquest on his second return as conquering king. 

#### f. It is our belief that the prophecies contained in the book of Zechariah are not to present to us as such a chronological unfolding of the future but rather to present to us the very purpose of prophecy - the unfolding revelation of Christ himself and God's plan of restoration. 

#### g. Zechariah's immediate audience as well as the generations to follow, including the church age, would greatly benefit from knowing God is far from finished with Israel. He chose to make unconditional promises to Abraham and He will keep his word. Those promises of the land, seed and blessing will be fulfilled literally. Genesis 12:1-3,

### 3. Zechariah is a book that is seldom taught as it undoubtedly presents the interpreter with many challenges. 

#### a. While Zechariah presents many future events and gives details regarding those events, the key to understanding Zechariah is not to reveal future historical narrative. Instead all the seemingly isolated events serve to support the main thread which is really a Person, God's Messiah, Christ the Lord. 

# II. Zechariah 1:1-6 - Message #1 - Introduction, God's call to return 

## A. Zechariah 1:1-2 Date and Author 

### 1. Zechariah 1:1a *In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,…* Cyrus was the Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the **writing** of Zechariah in 520 B.C.. 

#### a. The dating is not according to a Jewish leader as other Old Testament books. The dates the writing of the book are in reference to a Gentile king because Daniel's "*times of the Gentiles*" is now underway. No Jewish king is reigning and Jerusalem is being **trampled** underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24

##### 1) Perhaps many in Israel believed Messiah would now come since the 70 years of Jeremiah's prophecy are complete and they are coming back to the **land**. 

##### 2) Cyrus is mistakenly called the Messiah by the people because he let them return. However, God was using Cyrus as king to return the people back to their land. Isaiah 45:1-5

### 2. Zechariah 1:1b *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,…* Zechariah was a **levite**, born in Babylon (Nehemiah 12:1, 16). Zechariah means Yahweh remembers. 

#### a. Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel and John the Baptizer, Zechariah is both priest (Nehemiah 12:16) and prophet. Ezra 5:1, 6:14

#### b. Zechariah is probably a young man.  Zechariah 2:4

##### 2) Haggai prophesied in September, October and December. However, Zechariah's first prophecy was in November. Zechariah's prophecy complemented the message given by an older prophet. 

#### c. Some scholars ascribe Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah. 

### 3. Zechariah 1:1c *the son of Berechiah,…* Berechiah was Zechariah's father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra. Not much else is known about Berechiah except that his name means Yahweh blesses. 

#### a. Curiously, Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called Zechariah *son of Berechiah* in  Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions a martyrd Zechariah but __<u>leaves</u>__ Berechiah's name out. Luke 11:51

##### 1) Option 1: A case of mixed identity. There was another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who had lived 300 years earlier that was killed by the people (2 Chronicles 24:20-22). Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. This theory claims since they mean the __<u>same</u>__, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus. 

##### 2) Option 2: Same ancestors. Both Zechariah's may have had fathers __<u>named</u>__ Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually somewhere in Zechariah's geneology. 

##### 3) Option 3: Copying error. An copyists's __<u>error</u>__ in transcription of the Greek text.

##### 4) Option 4: Only God witnessed it. Though no one else saw, Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah's __<u>murder</u>__, just the same as he did Abel's. This seems the most plausible option of the 4. 

###### i) The Jewish Targum (oral tradition) also states that a Zechariah, son of Iddo, a prophet and priest was killed in the sanctuary. The rabbis would have no reason to agree with the words of Jesus. 

###### ii) Matthew seems familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would seem it caught his attention to hear Jesus __<u>mention</u>__ it this way.  

###### iii) God is not indifferent or blind to the suffering of his people. He sees all that is done in public as well as in secret. Ultimately he will bring justice. Romans 12:19-20

### 4. Zechariah 1:1d *the son of Iddo…* Iddo is Zechariah's grandfather.  His name means the appointed time. 

#### a. Iddo was a priest. Iddo is __<u>listed</u>__ among those who returned from Babylon.  Nehemiah 12:1, 4

#### b. Zechariah is also referred to as the **son** of Iddo. This is common practice in the Old Testament to say his forefather or ancestor. Zechariah 1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14 

### 5. Together, the names of Zechariah, Berechia and Iddo say,  "*Yahweh remembers, Yahweh blesses at the appointed time*".  When the set time comes, God will fulfill all His promises and will be carried out in blessing. 

## B. Zechariah 1:2-3 Thesis of the book, "*return to Me and I will return to you*"
### 1. Zechariah 1:2 *"The LORD was very angry with your fathers.…*  the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chronicles 36

### 2. Zechariah 1:3a *"Therefore say to them,…*  (the people who have returned)

### 3. Zechariah 1:3b *Thus says the LORD of hosts*... Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts' __<u>word</u>__ to the people.  

#### a. this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua. 

#### b. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction or interpretation. It was God's __<u>word</u>__.  Hebrews 1:1, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, 1 Peter 1:20-21

### 4. **THE LORD OF HOSTS (Yahweh Saboath):** 

#### a. The *Lord of Hosts* is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. In order to properly understand the book of Zechariah we must get better acquainted with this name. 

#### b. THE LORD OF HOST IS **COMMANDER OF ARMIES**

##### 1) (Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of armies used 235 times in the Bible). 
###### i) Tza-va (צבא ) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the plural, referring to multiple armies of which include angelic beings. 

##### 2) Isaiah 13:4  *...The LORD of hosts is mustering the **army** for battle.* Zechariah 12:9, Zechariah 9:14-16, Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16, Exodus 15:3 

##### 3) 1 Kings 22:19  *...I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many.*

##### 4) Isaiah 19:16 *...they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts...Awake to punish all the **nations**...* Isaiah 1:24, 2:12, 5:7

##### 5) Nahum 2:13  "*Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will **burn** up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.*" Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matthew 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20

##### 6) Luke 2:13 *And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying...* Genesis 2:1, Nehemiah 9:6, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16, Matthew 26:53

##### 7. Isaiah 37:35-36 *'For I will defend this city to save it for My own sake and for My servant David's sake.'" Then the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when men arose early in the morning, behold, all of these were dead.*

#### c. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **KING**:

##### 1) Psalm 24:10 *Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah*. Zechariah 14:9, 1 Kings 22:19

##### 2) Isaiah 9:7 *There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this.*

##### 3) Isaiah 28:5  *In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people;* 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14

#### d. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **THE REDEEMER**:

##### 1) Isaiah 47:4 *Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel.*

##### 2) Isaiah 44:6 "*Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me.* Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5

##### 3) Psalm 84:1-12 ....*How blessed is the man who trusts in You!*

#### e. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **HOLY**:

##### 1) Isaiah 6:3 "*Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory.*" Jeremiah 32:18, Isaiah 8:14, Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16

#### f. THE LORD OF HOSTS IS **ALMIGHTY**:

##### 1) "All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN & among the inhabitants of earth & no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, 'What have You done?" Daniel 4:35

##### 2) Hannah is the first person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. 1 Samuel 1

##### 3) David invokes the Lord of Hosts when going before Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10

###### i) Though David didn't use  Saul's  armor, he put on the Lord of Hosts. 

###### ii) David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27  

> A Mighty Fortress is our God (Martin Luther)

>A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; 
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow'r are great, and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;
**Lord Sabaoth is his name**, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

>And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us;
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

>That word above all earthly pow'rs, no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth;
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.  

#### g. The powerful thrust of the book of Zechariah lies in understanding that it is the *Lord of Hosts* who is actively involved with the protection, provision and ultimate destiny of Israel. He is the Almighty, great Commander, the One who battles in favour of his people. 

##### 1) Zechariah's message comes directly from the Lord of hosts himself. This is __<u>crucial</u>__ to see to properly understand the message.

##### 2) It is the Lord of Hosts who will ultimately not allow injustice to His people. Zechariah 1:15, Amos 6:1, Revelation 18:7-8

##### 3) When Christ reigns on the earth on His throne, He will be called *Lord of Hosts*. Zechariah 14:16-17 

### 5. Zechariah 1:3c *"Return to Me,"…*  While Haggai is more focused on the return to the land and the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah's message is to encourage the people to return to a right relationship with God. 

#### a. The Jews needed to place their focus and trust in the giver and purpose of the temple, not the temple itself. 1 John 3:3

#### b. That is why in Zechariah, God will reveal the person of Messiah. The book of Zechariah will present Christ as: 

##### 1) the Angel (Messenger) of the Lord. Zechariah 1:11 

##### 2) the man.  Zechariah 13:7, 1:10 

##### 3) The Branch.  Zechariah 3:8, 6:12

##### 4) God's Associate.  Zechariah 13:7

##### 5) The Shepherd.  Zechariah 13:7

##### 6) Priest.  Zechariah 6:13

##### 7) The King.  Zechariah  9:9, 14:16

##### 8) The Redeemer. Zechariah 

##### 9) God's Servant.  Zechariah 3:8

##### 10) the Stone. Zechariah 

##### 11) Lord of the whole earth. Zechariah 4:14, Revelation 11:4

##### 12) The Lord of Hosts.  Zechariah 14:16

#### c. The opposite of return is to __<u>forsake</u>__. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and needed to walk with God in faith. The result would be God's returning to them as the Lord of hosts to defend and fight for His nation. 

### 6. Zechariah 1:3d *declares the LORD of hosts,…*  The Lord of hosts declares Israel to return, not merely to the land but to himself. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are back in the land, they have rebuilt the altar and laid the foundation for the temple. It's appears as though things are going well apart from the opposition from the Samaritans. 

#### a. Perhaps Zechariah's message should be rather, rebuild the temple no matter the obstacles, just get it done! Yet, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, they must first of all return to Him by faith. This, perhaps was totally overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances. 

#### b. So, when a little trial comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, simply trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11  

### 7. Zechariah 1:1 *"that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts...* What a wonderful proposal is made by the Lord of hosts. It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts on your side. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God's presence among the people. Haggai's prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. 

#### a. The Lord of hosts is inviting Israel to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart with himself.



## C. Zechariah 1:4-6 An Illustration showing the antithesis of returning to the Lord

### 1. In order to communicate as clearly as possible, the Lord will say to the Jews what it is not. 

### 2. Zechariah 1:4a *"Do not be like your fathers,…*  2 Chronicles 30:7, Ezra 9:7, Nehemiah 9:16, Psalm 78:8 

##### a. In other words God says, when I say "*return to me*" it is the opposite to what your fathers had done, don't be like that!. 

### 3. Zechariah 1:4b *to whom the former prophets proclaimed,…* namely; Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Micah, Habakkuk and Zephaniah. Jeremiah 26:5, Daniel 9:6, Zechariah 7:7, 2 Chronicles 36:21, Matthew 21:34, Mark 12:2, Luke 20:10 

### 3. Zechariah 1:4c *saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."'…*Jeremiah 4:4, Jeremiah 13:10  

### 5. Zechariah 1:4d *But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD.…* They weren't deaf or somehow unaware of God speaking time and time again through the prophets. They were rebellious and refused to listen. Jeremiah 44:16 

#### a. Evil ways and evil deeds are used to demonstrate or to give credence their heart was clearly in the wrong place.  A return to God is not merely about ceasing to do those evil __<u>things</u>__ but a return to fellowship. 

##### 1) A __<u>return</u>__ to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 

#### b. God once again invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious __<u>rote</u>__. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27,  Colossians 2:23 

#### c. God hates religious rote as a replacement for a __<u>relationship</u>__. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4

##### 1) It is counted as **violence** to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4

##### 2) In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the superstitious Athenians on Mars Hill. *So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects*. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23

#### d. This generation was in serious danger of committing the same thing as the previous generations had done. Due to the prolonged period of delayed reconstruction, the people became discouraged. The arrived at the conclusion that it was not time for the temple to be rebuilt. Haggai 1:2

##### 1) Once again, God disciplined them with a drought and still they did not change their minds. Haggai 2:17

### 6. Zechariah 1:5a *"Your fathers, where are they?…*  The **fathers** had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. Psalm 90:10

### 7. Zechariah 1:5b *And the prophets, do they live forever?…*  Some prophets were **killed** by the very people they prophecied to.

#### a. God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God's offer of  __<u>salvatión</u>__ is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jeremiah 26:5, 2 Corinthians 6:2

### 8. Zechariah 1:6a *"But did not My words and My statutes, whiJmch I commanded My servants the prophets,…*  

### 9. Zechariah 1:6b *overtake your fathers?…*  Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still sends more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God's commands are still the same, even today

### 10. Zechariah 1:6c *Then they repented and said,…*  the word for repent (SHUB) could be better translated here "returned" as it's referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. Compare the use of __<u>SHUB</u>__ in Zechariah 1:3 with Zechariah 1:6

### 11. Zechariah 1:6d *As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.…*  

#### a. 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers . This including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. Ezra 2:64–65, Ezra 2:70 

#### b. Though many returned physically, their focus was on the land and the temple and on the blessings, not on the giver of those blessings.  "*Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.*' Jeremiah 7:4, 8

### 12. A NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible has been used to translate many different words and it has caused a great deal of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel. 

#### a. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. 

##### 1) The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original Greek word metanoia (change your mind). 

#### b. We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. 

#### c. They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them.  This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. 

##### 1) That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for all sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be made right with God. 

##### 2) Israel needed approach God by faith. To merely admit sinning and accepting the consequences from God is not the same as approaching God by faith. One must trust in God's provision for sin. 

#### d. The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of __<u>thinking</u>__, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said.  Ezekiel 20:43 

##### 1) It's not merely recognizing the __<u>wrong</u>__ you have done. It's not a focus on the admission of guilt. Matthew 27:3-5

##### 2) It's not feeling __<u>sorrow</u>__ for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. 

##### 3) It is true that God's kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9

##### 4) It's not ceasing from __<u>sin</u>__, promising not to sin or changing one's life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase "repent of your sins" is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says "*repent **for** the forgiveness of sins*" which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.  

##### 5) It's not something you __<u>measure</u>__ to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance.  This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today.  The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic.  Luke 3:8-18, 

##### 6) Biblical repentance is changing one's __<u>mind</u>__  towards God, you change your thinking from what you are trusting in to trust God. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1

##### 7) For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God's offer made through the __<u>Gospel</u>__ (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5

##### 8) Or for a believer in error should __<u>repent</u>__ (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16

##### 9) The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him.  

##### 10) Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned *by rote,* Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed." Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are *done* in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?" You turn *things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"? 

##### 11) God wanted this Zechariah's generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith. 

##### 12) "*Return to me and I will return to you*" - God

##### 13) “*Draw near to God and He will draw near to you*”. James 4:8 NKJV

## III. Zechariah 1:1-6 - Message #2 - Eight Visions

### A. Zechariah received 8 visions in one night. These visions are not literal, they use symbols and types to explain future literal events. Some would be fulfilled partially within the near future but others have yet to be fulfilled. 

### B. These vision will serve to encourage the people of Zechariah's time to finish the temple. They also serve to give hope for future generations as they describe how God is compassionate and faithful towards Israel and his plans to make Israel the 

### C. We will try not to discifer every  detail or arrive at conclusions unwarranted by the Text. Each of these visions does not give every detail to satisfy our curiosity. Thankfully an explanation is given by an angel who explains the meaning to Zechariah so we can know what we need to know. 

#### 1. Each of the visions follow a similar pattern. 

##### a. What Zechariah saw

##### b. Zechariah asks what it means

##### c. Someone will respond Zechariah with the significance

| Vision | Meaning                            |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |

### **A. Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of the patrol of the earth**

#### 1. Zechariah 1:7a *On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month*, in the Bible there are no Hebrew names given for months.  The names we have were acquired from the Babylonians. 

##### a. Moses gave the law to the second generation on the "11th month". Deuteronomy 1:3

#### 2. Zechariah 1:7b *which is the month Shebat*, Shebat is the aquired Babylonian name for the eleventh month. 

##### a. This is the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel.  

#### 3. Zechariah 1:7c *in the second year of Darius*, this is Darius I who succeeded Cyrus's son to the throne. 

#### 4. Zechariah 1:7d *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah,the son of Iddo,* this is three months after receiving the first message. 

##### a. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight visions in one night.

##### b. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was later compiled together to form all of Zechariah's prophecies.

#### 5. Zechariah 1:7-8a ...*as follows: I saw at night,* This was not a dream. He was awake and literally saw the things he describes. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Numbers 12:6

#### 6. Zechariah 1:8b *and behold, a man was riding*...This man is one of the riders but appears to take a more prominent role. There were coloured horses behind him. 

#### 7. Zechariah 1:8c *on a red horse*, generally speaking red symbolizes blood as a result of war. This rider may ready for battle. Twice Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. Revelation 6:4, Revelation 19:19-21

##### a. Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in context of war. 

##### b. The color red could be in connection with blood and or war. 

##### c. In Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.

#### 8. Zechariah 1:8d *and he was standing among the myrtle trees*  It appears as though the man who was riding on the red horse is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is under the shade of myrtle trees. 

##### a. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther's Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 

##### c.  In the New Covenant promises to Israel, God will turn briars (result of the curse) into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isaiah 55:13, Isaiah 41:19

###### i) The prophet Nehemiah mentions myrtle branches during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths. 

#### 9. Zechariah 1:8e *which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.* Red, sorrel and white horses behind him

#### 10. Zechariah 1:9a Then I said, "My lord, what are these?" Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw. 

#### 11. Zechariah 1:9b *And the angel who was speaking with me said to me,"I will show you what these are."* It is not the receptor's task to guess what he saw. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Revelation 1:1

#### 12. Zechariah 1:10a *And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,* Twice we are told he is a man. He enters the conversation and explains the significance of the vision...

#### 13. Zechariah 1:10b *"These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.*" These are most likely angelic beings sent by the Lord. 

##### a. This angel patrol roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7 

##### b. We know from Job 1:6-7 that Satan also roams to and fro over the earth. 

#### 14. Zechariah 1:11a *So they answered the angel of the LORD* The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 57 times in the Bible and 6 times in Zechariah. The definite article the helps identify He is singular. What else can we see? 

##### a. This “*man among the myrtle trees*” appears to be the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13). Scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead (preincarnate Christ), who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth. 

##### b. The Angel of the Lord appeared to these and more: 

###### i) to comfort **Hagar**. Genesis 16:7–14 

###### ii) to stop **Abraham**. Genesis 18; 22:11–18 

###### iii) to wrestle with **Jacob**. Genesis 31:11, 13 

###### iv) to call **Moses**. Exodus 3 

###### v) to talk sense into **Balaam**. Numbers 22

###### vi) to prepare **Gideon** for battle. Judges 6:11–23 

###### vii) **Six** times in Zechariah. Zechariah 1:11-12, 3:1, 3:5-6, 12:8

##### c. The Angel of the Lord will one day destroy the nations to go against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:8


#### 15. Zechariah 1:11b *who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, "We have patrolled the earth,* 

#### 16. Zechariah 1:11c *and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet.*" To the reader the initial thought might be, "Peace! All is well!". 

##### a. Though Persia experienced political instability, by this time Darius had established a firm control over the empire and world dominance. The report of the horses was that all was peaceful and quiet.  

#### 17. Zechariah 1:12a *Then the angel of the LORD said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah*, The angel of the Lord is compelled to ask how long would the injustice to Israel continue. 

##### a. Things with Israel were far from right in order to be at peace. They had taken advantage of Israel's demise. 

###### i) God had said their time of discipline was going to be 70 years. This is well over the 70 years and they still are barely existing. 

###### ii) The Gentile nations were at peace at the expense of God's nation Israel. God has no regard for man's way of peace apart from Him. 

###### iii) There is complete indifference on behalf of the nations towards their own sovereignty. nothing is being done to allow Abrahams people to have their land.

##### c. True, world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from His throne in Israel. Isaiah 9:6-7, Isaiah 2:4 

##### d. World peace will not come until Israel has the land God deaded to her and Babylon is destroyed. Revelation 17-18, Zechariah 5

##### c. God's timing regarding world judgement is perfect. He is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9 

#### 18. Zechariah 1:12b *with which You have been indignant these seventy years?"*

##### a. God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, "how much longer are your people to suffer?" Jeremiah 29:10. 

##### b. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 16 extra years had passed and still "*the earth is peaceful and quiet*" and no temple has been erected.  Jeremiah 29:10

##### c. The angel of the Lord's words reflect his concern for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are "*at peace*".  It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Acts 1:7

#### 19. Zechariah 1:13 *The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words*. The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the "questioning" and responds with kind words. Colossians 4:6

#### 20. Zechariah 1:14a *So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying,* This message is not to be kept hidden, it is to be announced. 

##### a. As a prophet Zechariah's task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Hebrews 1:1-2 

###### i) This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zechariah 1:12 

#### 21. Zechariah 1:14b *'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous...* The Lord kindly responds "I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!" God has a strong devotion towards his posession,  Israel.  Isaiah 54:8, Hebrews 12:6-7 

##### a. This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel. 

#### 22. Zechariah 1:14c *for Jerusalem and Zion*. Many times in Scripture we see how Zion is synonimous with Jerusalem, yet here they are shown distinct. 

##### a. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psalm 2:6. Zion is the mountain on which God's house, the temple, stands. Micah 3:12. 

##### b. Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Micah 4:1, 3. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Micah 4:2

#### 23. Zechariah 1:15a *"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease;* The nations were at ease, that is, there was general peace. Persia was the world power and experienced a time of peace. 

##### a. The problem is not that the nations are at peace but that they are totally fine with the fact that Israel does not posess her land. They have done nothing to promote Israel's reestablishment. On the contrary, they are totally at ease with the current situation.  

#### 24. Zechariah 1:15b *for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster."* 

##### a. Israel's exile was unnecessary and a calamity but they response of the nations has only made it worse. 

###### i) The angel of the Lord steps up, despite the apparent peace and requests justice on behalf of Israel.

##### b. The Lord had warned the nations they (especially in the case the Chaldeans) would be punished  for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Genesis 12:3, Jeremiah 51:24, 34-35, Amos 6:1 

#### 25. Zechariah 1:16a *'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion;* 

#### 26. Zechariah 1:16b *My house will be built in it,"* the rebuilding of temple is foretold here. 

#### 27. Zechariah 1:16c *declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.*"' rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins. 

##### a. We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort. About 200 years earlier, God had said through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this if they did not heed his voice. 

##### b. Isaiah 44:28 *It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"* . 

###### i) Zechariah adds to Isaiah's prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zechariah 4:9-10 

#### 28. Zechariah 1:17a *"Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."'"*  Psalm 132:13

##### a. The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zechariah 6:15 

##### b. While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah's time, verse 17 is clearly yet future.  

##### c. 

##### d. When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zechariah 13:9 

##### e. When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Ezekiel 36:11 

##### f. When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Ezekiel 36:23 

##### g. When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Ezekiel 36:36. 

##### h. When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Ezekiel 36:38. 

##### i. When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Ezekiel 37:6. 

##### j. When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Ezekiel 37:13 

##### k. When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Ezekiel 37:14 

##### l. When God's sanctuary will stand among them forever. Ezekiel 37:28 

##### m. When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Ezekiel 38:23 

##### n. When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Ezekiel 39:28 

### **A. Zechariah 1:18-21 Vision of Four Horns & Four Craftsmen**

#### 1. God's protection of Israel from oppressing nations.

#### 2. Zechariah 1:18 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold,* there were four horns. Zechariah became suddently of four horns. 

##### a. Horns used in this way typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. In verse 21 we see *nations* *lifted up their horns* against Judah. Psalm 75:10, Daniel 7-8, Revelation 12-13, 17

#### 3. Zechariah 1:19a *So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?"* Zechariah did not readily understand what he saw. He asks the interpreting angel what they are. 

#### 4. Zechariah 1:19b *And he answered me,* "*These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.*" Zechariah saw four horns and the angel explains that these represented nations that had scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem. We are not told which nations are these referring to. 

##### a. Option 1 (past): The four horns had already come and gone. They are always stated as having come already. This could be referring to the four nations (Caldeans,  Syrians, Moabites and Amonites) that almost destroyed Judah during the time of Jehoiakim's reign.  2 Kings 24:1-2

###### i) The four craftsmen could be Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah; 

###### ii) Assyria scattered Israel to the north, not Judah, Jeremiah 50:17-18

##### b. Option 2 (future): Zechariah is shown a vision of the final outcome of the nations that oppress Israel. A few decades earlier, Daniel had prophecied of four horns. The first was Babylon, then Medo-Persia, Greece and finally Rome. This would align with the end "times of the Gentiles".  Ezekiel 34:11-31 

##### a. One difficulty is that Medo-Persia was instrumental in Judah returning to the land. 

##### b. The second option seems the most probable although we cannot be certain. Those who knew of Daniel's prophecy would probably associate these 4 horns with Daniel's. The identity of the nations however is not given.  

#### 5. Zechariah 1:20 *Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, "What are these coming to do?"* A craftsman is a skillful artisan. Isaiah 44:12, Isaiah 54:16, Ezekiel 21:31

#### 6. Zechariah 1:21b *And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head*; through oppression, sorrow, and misery they stooped and hung down their heads. Job 10:15

##### a. This was their current condition but will be their ongoing condition as long as the "times of the Gentiles" continues. 

#### 7. Zechariah 1:21c *but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down* *the horns who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah* in order to scatter it."* Even though the horns had scattered Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would come to terrify them and throw them down. 

##### a. We don't know the identity of the four craftsmen. Some have said they are the very successors to the horns. For instance, the first crafsmen throwing down the first horn (Babylon) would be Medo-Persia. We cannot be certain of who these are. 

##### b. This vision served to encourage Zechariah's audience that though things seemed hopeless in the present because of the many injustices done to them by the nations in power, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who has a plan and the resources to bring about justice in the end.

### **A. Zechariah 1:7 Vision of Measuring Jerusalem**

#### 1. Zechariah 2:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold,* *there was* a man *with a measuring line in his hand.* No sooner had the previous vision ended, Zechariah saw a man who had an *instrument to measure in his hand.* 

#### 2. Zechariah 2:2a *So I said, "Where are you going?"* Zechariah was puzzled as to __<u>where</u>__ the man was going. He asks the man directly. The question of where may be because the current city of Jerusalem and it's borders were gone and was actually barren land since it had been demolished years before. 

#### 3. Zechariah 2:2b *And he said to me,* *"To measure Jerusalem,* *to see how wide it is* *and how long it is."* The man responds Zechariah and states he is going to measure Jerusalem. 

#### 4. Zechariah 2:3 *And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,* Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel. 

#### 5. Zechariah 2:4a *and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying,* the second angel commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the interpreting angel to *run*!  

##### a. Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement at the time! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.

#### 6. Zechariah 2:4b '*Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.* 

#### 7. Zechariah 2:5a *'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her,* God himself will be the protecting wall around the city, there will be no need for walls. 

##### a. Walls were necessary around cities to provide protection against enemy attacks. The city of Jerusalem has been surrounded by walls since ancient times. Psalm 122:7, 2 Kings 14:13, Nehemiah 1:3

##### b. Perhaps it was hard to imagine Jerusalem full of people and commerce again, but it's even harder to see her not needing walls. 

#### 8. Zechariah 2:5b *and I will  be the glory in her midst.'"*  This is perhaps one key phrase of the whole book. One day Israel will finally be a light unto the Gentiles. Yet not Jerusalem but because of God in her midst. Isaiah 60:1-2, John 1:14, Revelation 21:11, 

#### 9. Zechariah 2:6 *"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north,"* *declares the LORD,* *"for I have dispersed you* *as the four winds of the heavens,"* *declares the LORD.* 

##### a. This was directed to Zechariah's generation. Though God had dispersed them He was not inviting to a speedy return to the land. This was true then and continues today. 

#### 10. Zechariah 2:7 *"Ho, Zion! Escape,  you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."* Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.  

##### a. The daughter of Babylon probably refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isaiah 47, Psalm 137:8, Revelation 17 This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Revelation 17:5                   

#### 11. Zechariah 2:8  *For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.* God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches his prized possession, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deuteronomy 32:9-10

#### 12. Zechariah 2:9a *"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves.* The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately *shatter them like earthenware* and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psalm 2

##### a. In a show of power, God will make these nations (them) to serve Israel (their slaves). One day Israel will be the greatest nation on earth. 

#### 13. Zechariah 2:9b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.* A most important aspect of prophecy is knowing when it is fulfilled. 

##### a. Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled "*...you will know that I am the Lord*" Exodus 6:7 

##### b. The phrase "*you will know*" occurs 4 times in Zechariah. At the fulfillment of the prophecies, they would know because He would be there. 

###### i) *...that the **LORD** of hosts has sent Me*. Zechariah 2:9

###### ii) *...that the LORD of **hosts** has sent Me to you.* Zechariah 2:11

###### iii) *...that the LORD of hosts has sent **me** to you.* Zechariah 4:9

###### iv) *...that the LORD of hosts has sent me to **you**.* Zechariah 6:15

##### c. Prophecy in Scripture is always fulfilled literally so when it happens, there is no doubt it is the fulfillment. 

#### 14. Zechariah 2:10a *"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion;* Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon. Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zechariah 9:9 

#### 15. Zechariah 2:10b *for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.* 

#### 16. Zechariah 2:11a *"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.*

##### a. A reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel's rule. 

##### b. At least 20 references of the Day of the Lord are found in Zechariah. 

###### i) When God returns and comforts Jerusalem. Zechariah 1:17

###### ii) When God defends the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:6 

###### iii) When God will destroy the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zechariah 12:3, 9  

###### iv) When God will remove all idolatry from the land. Zechariah 13:2 

###### v) reign over all the earth from Zion. Zechariah 14:4, 9

###### vi) This must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst.   

#### 17. Zechariah 2:11b *Then I will dwell in your midst...*  God promises that He will once again dwell with Israel. 

##### a. This is what the tabernacle and temple symbolized. Exodus 25:8

#### 18. Zechariah 2:11c *and you will know  that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.* Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ, will one day dwell in their midst forever.  

##### a. In the person of Christ, God will literally dwell among His people. 

#### 19. Zechariah 2:12 *"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.*  Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present time they were not seen as God's people. They did not walk with God as a nation and therefore did not reflect God to the nations. Romans 11:11-12, 25 

#### 20. Zechariah 2:13 *"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."*  God is angered at the current situation and the laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isaiah 62:1-4 

### **A. Zechariah 3:1-10 Vision of Joshua the high priest and associates and God's associate, The Branch**

#### 1. Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35 

#### 2. Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when "the Branch" rules 

#### 3. Zechariah 3:1a *Then he showed me Joshua the high priest* 

#### 4. Zechariah 3:1b *standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.*

#### 5. Zechariah 3:2a *The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan!   This must be Jesus rebuking Satan Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!* Satan's accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem. 

#### 4. Zechariah 3:2b *Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"* 

#### 5. Zechariah 3:3a *Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments* 

#### 6. Zechariah 3:3b-4a *and standing before the angel.  He spoke and said to those who were standing before him,* 

#### 7. Zechariah 3:4b *saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him."*  Joshua represents the current state of Israel.

#### 8. Zechariah 3:4c *Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes."*  This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's. 

#### 9. Zechariah 3:5a *Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head."*  Perhaps an obvious next step to Zechariah so he says, "don't forget the turban!!". Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on... 

#### 10. Zechariah 3:5b *So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by.*

#### 11. Zechariah 3:6 *And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, "Thus says the LORD of hosts,* 

#### 12. Zechariah 3:7 *'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,* 

#### 13. Zechariah 3:7 *then you will also govern My house...*  God gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Ezekiel 44:15-16 Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27 

#### 14. Zechariah 3:7 *and also have charge of My courts,*   The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests would be placed in charge of all the courts.  

#### 15. Zechariah 3:7 *and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here.*  The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest.   

#### a. Notice must given to the words of the angel of the Lord here..."*IF you will walk...then you will govern my house*". The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. 

##### 1) governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service. 

##### 2) In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 4:14-16, 1 Peter 2:5 

#### 15. Zechariah 3:7 *'Now listen, Joshua the high priest,*  Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest. 

#### 16. Zechariah 3:7 *you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol,*   you and your friends - friends symbolize all the priests 

#### 17. Zechariah 3:7 *for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.*   God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jeremiah 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13 

#### 18. Zechariah 3:7 *'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes.*   This addition is very interesting..."before Joshua" the stone. The cornerstone.  The seven eyes of the Lamb? Revelation 5:6 

#### 19. Zechariah 3:7 *Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.* 

#### 20. Zechariah 3:7 *'In that day,'  this is Messianic prophecy declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor* 

#### 21. Zechariah 3:10 *to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'"*   rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Habakuk 3:17 

### **A. Zechariah 4:1-14 A vision of a lampstand of gold**

#### 1. Zechariah 1:7 *Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep.*   Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to so he was wide awake when receiving the vision. 

#### 2. Zechariah 1:7 *He said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it,   a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks* 

#### 3. Zechariah 1:7 *and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;*   Exodus 25:37 

#### 4. Zechariah 1:7 *also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side."* 

#### 5. Zechariah 1:7 *Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?"* 

#### 6. Zechariah 1:7 *So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said,"No, my lord."* 

#### 7. Zechariah 1:7 *Then he said to me,*   particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained 

#### 8. Zechariah 1:7 *"This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying,  a specific message to Zerubbabel...*  who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12). 

##### a. His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge. 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what __<u>God</u>__ commanded. Ezra 5:2 

#### 9. Zechariah 1:7 *'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts.*  certainly contrary to those who say, "ease does not produce strength". Grace is what teaches us (Titus 2:11-12 ). 

##### a. The prophet Haggai tells us that God stirred up the spirit of the people and they began rebuilding the temple. Haggai 1:13-14

##### b. All believers get their enabling strenghtening by grace (Ephesians 6:10, 2 Timothy 2:2) 

#### 10. Zechariah 1:7 *'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain;*   nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable!  

#### 11. Zechariah 1:7 *and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"*   The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba. 

##### a. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!   

#### 12. Zechariah 1:7 *Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "The hands of Zerubbabel*

#### 13. Zechariah 1:7 *have laid the foundation of this house,  and his hands will finish it.*  Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God.  

#### 14. Zechariah 1:7 *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. "For who has despised the day of small things? 

##### a. The second temple wasn't quite as glorious as the first. The older generation that had seen Solomon's temple was a bit disappointed. 

###### i) When Solomon built the temple, he had 150,000 men with 3,000 superintendents no end of money. He also had other nations providing him with raw materials.  He was able to build a magnificent temple unto the Lord, which was one of the sites of the ancient world. 

#### 15. Zechariah 1:7 *But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—* a plumb line is used for building.  God would be pleased to see the reconstruction back in full swing. 

#### 16. Zechariah 1:7 *these are the eyes of the LORD  the seven eyes* Revelation 5:6 

#### Zechariah 1:7 *which range to and fro throughout the earth."*  

#### 17. *will see and be glad...* The Lord is saying, don’t despise things that appear small! What matters is that the Lord did it not the size or number of it! 

#### 17. Zechariah 1:7 *Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"* 

#### 18. Zechariah 1:7 *And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes,* 

#### 19. Zechariah 1:7 *which empty the golden *oil* from themselves?"* 

#### 20. Zechariah 1:7 *So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."* 

#### 21. Zechariah 1:7 *Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."*   Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Revelation 11:4 

### **A. Zechariah 5:1-4 A vision of a flying scroll**

#### 1. Zechariah 5:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, *there was* a flying scroll. And he said to me, * 

#### 2. Zechariah 5:2 *"What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits."*  the scroll that Christ opens in Revelation 5? 

#### 3. Zechariah 5:3a *Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land;* 

#### 4. Zechariah 5:3b *surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side,* 

#### 5. Zechariah 5:3c *and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.* 

#### 6. Zechariah 5:4a "I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts, 

#### 7. Zechariah 5:4b *"and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name;* 

#### 8. Zechariah 5:4c *and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones."* 

### **A. Zechariah 5:5-11 A vision of a woman in a basket**

#### 1. Zechariah 5:5 Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth." 

#### 2. Zechariah 5:6a I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth." 

#### 3. Zechariah 5:6b-7 Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah." 

#### 4. Zechariah 5:8 *Then he said, "This is Wickedness!"* 

#### 5. Zechariah 5:8 *And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.* 

#### 6. Zechariah 5:9 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings;* 

#### 7. Zechariah 5:9 and they had wings like the wings of a stork, 

#### 8. Zechariah 5:9 and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. 

#### 9. Zechariah 5:10 *I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"* 

#### 10. Zechariah 5:11 *Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar;*

#### 11. Zechariah 5:11 *and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal."* 

### **A. Zechariah 6:1-8 A vision of four chariots**

#### 1. Zechariah 6:1a *Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth*...earlier in the evening Zechariah saw a vision of three horses. Now he sees four groups of horses pulling chariots. 

##### a. Chariots were used in battle. Most likely that is the symbolism here. These chariots are going for judgment. 

#### 2. Zechariah 6:1b *from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.* We're not told if the mountains were made of bronze or if they were of that color. We're not told if they have any significance, just that there are two bronze mountains. 

#### 3. Zechariah 6:2-3 *With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.* 

##### Again, the symbolism of the colors is not explained to us. There are similarities with these horses and the horses in Revelation but similarity does not mean identity. 

#### 4. Zechariah 6:4 *Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"* Zechariah wishes to know the identity of the horse pulled chariots. 

#### 5. Zechariah 6:5 *The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,* we conclude these must be angelic envoys sent by the Lord of all the earth. 

#### 6. Zechariah 6:6a *with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them,* 

#### 7. Zechariah 6:6b-7a *while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. "When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth."*  Interestingly all the chariot teams seem eager. These seem to want to go patrol the earth. 

#### 8. Zechariah 6:7b *And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. God grants them permission to go patrol the earth. 

#### 9. Zechariah 6:8 *Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north."* The black horses followed by the white horses brought judgment upon the land of the north and appeased God's anger. 

#### 10. We are not told here the identity or timeframe of these events. Some speculate that the land of the north refers to Babylon which was overthrown by the Cyrus, God's anointed instrument. 

### **A. Zechariah 6:9-15 A message of hope, a crown for a coming King**

#### 10. Zechariah 6:9-10a *The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, "Take *an offering* from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah;* 

#### 11. Zechariah 6:10b *and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.* 

#### 12. Zechariah 6:11 *"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.* 

#### 13. Zechariah 6:12a *"Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch,* 

#### 14. Zechariah 6:12b *for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD.* 

#### 15. Zechariah 6:13a *"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor* 

#### 16. Zechariah 6:13b *and sit and rule on His throne.* 

#### 17. Zechariah 6:13c *Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."'* 

#### 18. Zechariah 6:14 *"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.* 

#### 19. Zechariah 6:15a *"Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD."* 

#### 20. Zechariah 6:15b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.* 

##### a. the fulfillment of the covenant promises are not whether they will happen or not. they will happen, however for it to happen they as a nation need to be in a right place with God. Not merely practicing the rituals but with a right heart before God. This is what will take place when Israel puts their faith in Yahweh, specifically Jesus, Yahweh. 

## IV. Zechariah 7-8 - Message #3 A brief look at the condition of the people contrasted by promises of the future

The next section of Zechariah comes 14 months later. The approximate date is December 4, 518b.C. This time Zechariah does not receive visions but rather in the form of a message from the Lord.  rest of the book of Zechariah comes in the form of messages that Zechariah received. 

### A.  Zechariah 7:1-14 The town of Bethel sends a delegation to Jerusalem to seek the favour of the Lord

#### 1. Due to time that has passed, probably in response to Zechariah's call to return to the Lord. An inquiry is made to the priests regarding current and past practices. These chapters should be treated as a whole within the message of Zechariah. Haggai 2:12-16

#### 2. Zechariah 7:1 *In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev.* 

#### 3. Zechariah 7:2 *Now the town of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD,* we don't see Regemmelech mentioned any other place. However there is a Sharezer who together with Adrammelech killed their father Sennacherib and fled to Ararat. Isaiah 37:38

##### a. Esarhaddon his son, began to reign in place of Sennacherib. 2 Kings 19:36-37

##### b. It is of some interest to note that Zerubbabel was offered help to rebuild the temple by Samaritans who stated, "*Let us build with you, for we, like you, seek your God; and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.*" Ezra 4:2, 

##### c. Were these two men Regemmelech and Sharezer  (Assyrian names?) trying to merely "appease" God?

##### Historical records show that a man named Regemmelech is a title of the king's spokesman. Perhaps this man had some governmental authority.  

##### d. Bethel has an interesting history of idolatry. 

#### 4. Zechariah 7:3 *speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?*" Since the destruction of the temple, people had started a fast as a lament of its loss. 

##### a. The fast of the fifth month was remembering when the temple was burned. 2 Kings 25:8

#### 5. Zechariah 7:4-5 *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, "Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years...*

##### a. the fast of the seventh month was commemorating the slaying of the Babylonian appointed governor, Gedaliah. Because of this the people had to flee to Egypt. 2 Kings 25:25

##### b. Fasts were also held in the fourth and tenth months remembering the demise of Jerusalem. Jeremiah 39:2, 2 Kings 25:1-2

##### c. These fasts were not given by God at the giving of the law. They had been self-imposed and held for about 70 years during the Babylonian captivity. 

##### d. On the surface, the question being brought before the priests seems sincere. God's answer through Zechariah will reveal to them a much deeper problem. 

#### 5. Zechariah 7:5b *was it actually for Me that you fasted?* We are reminded of Jesus' conversation with Peter, "Do you love me more than these?". 

##### perhaps it seemed like a good idea at the time and someone suggested they embark on times of fasting. 

##### God is not asking what they were doing or how they should do it but why they did it in the first place  

##### the people religiously held a religious ceremony conmemorating their faith. 

motivation for doing the fasting was not for God. Neither did God ever tell them it should be done. 

Man has not changed much. today during the church age much is not in the name of faith for God but has has not God as a mottive nor His ordination. this can be seen as religios rote but also in more modern churches where people seek to bring 'social justice' remove poverty from the earth, give to multiple causes etc. 
just like the fasting in thise days was not for God, today's multiple sanctimonius activities can be godless. 

#### 6. Zechariah 7:6 *'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves?* 

#### 6. Zechariah 7:7 *'Are not these the words which the LORD proclaimed  by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'*" 

#### 7. Zechariah 7:8-9 *Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying, "Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;* 

#### a. Zechariah 7:10a *and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor*; 

#### b. Zechariah 7:10b *and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.*' 

##### c. this is true religion. not empty rituals like fasting mechanically or rather mornfully over what their own sin had caused. 

#### 8. Zechariah 7:11 "*But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.* 

#### 9. Zechariah 7:12a "**They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets;* 

#### 10. Zechariah 7:12b-13 *therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. "And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;* 

#### 11. Zechariah 7:14 "*but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate.*" 

### **A. Zechariah 8:1-23 - 10 promises of future blessing by the Lord if Hosts**

#### 1. Zechariah 8:1-2 *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, "**Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.*' 

#### 2. Zechariah 8:3a "***Thus says the LORD**, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth,* 

##### a. Zechariah 8:3b *and the mountain of the LORD of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.*' 

#### 3. Zechariah 8:4-5 "***Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.  'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.*' 

#### 4. Zechariah 8:6 "***Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts.* 
#### 5. Zechariah 8:7-8a "***Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem;* 

##### a. Zechariah 8:8b *and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.*' 

#### 6. Zechariah 8:9 "***Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.* 

##### a. Zechariah 8:10 '*For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.* 

##### b. Zechariah 8:11 '*But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts.* 

##### c. Zechariah 8:12a '*For there will be peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew;* 

##### d. Zechariah 8:12b *and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.* 

##### e. Zechariah 8:13 *'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.'* 

#### 7. Zechariah 8:14-15 "*For **thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!* 

##### a. Zechariah 8:16 '*These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.* 

##### b. Zechariah 8:17 '*Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD.*" 

#### 8. Zechariah 8:18-19a *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, "**Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah;* 

##### a. Zechariah 8:19b *so love truth and peace.*' today there is a strong drive towards finding peace. Yet it is at the cost of truth. Truth seemingly divides so people are trying to do away with truth to establish parallelisms instead in order to have "peace"*. 

#### 9. Zechariah 8:20 ***Thus says the LORD of hosts**,*' It will* yet *be* that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. 

##### a. Zechariah 8:21 '*The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go.*" 

##### b. Zechariah 8:22 '*So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.'* 

#### 10. Zechariah 8:23 "***Thus says the LORD of hosts**, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."*'" 

## V. Zechariah 9:1-14:21 - Message #4 - The Two Burdens

### A. The following 5 chapters were probably written at a later date of Zechariah's ministry. The word burden (MASSA) in conection to prophecy should be understood as a catastrophic judgment imposed on the prophet to be discharged with a sense of urgency. 

### B. Zechariah 9:1-11:17 Burden #1 - God's Kingdom is offered and rejected 

#### 1. Zechariah 9:1-8 Judgement of nations in the land, preparing the way for God's Messiah. 

##### a. These verses prophetically explain Alexander the Great's conquest from north to south beginning at Syria, Phoenicia and then Philistia after the battle of Issus in 333 b.C. 

###### i) Hadrach, Hamath and Damascus are cities of **Syria**. 

###### ii) Tyrus and SIdon are principal cities of **Phoenicia**

###### iii) Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod are chief cities of **Philistia**. 

#### 2. Zechariah 9:7 *The burden of the word of the LORD*

#### 3. Zechariah 9:7 is against the land of Hadrach with Damascus as its resting place... uncertain. Hadrach (Chadrak) is a syrian deity. 

##### a. Damascus means a well-watered land in Syriac. 

#### 4. Zechariah 9:7 (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD). This verse could also be translated "for the Lord has his eyes upon men and upon the tribes of Israel..." Zechariah 1:8

##### a. This means that the Lord sees all and takes into account everything and he executes judgment and blessing accordingly. 

#### 5. Zechariah 9:7 And Hamath also, which borders on it; Amos 6:2

#### 6. Zechariah 9:7 *Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.* Cities in Lebanon.

#### 7. Zechariah 9:7 *For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.* 

#### 8. Zechariah 9:7 *Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.* 

#### 9. Zechariah 9:7 *Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.* One of five main Philistine cities. Joshua 13:3 ; 1 Samuel 6:17

#### 10. Zechariah 9:7 *Gaza too will writhe in great pain;* 

#### 11. Zechariah 9:7 *Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded.* 

#### 12. Zechariah 9:7 *Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod,* 

#### 13. Zechariah 9:7 *And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth.* 

#### 14. Zechariah 9:7 *Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.* 

#### 15. Zechariah 9:7 *But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; This was fulfilled when Alexander refrained from destroying Jerusalem.* 

##### a. According to the historian Josephus, Alexander came to Jerusalem and demanded payment of tribute which the Jews ordinarily paid to the Persians. The Jews refused. However that night, the high priest had a dream where God told him to go out to meet Alexander wearing his priestly garments of glory and beauty.

###### i) When Alexander saw the priests come out to meet him wearing their robes, he fell to his face and worshipped. When asked why, he stated he had seen the very same procession in a dream. 

#### 16. Zechariah 9:8 *And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.* Jeremiah 16:17, 

#### 17. Zechariah 9:9 *Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem!* 

#### 18. Zechariah 9:9a *Behold, your king is coming to you;* 500 years prior, Zechariah announced the Messiah. 

#### 19. Zechariah 9:9b *He is just and endowed with salvation, a just king equipped with deliverance! This is great news! 

#### 20. Zechariah 9:9c *Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.* All four gospels state this verse is fulfilled in the "Triumphal Entry" into Jerusalem. 

### B. Zechariah 9:10-10:12 The Lord's promise to restore the nation

#### 1. Zechariah 9:10a *I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim...*  Ephraim here refers to the land of the northern kingdom of Israel.

#### 2. Zechariah 9:10b *And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations;* 

#### 3. Zechariah 9:10c *And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.* 

#### 4. Zechariah 9:11a *As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free...*This is New Covenant language. Isaiah 61:1, Matthew 26:28

##### a. Hebrews 9:11 *But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;*

##### b. Hebrews 9:12 *and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.*

##### c. Hebrews 9:13 *For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,*

##### d. Hebrews 9:14 *how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?*

##### e. Hebrews 9:15 *And for this reason He is the mediator of a **new covenant**, in order that since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.*

##### f. Hebrews 9:16 *For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.*

##### g. Hebrews 9:17 *For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.*

##### h. Hebrews 9:18 *Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.*

##### i. Hebrews 9:19 *For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,*

##### j. Hebrews 9:20 *saying, "THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU."*

##### k. Hebrews 9:21 *And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.*

##### l. Hebrews 9:22 *And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.*

##### m. Hebrews 9:23 *Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.*

##### n. Hebrews 9:24 *For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;*

##### o. Hebrews 9:25 *nor was it that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood not his own.*

##### p. Hebrews 9:26 *Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.*

#### 5. Zechariah 9:11b *from the waterless pit.*..Luke 16:24, 

#### 6. Zechariah 1:7 *Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope;* 

#### 7. Zechariah 1:7 *This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.* 

#### 8. Zechariah 1:7 *For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim.* This refers to a reunited Israel, both Judah (2 southern tribes) and Ephraim (10 northern tribes) together, which for about 1000 years had been separated. 

#### 9. Zechariah 1:7 *And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece;* 

#### 10. Zechariah 1:7 *And I will make you like a warrior's sword.* Then the LORD will appear over them, 

#### 11. And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. 

#### 12. Zechariah 1:7 The LORD of hosts will defend them. 

##### a. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; 
##### b. And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine; 
##### c. And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, 
##### d. Drenched like the corners of the altar. 

#### 13. Zechariah 1:7 And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; 

#### 14. Zechariah 1:7 For *they are as* the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. 

#### 15. For what comeliness and beauty *will be* theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. 

#### 16. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—

#### The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to *each* man. 

#### 17. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; 

#### They comfort in vain. Therefore *the people* wander like sheep, 

#### They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. 

#### "My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 "From them will come the cornerstone, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 From them the tent peg, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 From them the bow of battle, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 From them every ruler, *all* of them together. 

#### "They will be as mighty men, 
Treading down *the enemy*
in the mire of the streets in battle; 
And they will fight, 
for the LORD *will be* with them; 
And the riders on horses will be put to shame. 
"I will strengthen the house of Judah, 
And I will save the house of Joseph, 
And I will bring them back, 
Because I have had compassion on them; 
And they will be as though I had not rejected them, 
For I am the LORD their God 
and I will answer them. 

"Ephraim will be like a mighty man, 
And their heart will be glad 
as if *from* wine; 
Indeed, their children will see *it* and be glad, 
Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. 
"I will whistle for them 
to gather them together, 
For I have redeemed them; 
And they will be as numerous as they were before. 
"When I scatter them among the peoples, 
They will remember Me in far countries, 
And they 
with their children 
will live and come back. 
"I will bring them back 
from the land of Egypt 
And gather them from Assyria; 
And I will bring them 
into the land of Gilead 
and Lebanon 
Until no *room* can be found for them. 
"And they will pass 
through the sea *of* distress 
And He will strike the waves in the sea, 

So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; 
And the pride of Assyria will be brought down 
And the scepter of Egypt will depart. 
"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, 
And in His name they will walk," 
declares the LORD. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Open your doors, O Lebanon, 
That a fire may feed on your cedars. 
Wail, O cypress, 
for the cedar has fallen, 
Because the glorious *trees* have been destroyed; 

Wail, O oaks of Bashan, 
For the impenetrable forest has come down. 
There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, 
For their glory is ruined; 
There is a sound of the young lions' roar, 
For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Thus says the LORD my God, 
"Pasture the flock 
*doomed* to slaughter. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 "Those who buy them 
slay them and go unpunished, 
and *each of* those 
who sell them says, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 'Blessed be the LORD, 
for I have become rich!' 
And their own shepherds have no pity on them. 
"For I will no longer have pity 
on the inhabitants of the land," 
declares the LORD; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, 
each into another's power 
and into the power of his king; 
and they will strike the land, 
and I will not deliver *them* from their power." 

#### Zechariah 1:7 So I pastured the flock 
*doomed* to slaughter, 
hence the afflicted of the flock. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 And I took for myself two staffs: 

#### Zechariah 1:7 the one I called Favor 

#### Zechariah 1:7 and the other I called Union; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 so I pastured the flock. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 for my soul was impatient with them, 
and their soul also was weary of me. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then I said, "I will not pasture you. 
What is to die, let it die, 
and what is to be annihilated, 
let it be annihilated; 
and let those who are left 
eat one another's flesh." 

#### Zechariah 1:7 I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 So it was broken on that day, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give *me* my wages; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty *shekels* of silver as my wages. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 *that* magnificent price at which I was valued by them." 

#### Zechariah 1:7 So I took the thirty *shekels* of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 "The LORD said to me, Take again for yourself 
the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 
"For behold, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land 

who will not care for the perishing, 
seek the scattered, 
heal the broken, 
or sustain the one standing, 
but will devour the flesh of the fat *sheep* and tear off their hoofs. 
"Woe to the worthless shepherd 
Who leaves the flock! 
A sword will be on his arm 
And on his right eye! 
His arm will be totally withered 

And his right eye will be blind." 

### Zechariah 12:1-14:21 Burden #2 - Messiah's Second Coming

#### Zechariah 1:7 The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 

*Thus* declares the LORD 
who stretches out the heavens, 
lays the foundation of the earth, 
and forms the spirit of man within him, 

#### Zechariah 1:7 "Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem 
a cup that causes reeling 
to all the peoples around; 
and when the siege is against Jerusalem, 
it will also be against Judah. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 "It will come about 
in that day 
that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone 
for all the peoples; 
all who lift it will be severely injured. 
And all the nations of the earth 
will be gathered against it. 
"In that day," declares the LORD, 
"I will strike every horse with bewilderment 
and his rider with madness. 
But I will watch over the house of Judah, 
while I strike every horse of the peoples 
with blindness. 
"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 
'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
through the LORD of hosts, their God.' 
"In that day 
I will make the clans of Judah 
like a firepot 
among pieces of wood 
and a flaming torch among sheaves, 
so they will consume on the right hand 
and on the left all the surrounding peoples, 
while the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. 
"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, 
so that the glory of the house of David 
and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
will not be magnified above Judah. 
"In that day 
the LORD will defend 
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
and the one who is feeble among them 
in that day will be like David, 
and the house of David *will be* like God, 
like the angel of the LORD before them. 
"And in that day 
I will set about 
to destroy all the nations 
that come against Jerusalem. 
"I will pour out on the house of David 
and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
the Spirit of grace 
and of supplication, 
so that they will look on Me 
whom they have pierced; 
and they will mourn for Him, 
as one mourns for an only son, 
and they will weep bitterly over Him 
like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. 
"In that day 
there will be great mourning 
in Jerusalem,
like the mourning of Hadadrimmon 
in the plain of Megiddo. 
"The land will mourn, 
every family by itself; 
the family of the house of David 
by itself 
and their wives 
by themselves; 
the family of the house of Nathan 
by itself 
and their wives 
by themselves; 
the family of the house of Levi 
by itself 
and their wives 
by themselves; 
the family of the Shimeites 
by itself 
and their wives 
by themselves; 
all the families 
that remain, 
every family 
by itself 
and their wives 
by themselves. 
"In that day 
a fountain will be opened 
for the house of David and 
for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
for sin and for impurity. 
"It will come about in that day," 
declares the LORD of hosts, 
"that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, 
and they will no longer be remembered; 
and I will also remove the prophets 
and the unclean spirit from the land. 
"And if anyone still prophesies, 
then his father and mother 
who gave birth to him 
will say to him, 
'You shall not live, 
for you have spoken 
falsely in the name of the LORD'; 
and his father and mother 
who gave birth to him 
will pierce him through 
when he prophesies. 
"Also it will come about 
in that day 
that the prophets will each be ashamed 
of his vision when he prophesies, 
and they will not put on a hairy robe 
in order to deceive; 
but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; 
I am a tiller of the ground, 
for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.' 
"And one will say to him, 
'What are these wounds between your arms?' 
Then he will say, 
'*Those* with which I was wounded 
in the house of my friends.' 

#### 1. Zechariah 1:7 "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. 

#### 2. Zechariah 1:7 "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. We are not explained who the Shepherd is until Jesus quotes this verse giving us the time of fulfillment and the identity of the Shepherd and sheep. 

##### a. Mark 14:27-28  *And Jesus *said to them, "You will all fall away, because it is written, 'I WILL STRIKE DOWN THE SHEPHERD, AND THE SHEEP SHALL BE SCATTERED.' "But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."* Jesus quotes Zechariah where the Lord of Hosts declares he will Strike the Shepherd, then He continues what was written to say He would be raised again. This beautifully ties Zechariah in with the Gospel account. 

##### b. Strike (NAKAH) is to smite, to be stricken, a blow, to wound. 

##### c. Isaiah 53:4 *Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, **Smitten of God**, and afflicted.*

###### i) Jesus was smitten of God. The next verse goes on to explain why...

###### ii) Isaiah 53:5 *But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His **scourging** we are healed.* 

###### iii) The word *scourging* (singular) here is another word for blow or wound. The reason Christ was smitten was for our healing. The blow that Jesus received, His death on the cross, resulted in the forgiveness of our sins. 

##### d. Notice that God had told Zechariah He would do this. He would *strike down the Shepherd*, *turn His hand against the little ones* and *raise* the Shepherd back up. This prophecy refers to the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 

###### The Gospel was God' eternal plan for the redemption of man.

#### "It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off *and* perish; 
But the third will be left in it. 
"And I will bring the third part through the fire, 
Refine them as silver is refined, 
And test them as gold is tested. 
They will call on My name, 
And I will answer them; 
I will say, 'They are My people,' 
And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'" 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Behold, a day is coming for the LORD 
when the spoil taken from you 
will be divided among you. 
For I will gather all the nations 
against Jerusalem to battle, 
and the city will be captured, 
the houses plundered, 
the women ravished 
and half of the city exiled, 
but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then the LORD will go forth 
and fight against those nations, 
as when He fights on a day of battle. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 In that day 
His feet will stand 
on the Mount of Olives, 
which is in front of Jerusalem 
on the east; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 and the Mount of Olives 
will be split in its middle 
from east to west 
by a very large valley, 
so that half of the mountain 
will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. 
You will flee by the valley of My mountains, 
for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; 
yes, you will flee 
just as you fled before the earthquake 
in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then the LORD, my God, will come, 
*and* all the holy ones with Him! 

#### Zechariah 1:7 In that day 
there will be no light; 
the luminaries will dwindle. 
For it will be a unique day 
which is known to the LORD, 
neither day nor night, 
but it will come about that at evening time 
there will be light. 
	
#### Zechariah 1:7 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, 
half of them toward the eastern sea 
and the other half toward the western sea; 
it will be in summer 
as well as in winter. 
And the LORD will be king 
over all the earth; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 in that day 
the LORD will be *the only* one, 
and His name *the only* one. 
All the land will be changed 
into a plain from Geba 
to Rimmon 
south of Jerusalem; 
but Jerusalem will rise 
and remain on its site 
from Benjamin's Gate 
as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, 
and from the Tower of Hananel 
to the king's wine presses. 
People will live in it, 
and there will no longer be a curse, 
for Jerusalem will dwell in security. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Now this will be the plague 
with which the LORD 
will strike all the peoples 
who have gone to war 
against Jerusalem; 
their flesh will rot 
while they stand on their feet, 
and their eyes will rot in their sockets, 
and their tongue will rot in their mouth. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 It will come about in that day 
that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; 
and they will seize one another's hand, 
and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. 
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; 
and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, 
gold and silver and garments 
in great abundance. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 So also like this plague 
will be the plague 
on the horse, 
the mule, 
the camel, 
the donkey 
and all the cattle that will be in those camps. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 Then it will come about 
that any 
who are left of all the nations 
that went against Jerusalem 
will go up from year to year 
to worship the King, 
the LORD of hosts, 
and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 And it will be that 
whichever of the families 
of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem 
to worship the King, 
the LORD of hosts, 
there will be no rain on them. 
If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, 
then no *rain will fall* on them; 
it will be the plague 
with which the LORD 
smites the nations 
who do not go up 
to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 
This will be the punishment of Egypt, 
and the punishment of all the nations 
who do not go up 
to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 

#### Zechariah 1:7 In that day 
there will *be inscribed* 
on the bells of the horses, 
"HOLY TO THE LORD." 

#### Zechariah 1:7 And the cooking pots 
in the LORD'S house 
will be like the bowls before the altar. 
Every cooking pot 
in Jerusalem and in Judah 
will be holy to the LORD of hosts; 

#### Zechariah 1:7 and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. 

# And there will no longer be a Canaanite
in the house of the LORD of hosts 
in that day.
