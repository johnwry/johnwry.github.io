# Zechariah 1:1-6 Message #1

## Zechariah 1:1-6 "God invites Judah to return to Himself!"

### Zechariah 1:1 *In the eighth month of the second year of Darius...* This king is not the Darius the Mede we meet during Daniel's time (538-536 BC). This king, __<u>Darius I</u>__, is a successor to Cyrus the Persian. He ruled from 522-486 BC. Ezra 4-6

#### The year is 520 BC. Medo-Persia is in __<u>power</u>__. Zerubbabel has been placed as governor over Judah. 

#### Some dates to help understand where we are in Israel's history.

#####   **722 BC** - The Assyrians conquer Israel to the north

#####   **700 BC** - Isaiah prophesied that a king named Cyrus would be instrumental in returning the people and rebuilding Jerusalem. Isa 44:28, Isa 45:13

#####   **605 BC** - The __<u>EXILE</u>__ begins. The Babylonians conquer Judah.

#####   **586 BC** - The temple is destroyed

#####   **538 BC** - Cyrus makes a decree to set the exiles free and to return to rebuild the temple. Ezra 1:1-4, 6:3

##### **536 BC** - The foundation for the temple begins

###### After the foundation for the temple was laid, the Samaritans began to make trouble to discourage any rebuilding. Ezr 4:1-6:28, 

###### The Samaritan woman and Jesus have a conversation surrounding this issue many centuries later. John 4:19-24 ######

#####   **520 BC** - Darius I reaffirmed Cyrus's decree yet the temple remained in ruins. Ezra 6:1-12, Hag 1:4

######      The rebuilding of the temple begins. Haggai and Zechariah begin their ministry. 

#####   **516 BC** - the Temple is finished

#####   **457 BC** - Artaxerxes I issued a decree to Ezra, giving autonomy to Judah., Ezr 7:12-26

#####   **444 BC** - Artaxerxes I issued a decree to Nehemiah to rebuild __<u>Jersualem</u>__. Neh 2:1-8 

######      The times of the __<u>gentiles</u>__ is set in progress. , Dan 9:24-27, Luk 21:24, Rom 11:25

#### __<u>Haggai</u>__ began prophecying on this same year as well. 

##### Due to setbacks caused by the Samarians, about __<u>17</u>__ years have passed since Cyrus's decree to return to the land and restore the temple. The temple remains in ruins. Esr 4-6

### Zechariah 1:1b *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,* 

#### What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction. It was God's __<u>word</u>__. Heb 1:1, 2 Tim 3:16-17

#### Haggai prophesied in September, October and December but __<u>nothing</u>__ in November. Zechariah's prophecy was in November.

#### Zerubbabel listened and followed what __<u>God</u>__ commanded. Ezra 5:2

#### Even though there was opposition, God told the people to begin rebuilding the temple. The opposition remained __<u>quiet</u>__ until hearing back from king Darius I regarding the authenticity of the decree issued by Cyrus. Ezra 5:5

### Zechariah 1:1c *the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying,* Zech 1:1, Zech 1:7

#### Not much is told to us about Berechiah except he was the __<u>father</u>__ of Zechariah. 

##### Jesus mentioned a martyrd prophet called Zechariah **son of Berechiah** in  Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions this but __<u>leaves</u>__ Berechiah's name out. Luk 11:51

##### It's difficult to know why it is stated this way in Matthew since we don't know how Zechariah dies and there is another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who was a prophet that had lived __<u>300</u>__ years earlier that was killed by the people. 2 Chr. 24:20-22

###### Opción 1: Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. Since they mean the __<u>same</u>__, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus

###### Opción 2: Both Zechariah's may have had fathers __<u>named</u>__ Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually Zechariah's grandfather. 

###### Opción 3: __<u>Error</u>__ in transcription 

###### Opción 4: Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah's __<u>murder</u>__ just the same as he did Abel's. This seems the most plausible option of the 4. 

###### 		Matthew was also familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would have caught his attention to hear Jesus __<u>state</u>__ it. 

#### Iddo, was Zechariah's grandfather. He was a priest. Iddo is __<u>listed</u>__ among those who returned from Babylon.  Neh 12:1-4 	

##### En 520 Zechariah is probably a __<u>young</u>__ man. Zac 2:4 

##### Zechariah was a __<u>prophet</u>__. This was his roll. 

### Zechariah 1:2 *"The LORD was very angry with your fathers.* Having been exiled for __<u>70</u>__ years is proof of this.  2 Chr 36

### Zechariah 1:3 *"Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts,* 

#### Zechariah was to speak God's __<u>word</u>__ to the people, this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua. 

#### Lord of Hosts appears 52 times in Zecharias. The way this title of God is used implies the unlimited __<u>resources</u>__ available at his disposition for his people.  

##### God is rich in __<u>mercy</u>__. Efe 2:4 

##### God is abundant in __<u>power</u>__. Mat 28:18 

#### Zechariah is no false prophet. His message comes from the Lord of hosts himself. This is __<u>crucial</u>__ to see the importance of his message. Thankfully Zerubbabel and Joshua didn't question the authority of Zechariah's message.

### Zechariah 1:3 *"Return to Me," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts.* 

#### The opposite of return is to __<u>forsake</u>__. They had forsaken the Lord needed to return. The result would be God's returning to them as the Lord of hosts to His nation. 

### Zechariah 1:4a *"Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."* God __<u>knew</u>__ their ways were evil. Rev 2:1-7

#### 1. Evil ways and evil deeds are demonstrable yet a return to God is not merely about ceasing to do evil __<u>things</u>__ but a return to fellowship. 

##### A __<u>return</u>__ to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 

### Zechariah 1:4b "*But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD*. The previous generation did not __<u>listen</u>__ to God, they did not change their minds and continued on even expecting the consequences.  Zech 7:11-14

#### God invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious __<u>rote</u>__. Zech 7:4-6, Zech 8:2, Amo 5:21-27,  Col 2:23, 

##### According to the dictionary, rote is mechanical or unthinking routine or repetition. 

###### God hates religious rote as a replacement for a __<u>relationship</u>__ with Himself. Isa 1:12-18, Sant. 1:26

###### Religious rote is considered violence to the law. Eze 22:26, Zep 3:4

##### In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the Athenians on Mars Hill. *So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects*. 

###### An old commentator rephrased __<u>Paul's</u>__ words,  *I perceive that in all things yo are too superstitious*. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23

### Zechariah 1:5 *"Your fathers, where are they?* The great majority of that generation died while in __<u>exile</u>__. Most did not return. Psa 90:10, 

### Zechariah 1:5b *And the prophets, do they live forever?* Now those prophets were gone, their message should have been heeded at the moment it was proclaimed. __<u>Delayed</u>__ obedience is disobedience. 

#### God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God's offer of  __<u>salvatión</u>__ is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jer 26:5, 2 Cor 6:2

### Zechariah 1:6 *"But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers?* ...God had made it abundantly known and clear to everyone. They didn't have an __<u>excuse</u>__.

### Zechariah 1:6b *Then they repented and said, 'As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.*..the term *repented* is a bit __<u>confusing</u>__ here. 

#### The word  SHUB "*repented*" could also be translated as "*returned*" (KJV).   Compare the use of __<u>SHUB</u>__ in Zec 1:3 with Zec 1:6

##### If we are to think they repented, then they are being referred to in a positive light. Yet the whole argument to the admonition hinges on the fact that the previous generation did not do what was right. 

##### The purpose then must be to show the previous generation had returned, accepting their fate as from God for doing wrong but were still not trusting God.  This present generation should not take that approach with God, but rather repent. 

#### The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of __<u>thinking</u>__, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said.  Eze 20:43 

##### A short note about __<u>biblical</u>__ repentance: 

###### It's not merely recognizing the __<u>wrong</u>__ you have done. It's not a focus on the admission of guilt. Mat 27:3-5

###### It's not feeling __<u>sorrow</u>__ for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. 

###### 		It is true that God's kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Rom 2:4, 2 Cor 7:9

###### It's not ceasing from __<u>sin</u>__, promising not to sin or changing one's life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase "repent of your sins" is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 does say "*repent **for** the forgiveness of sins*".  

###### It's not something you __<u>measure</u>__ to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance.  This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today.  The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic.  Luk 3:8-18, 

###### Biblical repentance is changing one's __<u>mind</u>__  towards God, you change your thinking regarding what you are trusting in to trust God. Act 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isa 1:18, Heb 6:1

###### 		For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God's offer made through the __<u>Gospel</u>__ (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luk 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luk 13:1-5

###### 		Or for a believer in error should __<u>repent</u>__ (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Rev 2:21, Rev 3:3, Rev 3:19, 1 Jn 1:9, Rom 6:1-11, Rom 8:12-13, Gal 5:16



### Conclusion of Message #1

> God invited this generation to return to himself. It was an invitation to a relationship of trust and dependance in God. The previous generation had disobeyed God. They returned physically to the land, they even recognized their error but never changed their minds and placed their faith in God alone. Returning to God is an act of faith (changing one's mind towards God) not by external works (ie returning to the land, rebuilding the temple).

# Zechariah 1:7-6:15 - Message #2 - Eight Visions

The eight visions Zechariah were given to serve as an encouragement to the nation.  Essentially a greater understanding of Messiah and His kingdom is given. Throughout history God has been progressively revealing His redemptive plan through His Son. 

Mat 1:17 *So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen generations.* Matthew appears to be dividing Jewish history into forms of ruling. It went from aristocracy, to monarchy,  to oligarchy, to Messiah. Jesus Christ the son of Abraham, the son of David, is presented as the Messiah (called the Christ). Matt 1:1, John 4:25, Luk 2:11

​	The Messiah was recognized by:

​	The blind - Joh 9:38

​	The demons - Luk 4:41

​	The elderly - Luk 2:25-38

​	Fishermen. - Luk 9:20, 

​	Criminals - Luke 23:39-42

​	The Scriptures - Luke 24:46, Act 2:31, 

​	Women - Joh 11:27

​	Early believers - Act 5:42

​	Samarians - Acts 8:12

​	Pious Jews - Act 18:5

​	The Law - Gal 3:24

Zechariah received these 8 visions in one night.

## Zechariah 1:7-17 The vision of a rider among the myrtle Trees

###  Zechariah 1:7 *On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius,* ...three months after receiving the first message, Zechariah receives another message from the Lord in the form of 8 __<u>visions</u>__ in one night. Zech 1:1

### Zechariah 1:7b *the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:* God __<u>spoke</u>__ again to Zechariah and it happened like this...

#### Once again Zechariah gives his ancestry. Zechariah was from a priestly line __<u>serving</u>__ as a prophet. 

### Zechariah 1:8a  *I saw at night...* This is not a __<u>dream</u>__, it is a __vision__, he received while awake at night. Visions were received while awake and dreams are revelations while asleep. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Num 12:6

### Zechariah 1:8b *and behold, a man was riding on a red horse...* The first thing Zechariah saw was a man on a __<u>red</u>__ horse. In verse 11 we are told this man is the angel of the Lord.

#### Horses back then were the fastest __<u>form</u>__ of travel. Horses are also often seen in contexts dealing with war.

#### The color red is often associated with __<u>blood</u>__ and or war. 

#### Here we see the angel of the Lord is ready to make __<u>war</u>__ while in Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.

### Zechariah 1:8b *and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine,* Interestingly, __<u>myrtle</u>__ trees are mentioned in other passages when God says he will turn the wilderness to blossom. Isa 41:19 

#### The myrtle tree has dark green, scented leaves, delicate starry __<u>white</u>__ flowers and dark-colored berries, which are eaten.

#### It is rare to see a tree growing in the desert. One day God's promise to Israel is that He will make the desert blossom. The myrtle tree is a reminder of this. God will turn briars into __<u>myrtle</u>__ trees. Isa 55:13

#### Myrtle was used during the __<u>feast</u>__ of tabernacles to build the booths among other things. Neh 8:15 

#### Esther's name in Hebrew is Myrtle. Esth 2:7

### Zechariah 1:8c *with red, sorrel and white horses behind him.* The man among the myrtle trees in not the only one on a red horse. No other information is given by the angel regarding the meaning of the colours of the horses. 

#### There are horses and chariots mentioned in Zechariah 6:2-7 and the __<u>four</u>__ horsemen in Revelation 6. Some believe these are related and to an extent they may be but care must be taken not to argue a case where Scripture is silent. 

##### The number of different colours of horses mentioned in chapter 1 are __<u>three</u>__ while in chapter 6 there are four.  

##### Since the interpreting angel just *ignores* the colours, we can see the emphasis of the vision is on something else. We can __<u>speculate</u>__ as to the meaning of the colours but we should take care not to be dogmatic. 

### Zechariah 1:9a *Then I said, "My lord, what are these?"*  Zechariah wants to know the __<u>meaning</u>__ of the vision. 

### Zechariah 1:9b *And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "I will show you what these are."* It is not the receptor's task to interpret some vague dream. The explanation of the __<u>vision</u>__ is given so that Zechariah knows exactly what God is communicating. Rev 1:1, 2 Cor 10:5

### Zechariah 1:10a *And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said,* Zechariah hears the __<u>rider</u>__ himself, the Angel of the Lord speaks.

### Zechariah 1:10b *"These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth."* Evidently this __<u>angelic</u>__ patrol sent to gather information regarding the current status of the earth. 

#### Though Satan is the prince and power of the air and has been given authority over the earth it does not mean God is not in complete __<u>control</u>__ and watching all things. 

### Zechariah 1:11a *So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees* The agents report back to the angel of the Lord of what they observed __<u>among</u>__ the nations.  The angel of the Lord will in turn report to the Father. 

#### This is the same angel of the Lord who battled for Israel before and the King of Syria is forced to __<u>flee</u>__. Isa 37:36-37

#### The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 4 different times in Zechariah (Zech 1, 3, 6, 12). This “*man among the myrtle trees*” was the __<u>angel</u>__ of the Lord (vv. 11–13).

#####  Many scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead, the Son of God, who in Old Testament times makes temporary preincarnate appearances on __<u>earth</u>__. 

#### Scripture records the angel of the Lord appearing to many people throughout __<u>history</u>__.  

##### __<u>Hagar</u>__. Gen. 16:7–14 

##### __<u>Abraham</u>__. Gen 18; 22:11–18

##### __<u>Jacob</u>__. Gen 31:11, 13 

##### __<u>Moses</u>__. Ex. 3

##### __<u>Gideon</u>__. Judg. 6:11–23

##### Samson’s __<u>parents</u>__. Judg. 13

##### __<u>Joseph</u>__ in a dream prior to the birth of Jesus. Matt 1:24 

#### The ultimate fulfillment of this prophecy (the first vision) will be when the Messiah is seen wearing red making __<u>war</u>__ against the nations. Rev 19:11-13

### Zechariah 1:11b *and said, "We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet."* To the reader the initial thought might be, "Peace! All is well!". The response by the angel of the Lord reflects things are far from __<u>right</u>__ in order to be at peace. 

#### There's nothing wrong with peace as long as it is attained the right way. At this point in history, the gentile nations were at peace at the __<u>expense</u>__ of God's nation Israel. God has no regard for man's way of peace apart from Him. 

#### True, ultimate world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ __<u>rules</u>__ from His throne from Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4 

#### According to Scripture, __<u>peace</u>__ does not come until Babylon is destroyed. Rev 17-18, Zech 5

### Zechariah 1:12 *Then the angel of the LORD said, "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?"* God had said the time would be __<u>70</u>__ years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God, "how much longer are your people to suffer?" Jer 29:10

#### The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 17 __<u>extra</u>__ years have passed and yet there's still no temple, no city and it still lies unprotected and yet "*the earth is peaceful and quiet*".  

##### The nations were __<u>fine</u>__ with Israel not having the autonomy of their God given land! Jer 29:10, Jer 6:14

#### The angel of the Lord's words reflect his __<u>empathy</u>__ for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are "*at peace*".  

#### The angel of the Lord intercedes before the Lord on behalf of the __<u>people</u>__. Zech 1:12

##### In a similar manner, Christ intercedes for the church __<u>today</u>__. 1 Joh 2:1, Heb 7:25, Rom 8:34

#### For centuries, “*How long?*” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of __<u>Israel</u>__. Psa 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2 

##### “*How long?*” is also the cry of the martyred __<u>saints</u>__ in heaven as they await God to avenge them. Rev. 6:10 

#### "*How long...*" It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the __<u>epochs</u>__ of things. Act 1:7

#### It was told to Daniel that Israel's return would ultimately be 70 units of 7. This comes to a total of __<u>490</u>__ years.  These yet have to be fulfilled in their purpose. Dan 9:24-27 

##### Finally, when Babylon (the personification of the kingdom of __<u>man</u>__ throughout Scripture) is destroyed, then there will be peace. Isa 14:3-7 

#### The greatest demonstration of God's compassion is in the giving of His __<u>Son</u>__. He took upon Himself the sins of the world. Joh 3:16, Rom 5:8, 2 John 2:2, 2 Cor 5:21

### Zechariah 1:13 *The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.* The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the "interrogation" and responds with __<u>kind</u>__ words. Col 4:6 

#### Interestingly, the Lord's answer is not to the angel of the Lord, rather it is directed at the interpreting angel to __<u>relate</u>__ it to Zechariah. 

#### God answered with compassion. One of the primary purposes of prophecy is always to encourage and give __<u>hope</u>__. To know you on the winning side is a source of comfort. 

### Zechariah 1:14a *So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, "Proclaim, saying*..." This message is not to be kept hidden, it is to be announced. As a prophet Zechariah's task is not to receive the message for himself but to __<u>relate</u>__ God's message to the people. Heb 1:1-2

#### This is in direct response to the intercessory __<u>request</u>__ made by the angel of the Lord. Zech 1:12

### Zechariah 1:14b *'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous*... The reader is reminded the Lord of hosts is __<u>far</u>__ from indifferent of His nation.  

#### This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it seemed God didn't care or had somehow forgotten his __<u>promise</u>__. 

#### God's jealousy for Israel means that He has a strong __<u>desire</u>__ for Israel. Isa 54:8, Heb 12:6-7

### Zechariah 1:14c *for Jerusalem and Zion.*  Many times in Scripture, Zion is synonymous with Jerusalem. Here, the use of Zion would bring up __<u>Davidic</u>__ covenant terminology to the Jew. See first usage of Zion in 2 Samuel 5:7, 1 King 8:1

#### God has put his king (David) on mount Zion.  Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's __<u>throne</u>__ will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psa 2:6, Zech 6:12-13

#### Zion is the mountain on which God's house, the temple, __<u>stands</u>__. Mic 3:12 ####

#### Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in __<u>setting</u>__ up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Mic 4:1, 3 

#### A prophecy is given to "the daughter of Zion" regarding her __<u>king</u>__. This is fulfilled by Jesus who comes riding into the city on a donkey.  Matt 21:4

#### Zion will be the place where God will __<u>impart</u>__ his knowledge and glory to the nations. Mic 4:2 

### Zechariah 1:15 *"But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster..."* God had been a little angry with __<u>Israel</u>__ which lasted 70 years but is now very angry with the nations. 

#### The Lord is very angry at the nations or being at __<u>ease</u>__ while His people suffer for lack of their land that He himself had deeded to them.  The nations did nothing about helping Judah, in fact, "*they furthered the disaster*." They actively went __<u>against</u>__ Israel. Zech 1:11, Jer 6:14

#### The Lord had also said this would happen and had even promised to __<u>punish</u>__ the nations (specifically in this case the Chaldeans) for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1 

### Zechariah 1:16a *'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion...* We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort. 

### Zechariah 1:16b *My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem."*' After decades of the temple being demolished and the city pulverized, God's favour of Israel will once again be visible when you see the temple rebuilt and Jerusalem a city where the borders are defined. 

#### About 200 years earlier, God had announced through the prophet __<u>Isaiah</u>__ that He would do this....*"It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"* Isa 44:28

#### Zechariah adds more information to Isaiah's prophecy. It will be under Zerubbabel that the __<u>temple</u>__ will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10 

### Zechariah 1:17a *"Again, proclaim, saying,* We see an example of how God speaks multiple times and in different ways so everyone has ample opportunity to __<u>hear</u>__ what He is about to do. Isa 65:2, Rom 10:21

### Zechariah 1:17b *'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem...'* The Lord of hosts (He who __<u>battles</u>__ for them) is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zech 6:15

#### While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah's time, verse 17 is clearly yet future since it has yet to happen. 

#### Prophecy is always given by God in a __<u>way</u>__ that when it is fulfilled "*...you will know that I am the Lord*" Ex 6:7

##### When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with __<u>Him</u>__. Zech 13:9

## Zechariah 1:18-21 The vision of four horns and four craftsmen

###  Zechariah 1:18 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns*. Horns used this way, typically represent political powers, national leaders or __<u>nations</u>__. Psa 75:10, Jer 48:25, Dan 7:24,  8, Rev 12, 13, 17

### Zechariah 1:19a *So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these?" And he answered me, "These are the horns which have scattered..."* We aren't given the identity of these horns except that they are nations. At least two main options exist. 

#### Option 1: The four horns had already come. This could refer to the four __<u>nations</u>__ (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites)  God used to scatter Judah.  2 King 24:2

#### Option 2: The __<u>four</u>__ horns had begun but are not yet completed. The scattering is in reference to Judah. Babylon would be the first then Medo Persia then Greece were all guilty. The forth would be referring to Rome which in one way or another continues today. Jer 50:17-18, Eze 34:11-24 

##### This option appears to be the __<u>most</u>__ plausible option.  

##### This option would also __<u>align</u>__ with Daniel's four horns. Dan 7 

### Zechariah 1:19b *Judah, Israel and Jerusalem...*Is the order given important? Later these are summed up as __<u>Judah</u>__. Zech 1:21

### Zechariah 1:20 *Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen*. The Lord was interested that Zechariah see the __<u>four</u>__ craftsmen. 

#### Craftsmen were skilled workers in __<u>metal</u>__ or wood. Hos 13:2, 2 Chr 29:5

### Zechariah 1:21 *I said, "What are these coming to do?" And he said, "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these craftsmen have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it."* Even though the horns would scatter __<u>Judah</u>__, the four craftsmen would terrify these nations and throw them down. 

#### This was to encourage the reader that though things seemed helpless, they could place their __<u>hope</u>__ and trust in the Lord's word to know who would ultimately have the last word. 

#### Ultimately the demise of __<u>Rome</u>__ (the fourth horn) is by the Craftsman that comes from heaven, the Rock not made with hands that destroys the whole statue. Dan 2 

## Zechariah 2:1-13 The vision of the measuring of Jerusalem

###  Zechariah 2:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand.* Zechariah then sees a man who had an instrument to measure in his __<u>hand</u>__. 

### Zechariah 2:2 *So I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is."* Zechariah asks where the __<u>man</u>__ might be going.  

#### In 586 BC, about 60 years earlier, the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem and the temple. They took everyone exile except for the poorest of the land who eventually revolted against the man who was left in charge and they fled to __<u>Egypt</u>__ for fear of the Babylonians. 2 King 24-25, Jer 39, 52, 2 Chr 36:17-21

### Zechariah 2:3 *And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him,* Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to __<u>meet</u>__ another angel. 

### Zechariah 2:4 *and said to him, "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it.* The other angel tells the interpreting __<u>angel</u>__ to *run* and tell Zechariah about the future state of Jerusalem! 

#### This is the explanation to the vision of the man who goes to measure Jerusalem. Zech 2:1-2

#### Back in the first vision God had said, "*I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.*" Zech 1:16

#### Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be rebuilt with the temple in her midst and the city filled with multitudes of men and livestock would have been of great encouragement! This would indeed __<u>promote</u>__ initiative for the rebuilding of the temple. Zech 9:12

##### Without hope it is very difficult to begin a new endeavor. Hope allows one to "see" the __<u>good</u>__ in the future even perhaps, despite difficult times in the present in order to press onward. 1 Tim 4:10, 1 Tim 5:5, 1 Jn 3:3

## Zechariah 2:5-13 The Lord Jesus Christ foretells He will be sent by the Lord of Hosts to the world. He will dwell in the midst of Israel once again and the nations will __<u>attach</u>__ themselves to her. 

### Zechariah 2:5 *'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"*  the Lord here is Christ. He himself says He will be the source of glory from within and the impenetrable protecting __<u>wall</u>__ of fire around the city. Zeph 3:15, Luk 2:25-32,  Mat 25:31, 

### Zechariah 2:6 *"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD.* Though this dispersion was caused originally by the __<u>Assyrians</u>__, this return is referring to the end times.  Jer 3:18

### Zechariah 2:7 *"Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon."*  Babylon is to the __<u>east</u>__ of Jerusalem. 

#### Two religious entities are contrasted here. Zion and daughter of Babylon.  The daugher of Zion refers to those Israelites who put their trust in God while the daughter of Babylon is the Chaldean __<u>system</u>__ of religion. Isa 47, Psa 137:8, Rev 17 

##### This is one and the same with the religious system started in __<u>Babel</u>__ which continues on until the end of man's rule. Rev 17:5

### Zechariah 2:8a *For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you...* God sends the __<u>Lord</u>__  against the nations to bring about glory.  Psa 2

### God's sent one is none other than __<u>God</u>__, the Lord of hosts himself. 

### Zechariah 2:8b *for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye.*  God is deeply devoted over His possession, Israel. He who touches the apple of His eye (Israel), goes __<u>against</u>__ the very Lord of hosts! Deut 32:9-10 

#### The Church is also God's cherished possession. Christ paid a very __<u>high</u>__ cost to redeem her. He laid down his very life for her. 1 Pet 1:18-19

### Zechariah 2:9a *"For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves.* God will turn everything around. The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately *shatter them like earthenware* and give the nations as an inheritance to His __<u>Son</u>__. Psa 2, Psa 110

### Zechariah 2:9b *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me.* This phrase appears 4 times in Zechariah. God is always communicating in a way so that Scripture's fulfillment is literal and so that everyone knows it's as He __<u>said</u>__ it would be.  Acts 2:36

### Zechariah is foretelling about God sending His __<u>Son</u>__ to the world. Psa 2:7, Rom 1:1-4, Gal 4:4, 1 Jn 4:9-10, Jn 3:16

#### To place __<u>faith</u>__ in Jesus Christ essentially means to place one's hope in who He is and what he's done and his promises to all who believe. Eph 1:12, Eph 1:18, Col 1:5, Col 1:23, Tit 1:2, Tit 3:7

#### Christ himself is our __<u>hope</u>__. This hope is a sure thing not dependent upon our good behavior but on his completed and accepted work of the cross. 1 Tim 1:1, Tit 2:13, 1 Pet 1:3

#### As believers we can __<u>abound</u>__ in hope as we walk by faith. Rom 15:13, Col 1:27, Heb 10:23, 1 Pet 1:13, 1 Tim 4:10, Heb 6:18-20

### Zechariah 2:10 *"Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD.* The Lord himself, the Son of God will __<u>dwell</u>__ in her midst. Joh 1:14,  

### Though Jesus did come and bodily dwelt in Israel, the ultimate, eternal fulfillment of this is during the __<u>Messianic</u>__ reign. Rev 21:3, Isa 9:6-7

### Here the daughter of __<u>Zion</u>__ is placed in contrast with the daughter of Babylon. 

#### Ultimately God will triumph over the system of __<u>man</u>__. To know they are one the winning side was an encouraging truth to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zech 9:9

### Zechariah 2:11a *"Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people.* Clearly a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel's __<u>rule</u>__.

##### When God will __<u>destroy</u>__ the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zech 12:3, 9 

##### When God will remove all __<u>idolatry</u>__ from the land. Zech 13:2 

##### When Messiah __<u>stands</u>__ on the mount of Olives. He will reign over all the earth from Zion. Zech 14:4, 9

### Zechariah 2:11b *Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you.* Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ will one day __<u>dwell</u>__ in their midst forever. The Lord of hosts will send the Lord to them. Joh 1:11, 14

### Zechariah 2:12 *"The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.* Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present God has placed His program with them on hold. In the day of the Lord though, God will once again work directly in and through __<u>Israel</u>__. Deut 32:9, Jer 7:7, Rom 11:11-12, 25

### Zechariah 2:13 *"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."* God is angered at the current situation and laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His __<u>house</u>__, the temple. 

## Zechariah 3:1-10 The vision of Joshua the high priest

###  Zechariah 3:1 *Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him.* We see here a picture of what is constantly occurring. Satan constantly accuses while the angel of the __<u>Lord</u>__ (Christ) is seen interceding. 

####  This is true today during the __<u>church</u>__ age as well and will continue until all access to heaven is taken away from Satan when the Day of the Lord begins and Satan is thrown to remain on earth until the end of the Millennium where he is thrown into the lake of fire forever.

### Zechariah 3:2 *The LORD said to Satan, "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!* Satan's limits are stated regarding Jerusalem. God had chosen it and the angel of the Lord (Christ) calls for the Lord (God the Father) to rebuke Satan. 

### *Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?"* Though the people are __<u>guilty</u>__ and deserving of eternal condemnation, God delivered them. Amo 4:11 

#### *Brand* is the word UD meaning to take together as in the case of raking embers __<u>together</u>__. 

#### *Plucked* is the word NATSAL meaning to __<u>snatch</u>__ away, deliver, rescue, save, strip, plunder. 

#### We too are like embers plucked from the fire. Colossians 1:13

### Zechariah 3:3 *Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel.* Zechariah saw  filthy garments on Joshua,  evidence of Joshua's guilt. 

### Here Joshua as high priest is symbolic of the people's condition before God. 

### Zechariah 3:4a *He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him."* At the command of the angel of the Lord, the dirty garments are __<u>removed</u>__. Jude 1:24, 1 John 2:2

### Zechariah 3:4b *Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes."* Joshua is told his __<u>iniquity</u>__ (dirty garments) has been removed. He will be clothed in garments of rejoicing. Rom 4:7-8

#### The filthy garments are the priest's guilt. Even man's righteous deeds are like a filthy garment. Isa 64:6

#### It is the angel of the Lord who removes any iniquity.  This, obviously on the basis of his successful work of the cross! Rom 3:24-26

#### Through faith in the finished, substitutionary work of Christ, God removes our filthy garments and gives us festal robes. Isa 61:10, Rev 7:9, Rev 22:14 

#### One day, all of Israel will be saved. They will have their sins removed and reestablished in a right standing with God. Dan 9:24-27 

#### This means though the priests were guilty, they have received forgiveness through their faith in Messiah. One day the Jewish priests will be believers. 

### Zechariah 3:5a *Then I said, "Let them put a clean turban on his head." So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments,* Zechariah is moved and adds that the turban be replaced for a clean one. The __<u>tunic</u>__ was part of the high priestly garments commanded by God. Ex 28:4, Lev 8:9

### Zechariah 3:5b *while the angel of the LORD was standing by.* He is standing right there making sure the changing of clothes takes place. One day this very angel of the Lord (Christ himself) would take on humanity and in place of man take on the role of sacrificial __<u>lamb</u>__, taking on the sins of mankind and paying the necessary price for man's redemption. Amazing grace how sweet the sound! 

### Zechariah 3:6 *And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying,* 

### Zechariah 3:7a *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service,* 

#### Zechariah 3:7b *then you will also govern My house...* God gave the priests the privilege to govern the temple if they walked in His __<u>ways</u>__. Eze 44:15-16 

##### Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all __<u>doubt</u>__ that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27

###### Instead of walking by faith in their God-given duties as priests, they not only created laws to protect the Mosaic law but they themselves failed to __<u>keep</u>__ them, and abused the privileges God gave them. Rom 2:16-3:8

#### Zechariah 3:7c *and also have charge of My courts,* The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests were also placed to administer the courts. Later we find they abused this privilege and __<u>lost</u>__ any authority. Matt 21:12

#### Zechariah 3:7d *and I will grant you free access among these who are standing here.* The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a __<u>year</u>__. This was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. Eze 45:4

##### In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace __<u>through</u>__ the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 2:5

### Zechariah 3:8a *'Now listen, Joshua the high priest,* Zechariah was to communicate this directly to __<u>Joshua</u>__ the high priest. 

### Zechariah 3:8b *you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol,* you and your friends - friends here symbolize all the __<u>priests</u>__.

### Zechariah 3:8c *for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.* God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a truly righteous __<u>servant</u>__. Isa 11:1, 60:21, Jer 23:5, 33:15, Zech 6:12

### Zechariah 3:9a *'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua...*The high priestly uniform had 12 stones on the chest. Gen 49:24, Psa 118:22

### Zechariah 3:9b *on one stone are seven eyes...*

### Zechariah 3:9c *Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts...*

### Zechariah 3:9d *'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day...*

### Zechariah 3:10a *'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts,* *that day* refers to the day of the Lord when God will set all things straight with the nations, with Israel and establish His Kingdom. 

#### That day appears in 25 verses in Zechariah, making us understand it is an important topic in the book. 

### Zechariah 3:10b *'every one of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.'"* For each person to have a vine and at least one fig tree 

## Zechariah 4:1-14 The vision of the two olive trees.

###  This vision is continued or somehow connected with the previous vision. While Joshua is a type of Messiah from a religious perspective, Zerubbabel is a type of Messiah in a political sense. 

### Who was Zerubbabel?  

#### Heir to Davidic throne. 1 Chr 3:17-19 

##### He cannot become king because of the curse on Coniah. Jer 22:28-30, Mat 1:11-16 

##### Zerubbabel is more concerned about God's approval than his legal right. 

#### Zerubbabel was chosen as governor to lead the first return of the people (about 50 thousand) to the land. Ezr 2:2, Neh 7:7 

### Zechariah 4:1 *Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep.* Evidently Zechariah is to be wide awake to make sure he sees the following vision. 

### Zechariah 4:2 *He said to me, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it;* Zechariah is asked to describe what he sees. It is a golden lampstand with the bowl for oil on top of it. 

#### Zechariah as priest would have been familiar with the lampstand. 

### Zechariah 4:3 *also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side."* This lampstand is also different from the lampstand in the temple/tabernacle. The lampstand in the tabernacle had to have its oil replenished. This lampstand has a never ending source of oil (the two olive trees) to keep the lampstand burning. No human hands have to touch this lampstand to give forth its light. 

#### The lampstand serves as a reminder of God's presence.  

### Zechariah 4:4 *Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, "What are these, my lord?"* 

### Zechariah 4:5 *So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."* 

### Zechariah 4:6 *Then he said to me, "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts.* From Zerubbabel's perspective right now, he sees the rebuilding of the temple as an impossible task. He has the greatest obstacle of the people doing it in their own power. 

#### God declares it will be done by divine power not by Zerubbabel's power. 

### God's power able to accomplish what God asks is a constant theme in Scripture

#### Exodus 14:14 *"The LORD will fight for you while you keep silent."*

#### Psalm 46:10-11 *"Cease striving and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth." The LORD of hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our stronghold. Selah.*

### Zechariah 4:7 *'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"* The completion of the temple will come with a cry of joy! 

#### This will be a joyful response to God's power and faithfulness.  Hag 1:13, 2:4 

##### In this same way, we should be encouraged because God is with us as we walk by the Spirit. 

### Zechariah 4:8 *Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,*

### Zechariah 4:9 *"The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish it.* For Zerubbabel to know he will finish it, would be very encouraging news. 

### *Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.* The near fulfillment of this confirms the future fulfillment. 

#### Literal fulfillment of prophecy is the **only** way you can be assured the prophecy is fulfilled! Interpreting prophecy in an allegorical manner never confidently concludes knowing the Lord of hosts did it. 

### Zechariah 4:10a *"For who has despised the day of small things?* The *despised day* refers to the time when the temple was completed and some were sorrowful. Some still remembered Solomon's temple and this temple in comparison is not quite as elaborate. Hag 2:3 

#### Some could not look beyond the past and see the Messianic future by faith. 

### *Zechariah 4:10b But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—these are the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth."* Though many are disappointed, the Lord rejoiced because of the temple. 

#### Because they had returned to Him, He will return to them through the simbolism of his presence in the temple. 

### Zechariah 4:11 *Then I said to him, "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?"*

### Zechariah 4:12 *And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden oil from themselves?"*

### Zechariah 4:13 *So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."*

### Zechariah 4:14 *Then he said, "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."* 

### Who are these two? 

#### Option 1: Joshua and Zerubbabel

#### Option 2: Two offices of Messiah

### Biblical Thoughts: 

#### Light to the **gentiles** 

#### John 1 - Jesus is the light of the world - so that **all** might believe through him 

#### Exodus 19:5 - you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (manifesting the light of God to the world). 

#### Isaiah 60:1 - shine for your light has come...nations will come...

#### The Church Ephesians 5:7 - were darkness, now you are light...walk as children of light. You are light in Christ. 

##### When we walk in the reality of who we are in Christ, we reflect the light of Christ. Our responsibility is not the results but to reflect the character of Christ. (trying to learn).  

##### we are not the light source. we reflect the Light. 

##### Future manifestation of light: 

######  Rev 11:3 - two witnesses. Two olive trees. Give off light. Testimony of light during tribulation. 

## Zechariah 5:1-4 The vision of a flying scroll

### Zechariah 5:1 *Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, there was a flying scroll.*

### Zechariah 5:2 *And he said to me, "What do you see?" And I answered, "I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits."* 

#### This could be referring to the single scroll Jeremiah wrote. Jer 51:60

### Zechariah 5:3 *Then he said to me, "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side.*

### Zechariah 5:4 *"I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts,* 

#### In this particular instance, we not only see God's omniscience but his actual causing of future events. 

### Zechariah 5:4b *"and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones."* 

#### "*The thief*" here, may be referring to the commercial aspect of Babylon while "*the one who swears falsely by My name*" my refer to the religious. 

## Zechariah 5:5-11 The vision of the Ephah

### Zechariah 5:5 *Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, "Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth."*

### Zechariah 5:6 *I said, "What is it?" And he said, "This is the ephah going forth." Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land* 

#### An Ephah is a Hebrew unit of measurement for grain. Lev 5:11, Ruth 2:17

##### Perhaps it is connected here with commerce. Lev 19:36

### Zechariah 5:7 *(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah."*

### Zechariah 5:8 *Then he said, "This is Wickedness!" And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening.* The woman within the ephah is probably idolatrous Babylon that has influenced the whole world. Rev 17:1, 5, 18, Zech 5:11

### Zechariah 5:9 *Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.* 

#### The two women with wings of a stork could refer to the speed in which it is taken. 

### Zechariah 5:10 *I said to the angel who was speaking with me, "Where are they taking the ephah?"*

### Zechariah 5:11 *Then he said to me, "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal."* 

#### The land of Shinar (or Sumer) was where the first world-wide religion was, known as the tower of Babel or Babil. Gen 10:10, Gen 11:1-9 

##### Nimrod built the city of Babel right after the flood. Gen 10:10, Mic 5:2-6

##### Babel (confusion) and is also translated Babylon in Greek.  

##### Babel/Babylon is always seen in a negative light in Scripture. Jer 51:7 

##### It will ultimately be totally destroyed by God. Isa 13:1, Isa 13:19, Isa 21:9, Jer 51:11, 24, 44, Jer 50:46

##### Babylon was not destroyed like God said He would do. 1 Pet 5:13 Babylon is currently being rebuilt. 

###### At the time of this writing, the US is currently building its largest embassy ((104 acres)) in bagdad, 50 miles from Babylon. 

######  The destruction of Babylon occurs near the end of the tribulation. Rev 17-18. 

## Zechariah 6:1-15 The vision of four chariots

### Zechariah 6:1 *Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.* Deut 8:9, Zech 14:1-5 

### Zechariah 6:2 *With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses,*.. a chariot (merkabah) is a weapon of war. Merkava, Israel's main battle tank.

### Zechariah 6:3 *with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses.* 

#### Revelation 6 mentions the same colours in a different order.  John would have thought of this vision possibly.  

##### White horse - victory 

##### Red Horse - bloodshed of war 

##### Black horse - economic disaster 

##### Ashen horse - caos, death, instability

### Zechariah 6:4 *Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, "What are these, my lord?"*

### Zechariah 6:5 *The angel replied to me, "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth,* Josh 3:11, 13, Mic 4:13 

### Zechariah 6:6 *with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country.* The red horses aren't going anywhere. It would appear that war is made from Jerusalem where Messiah comes. 

### Zechariah 6:7 *"When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth." And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth.* They are eager to go appease God's wrath specifically in the land of the north. 

### Zechariah 6:8 *Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north."*

### Zechariah 6:9 *The word of the LORD also came to me, saying,*

### Zechariah 6:10 *"Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.* These men may be metal smiths. 

### Zechariah 6:11 *"Take silver and gold, make an ornate crown and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.* 

### Zechariah 6:12 *"Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD.* Messiah will do this. 

### Zechariah 6:13 *"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."'*

### Zechariah 6:14 *"Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah.*

### Zechariah 6:15 *"Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD." Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God.* 

## Zechariah 7-8 - Message #3 - Special Instructions

### Zechariah 7:8 *Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,*

### Zechariah 7:9 *"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother;*

### Zechariah 7:11 *"But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.*

### Zechariah 7:12 *"They made their hearts like flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts.*

### Zechariah 7:13 *"And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts;*

### Zechariah 7:14 *"but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate."*

### Zechariah 8:6 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts.*

### Zechariah 8:7 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west;*

### Zechariah 8:8 *and I will bring them back and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.'*

### Zechariah 8:9 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, those who spoke in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built.*

### Zechariah 8:10 *'For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another.*

### Zechariah 8:11 *'But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts.*

### Zechariah 8:12 'For *there will be* peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these *things.*

### Zechariah 8:13 *'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.'*

### Zechariah 8:14 *"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented,*

### Zechariah 8:15 *so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!*

### Zechariah 8:16 *'These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates.*

### Zechariah 8:17 *'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD."*

### Zechariah 8:18 *Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,*

### Zechariah 8:19 *"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth months will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.'*

### Zechariah 8:21 *'The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go."*

### Zechariah 8:22 *'So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.'*

## Zechariah 9 -14 - Message #4 - 2 Burdens

### Zechariah 9:1 *The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD),*

### Zechariah 9:2 *And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise.*

### Zechariah 9:3 *For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets.*

### Zechariah 9:4 *Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire.*

### Zechariah 9:5 *Ashkelon will see it and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.*

### Zechariah 9:6 *And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.*

### Zechariah 9:7 *And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite.*

### Zechariah 9:8 *But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes.*

### Zechariah 9:9 *Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.*

### Zechariah 9:10 *I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.*

### Zechariah 9:11 *As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.*

### Zechariah 9:12 *Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.*

### Zechariah 9:13 *For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior's sword.*

### Zechariah 9:14 *Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south.*

### Zechariah 9:15 *The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink andbe boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a sacrificialbasin, Drenched like the corners of the altar.*

### Zechariah 9:16 *And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they are as the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land.*

### Zechariah 9:17 *For what comeliness and beauty will be theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins.*

### Zechariah 10:1 *Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to each man.*

### Zechariah 10:2 *For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore the people wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.*

### Zechariah 10:3 *"My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle.*

### Zechariah 10:4 *"From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, allof them together.*

### Zechariah 10:5 *"They will be as mighty men, Treading down the enemyin the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD will be with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame.*

### Zechariah 10:6 *"I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them.*

### Zechariah 10:7 *"Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if from wine; Indeed, their children will see it and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD.*

### Zechariah 10:8 *"I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before.*

### Zechariah 10:9 *"When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back.*

### Zechariah 10:10 *"I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no room can be found for them.*

### Zechariah 10:11 *"And they will pass through the sea of distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart.*

### Zechariah 10:12 *"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD.*

### Zechariah 11:1 *Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars.*

### Zechariah 11:2 *Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious trees have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down.*

### Zechariah 11:3 *There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.*

### Zechariah 11:4 *Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock doomedto slaughter.*

### Zechariah 11:5 *"Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and each of those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them.*

### Zechariah 11:6 *"For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their power."*

### Zechariah 11:7 *So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock.*

### Zechariah 11:8 *Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me.*

### Zechariah 11:9 *Then I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh."*

### Zechariah 11:10 *I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.*

### Zechariah 11:11 *So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD.*

### Zechariah 11:12 *I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.*

### Zechariah 11:13 *Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter, thatmagnificent price at which I was valued by them." So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD.*

### Zechariah 11:14 *Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.*

### Zechariah 11:15 *The LORD said to me, "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.*

### Zechariah 11:16 *"For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.*

### Zechariah 11:17 *"Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind."*

### Zechariah 12:1 *The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. Thus declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him,*

### Zechariah 12:2 *"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah.*

### Zechariah 12:3 *"It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it.*

### Zechariah 12:4 *"In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness.*

### Zechariah 12:5 *"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.'*

### Zechariah 12:6 *"In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem.*

### Zechariah 12:7 *"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah.*

### Zechariah 12:8 *"In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the LORD before them.*

### Zechariah 12:9 *"And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.*

### Zechariah 12:10 *"I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn.*

### Zechariah 12:11 *"In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo.*

### Zechariah 12:12 *"The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;*

### Zechariah 12:13 *the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves;*

### Zechariah 12:14 *all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves.*

### Zechariah 13:1 *"In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.*

### Zechariah 13:2 *"It will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land.*

### Zechariah 13:3 *"And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies.*

### Zechariah 13:4 *"Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive;*

### Zechariah 13:5 *but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.'*

### Zechariah 13:6 *"And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say, 'Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.'*

### Zechariah 13:7 *"Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones.*

### Zechariah 13:8 *"It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off and perish; But the third will be left in it.*

### Zechariah 13:9 *"And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'"*

### Zechariah 14:1 *Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.*

### Zechariah 14:2 *For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.*

### Zechariah 14:3 *Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.*

### Zechariah 14:4 *In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south.*

### Zechariah 14:5 *You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, and all the holy ones with Him!*

### Zechariah 14:6 *In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.*

### Zechariah 14:7 *For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light.*

### Zechariah 14:8 *And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter.*

### Zechariah 14:9 *And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.*

### Zechariah 14:10 *All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses.*

### Zechariah 14:11 *People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.*

### Zechariah 14:12 *Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth.*

### Zechariah 14:13 *It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another.*

### Zechariah 14:14 *Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance.*

### Zechariah 14:15 *So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps.*

### Zechariah 14:16 *Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.*

### Zechariah 14:17 *And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them.*

### Zechariah 14:18 *If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no rain will fall on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.*

### Zechariah 14:19 *This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths.*

### Zechariah 14:20 *In that day there will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD." And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar.*

### Zechariah 14:21 *Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.*
