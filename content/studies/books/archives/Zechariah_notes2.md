### C. Why study the book of Zechariah? 

• It reveals behind the scenes Spiritual warfare 

• It reveals Israel's future kingdom and the nations under it.

• Because God remembers his promises (Meaning of Zechariah). 

• It is because of the prophecy of this book and teh book of Haggai that the temple was rebuilt. Ezra 4:5

After 70 years God raised up a man named Cyrus to open the door to Juda's return to the land (Ezra 1:2-4). This return happened in three waves. The first wave was led by a man named Zerubabel. This first return is the time at which the prophecy of Zechariah is given. 
Upon Juda's return to Jerusalem they first rebuilt the altar of the Lord and reestablished sacrifices (Ezra 3:1-6). Also, the Temple was to be rebuilt with donations of material and money (Ezra 3:1–7) but up to the point where Zechariah's prophecy begins, only the foundation has been laid (Ezra 3:8-13, 5:16). Opposition from the Samaritans has delayed the work about 18 years.

## II. Zechariah 1:1-6 - Message #1 - God's call to return

### Zechariah 1:1 *In the eighth month of the second year of Darius,…* `Cyrus was the first Persian king to allow Judah to return. After about 15 years, Darius I, the persian succeeded Cyrus and reigned from 29 September 522 B.C. to October 486 B.C. This places the writing of Zechariah in 520 B.C.. `
`Most likely Scripture dates the writing of the book in reference to a Gentile king because Daniel's "times of the Gentiles" is now underway. No Jewish king is reigning. Jerusalem is being trampled underfoot of Gentile nations. Daniel 9:24-27, Luke 21:24`

### Zechariah 1:1 the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet,…*  `Zechariah is a young prophet. He never saw the first temple as he was a baby when he come from Babylon. Some scholars ascribe Psalm 137 and 138 to Zechariah.`

#### 1. What Zechariah spoke is not of his own initiative or deduction. It was God's __<u>word</u>__. Heb 1:1, 2 Tim 3:16-17

#### 2. Haggai prophesied in September, October and December but __<u>nothing</u>__ in November. Zechariah's prophecy was in November.

#### 3. Zerubbabel listened and followed what __<u>God</u>__ commanded. Ezra 5:2

#### 4. Even though there was opposition, God told the people to begin rebuilding the temple. The opposition remained __<u>quiet</u>__ until hearing back from king Darius I regarding the authenticity of the decree issued by Cyrus. Ezra 5:5

### Zechariah 1:1 the son of Berechiah, …*  `evidently Zechariah's father. Perhaps he died young as he is not mentioned in Ezra.`

#### not much is told to us about Berechiah except he was the __<u>father</u>__ of Zechariah. 

#### Jesus mentioned a martyred prophet called Zechariah **son of Berechiah** in  Matthew 23:35. Luke also mentions this but __<u>leaves</u>__ Berechiah's name out. Luk 11:51

#### It's difficult to know why it is stated this way in Matthew since we don't know how Zechariah dies and there is another Zechariah (son of Jehoiada) who was a prophet that had lived __<u>300</u>__ years earlier that was killed by the people. 2 Chr. 24:20-22

##### Option 1: Berechiah means essentially the same as Jehoiada. Since they mean the __<u>same</u>__, the names were used interchangeably by Jesus

##### Option 2: Both Zechariah's may have had fathers __<u>named</u>__ Berechias and that Jehoiada was actually Zechariah's grandfather. 

##### Option 3: An __<u>error</u>__ in transcription 

##### Option 4: Jesus witnessed Zechariah son of Berechiah's __<u>murder</u>__ just the same as he did Abel's. This seems the most plausible option of the 4. 

##### 		Matthew was also familiar with Zechariah since he quotes it three times. It would have caught his attention to hear Jesus __<u>state</u>__ it. 

### Zechariah 1:1 the son of Iddo `Iddo is Zechariah's grandfather. He is listed among the priests who returned from Babylon. Nehemiah 12:1, 4`

#### Iddo, was Zechariah's grandfather. He was a priest. Iddo is __<u>listed</u>__ among those who returned from Babylon.  Neh 12:1-4 	

#### Zechariah was a __<u>prophet</u>__. This was his roll. 

### Zechariah 1:1 saying, "The LORD was very angry with your fathers. `the fathers are those who were deported to Babylon. 2 Chr 36`

### Zechariah 1:1 "Therefore say to them, `(the people who have returned)`

### Zechariah 1:1 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, Zechariah was to speak the Lord of hosts' __<u>word</u>__ to the people, this would include the few older generation that returned, the young and Zerubbabel and Joshua. 

### `THE LORD OF HOSTS: `

##### `The LORD of Hosts is mentioned 52 times in Zechariah. This is an important key to understanding Zechariah's message.`

#### `THE LORD OF HOST IS COMMANDER OF ARMIES`

##### `(Heb: Yahweh Sabaoth Tza-va (צבא) or Almighty of armies used 235 times in the Bible). `
##### `Tza-va (צבא) is the word for army – and what today refers to the Israeli Defence Force. Tza-va-ot (צבאות) is the plural. Multiple armies of which are included the angelic beings.` 

##### `Isaiah 13:4  A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. Isaiah 1:9, 2 Kings 6:15-16`

##### `Isaiah 19:16 ...they will tremble and be in dread because of the waving of the hand of the LORD of hosts...You, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, Awake to punish all the nations; Do not be gracious to any who are treacherous in iniquity. Selah. Isaiah 1:24, Isaiah 2:12, Isaiah 5:7 `

##### `Nahum 2:13  "Behold, I am against you," declares the LORD of hosts. "I will burn up her chariots in smoke, a sword will devour your young lions; I will cut off your prey from the land, and no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard." Isaiah 1:24, Malachi 4:1-3, Psalm 103:20-21, Matt 13:41, Mattew 24:30-31, Revelation 19:11-20`

#### `THE LORD OF HOSTS IS KING:`

##### `Psalm 24:10 Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory! Selah` 

##### `Isaiah 9:7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, On the throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will accomplish this. `

##### `Zechariah 14:9 And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one.'`

##### `1 Kings 22:19  Micaiah said, "Therefore, hear the word of the LORD. I saw the LORD sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right and on His left. His hosts are many.

##### `Isaiah 28:5  In that day the LORD of hosts will become a beautiful crown And a glorious diadem to the remnant of His people; 2 Kings 6:17, Isaiah 29:6, Isaiah 13:14`

#### `THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE REDEEMER:`

##### `Isaiah 47:4 Our Redeemer, the LORD of HOSTS is His NAME, the Holy One of Israel.`

##### `Isaiah 44:6 "Thus says the LORD, the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts: 'I am the first and I am the last, And there is no God besides Me. Jeremiah 50:34, Malachi 3:17, Zechariah 14:16, Isaiah 44:6, Revelation 22:13, Psalm 59:5`

##### `Psalm 84:1-12 ....How blessed is the man who trusts in You!`

#### `THE LORD OF HOSTS IS HOLY: `

##### `Isaiah 6:3 "Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD (Jehovah) of hosts, the whole earth is full of His glory." Jeremiah 32:18 , Isaiah 8:14. Jeremiah 11:20, Isaiah 5:16`

#### `THE LORD OF HOSTS IS SOVEREIGN: `

##### `"All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the HOST of HEAVEN & among the inhabitants of earth & no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, 'What have You done?" Daniel 4:35`	

##### `Hannah is the first person to mention this name, asking the Lord of Hosts to give her a son. 1 Samuel 1`

##### `David invokes the Lord of Hosts when going before Goliath. 1 Samuel 17:45, 2 Samuel 5:10`

##### `David became greater and greater, for the LORD God of hosts was with him. 1 Chronicles 11:9, 2 Samuel 6:18, 2 Samuel 7:27`  

### `WHAT ARE THE HOSTS?`

##### `Genesis 2:1 mentions the hosts being created. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 

##### `Nehemiah 9:6 “You are the Lord, you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host.” . and all the host them, of the heavens and the earth; the host of heavens are the sun, moon, and stars, often so called in Scripture, and also the angels; `

#### `ANGELS:`

##### `Luke 2:13 And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,, Acts 7:42, Psa 33:6, Isaiah 37:16`

>A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing; 
Our helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and pow'r are great, and, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;
**Lord Sabaoth is his name**, from age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

>And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us;
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

>That word above all earthly pow'rs, no thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him Who with us sideth;
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.  
(Martin Luther)`

##### Eventually Christ, when He reigns on the earth will take on the name Lord of hosts. Zech 14:16-17

##### Zechariah's message comes from the Lord of hosts himself. This is __<u>crucial</u>__ to see the importance of his message. Thankfully governor Zerubbabel and Joshua the priest didn't question the source of Zechariah's message. Ultimately the temple will be rebuilt under Zerubbabel.

### Zechariah 1:1 "Return to Me," `While Haggai is more focused on the return to the land and the rebuilding of the temple, Zechariah's message is to encourage the people to return to a right relationship with God. In order to do so, God will reveal the person of Jesus Christ. The book of Zechariah will present Christ as: The angel of the Lord, The man, The Branch, The Shepherd, The king, The Redeemer, The humble Servant and finally, The Lord of Hosts.`

The opposite of return is to __<u>forsake</u>__. They had forsaken the Lord of hosts and needed to return. The result would be God's returning to them as the Lord of hosts to defend and fight for His nation. 

### Zechariah 1:1 declares the LORD of hosts, `The Lord of hosts declares Israel to return, not merely to the land but to himself. One might think this call is unnecessary. They are back in the land, they have rebuilt the altar and laid the foundation for the temple. It's appears as though things are going well apart from the opposition from the Samaritans. Perhaps Zechariah's message should be rather, rebuild the temple no matter the obstacles, just get it done! Yet, God is saying that in order for things to be good with Him, they must first of all return to Him by faith. This, perhaps was totally overlooked and presumed due to the current circumstances. SO, when a little trial comes their way, they are found discouraged. Instead of where they ought to have been, simple trusting the Lord of hosts to battle for them to get done what He had commanded. Haggai 1:9-11`

### Zechariah 1:1 "that I may return to you," 

### Zechariah 1:1 says the LORD of hosts. `It is a great thing to have the Lord of hosts with you. The rebuilding of the temple symbolized God's presence among the people. Haggai's prophecy is to return to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. Here God is telling Israel to return to a relationship with Him, not mere ritual or externals, but a return of heart back to the Lord of Hosts.`

### Zechariah 1:1 "Do not be like your fathers, `2 Chr 30:7`

### Zechariah 1:1 to whom the former prophets proclaimed, 

### Zechariah 1:1 saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 

### Zechariah 1:1 "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."' 

### Zechariah 1:1 But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD. 

#### Evil ways and evil deeds are demonstrable yet a return to God is not merely about ceasing to do evil __<u>things</u>__ but a return to fellowship. 

##### A __<u>return</u>__ to God is the condition of the heart (internal). The changed ways are the result (external). 

#### God invites Judah into a relationship, not mere external, religious __<u>rote</u>__. Zechariah 7:4-6, Zechariah 8:2, Amos 5:21-27,  Colossians 2:23 

#### God hates religious rote as a replacement for a __<u>relationship</u>__. Isaiah 1:12-14, Jeremiah 4:4

##### It is counted as violence to the law. Ezekiel 22:26, Zephaniah 3:4

##### In Acts 17:22 Paul says these words about the Athenians on Mars Hill. *So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects*. 

##### An old commentator rephrased __<u>Paul's</u>__ words,  *I perceive that in all things yo are too superstitious*. Jer 10:2, Act 28:3-4, Act 17:23

### Zechariah 1:1 "Your fathers, where are they? `The fathers had been killed by the Babylonians and died or remained in Babylon. Psa 90:10`

### Zechariah 1:1 And the prophets, do they live forever? `Some prophets were killed by the very people they prophecied to. `

#### God had spoken to them then. They should have listened and returned. In a similar fashion today, God's offer of  __<u>salvatión</u>__ is today, not necessarily tomorrow. Jer 26:5, 2 Cor 6:2

### Zechariah 1:1 "But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, 

### Zechariah 1:1 overtake your fathers? `Though people want to shut the prophets up, God sees it all and is patient with the people and still sends more prophets. 2 Chronicles 24:20-21, Matt 23:35 God's commands are still the same, even today`

### Zechariah 1:1 Then they repented and said, `the word for repent (SHUB) is better translated here returned as it's referring to a physical return from Babylon to the promised land. Compare the use of __<u>SHUB</u>__ in Zec 1:3 with Zec 1:6` 

### Zechariah 1:1 As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, 

### Zechariah 1:1 so He has dealt with us.'"'" `Scripture states that 42,360 people returned to Judah, accompanied by 7,337 slaves and two hundred singers (Ezra 2:64–65), including members of the ten northern tribes taken into captivity by Assyria in 722 B.C. (Ezra 2:70). Though these returned physically, overall, they did not turn to God. Jer 7:4  "Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, 'This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.' Jer 7:8`

### `A NOTE ABOUT REPENTANCE: The word repentance in the Bible is used in different ways and it has caused a lot of confusion, especially regarding the correct response to the Gospel. In 1384, John Wycliffe produced the first hand written English Bible. Wycliffe used Jersome's Latin Bible as his sole source, which unfortunately had several grave mistranslations. One such mistranslation was the Greek word METANOIA (to change one's thinking or perspective) to a word which means to do acts of penance, to be penitent. The first English Bible had a tremendous influence on the English language and the term repentance (feel sorry, be penitent) replaced the original metanoia (change your mind). We can understand then why the Hebrew word SHUB (to turn back, return) here is translated to repent when it was much clearer to translate it, 'return'. Physically they returned yet spiritually they did not. `

#### `They simply accepted being wrong and that God would have to punish them.  This is the wrong attitude to have. Confession of sin has no judiciary value before God unless it first is brought by a turning by faith to God. Sin must be paid for not merely recognized. That is why Christ came and died on a cross. His death is the payment for sin not merely the pronouncement of sin. When a person turns to God, it is by faith that the person of Christ has paid fully for his sin debt and no other means or work is necessary to be right with God. Israel needed to come to God by faith, not merely saying they did wrong and accepting God's punishment.`

#### The previous generation recognized their error but never changed their way of __<u>thinking</u>__, they simply accepted their punishment saying God did as He said.  Ezekiel 20:43 

#### A short note about __<u>biblical</u>__ repentance: 

##### It's not merely recognizing the __<u>wrong</u>__ you have done. It's not a focus on the admission of guilt. Matthew 27:3-5

##### It's not feeling __<u>sorrow</u>__ for something (even though that is the contemporary meaning in the dictionary). Biblical Repentance and regret are not synonymous words. 

##### 		It is true that God's kindness or godly sorrow may lead to repentance but they are not one in the same thing. Romans 2:4, 2 Corinthians 7:9

##### It's not ceasing from __<u>sin</u>__, promising not to sin or changing one's life from sin. It may help to realize the phrase "repent of your sins" is not found in the Bible. Acts 2:38 says "*repent **for** the forgiveness of sins*" which clearly shows sins being forgiven as a promised result of repentance.  

##### It's not something you __<u>measure</u>__ to see if it is real, true or authentic repentance.  This is a common misconception that plagues Christianity today.  The root is repentance which is internal. The results could be outward and might be seen differently in each case but not that they are required by God for the internal to be authentic.  Luke 3:8-18, 

##### Biblical repentance is changing one's __<u>mind</u>__  towards God, you change your thinking regarding what you are trusting in to trust God. Acts 20:21, Acts 11:18, Isaiah 1:18, Hebrews 6:1

##### 		For instance, in the case of an unbeliever, to change ones mind about God's offer made through the __<u>Gospel</u>__ (that Christ died paying for our sins and rising again) and believe it. Luke 24:45-47, Acts 19:4, Luke 13:1-5

##### 		Or for a believer in error should __<u>repent</u>__ (change his or her thinking) towards God regarding walking according to the flesh or sinful lifestyle for instance. Revelation 2:21, 3:3, 3:19, 1 John 1:9, Romans 6:1-11, Romans 8:12-13, Galatians 5:16

`The purpose of this message was because God was warning the returning Jews from Babylon that the reason their fathers were sent away in the first place was because they did not listen and trust Him. `

`Isaiah 29:13-16 Then the Lord said, "Because this people draw near with their words And honor Me with their lip service, But they remove their hearts far from Me, And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned *by rote,* Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous; And the wisdom of their wise men will perish, And the discernment of their discerning men will be concealed." Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the LORD, And whose deeds are *done* in a dark place, And they say, "Who sees us?" or "Who knows us?" You turn *things* around! Shall the potter be considered as equal with the clay, That what is made would say to its maker, "He did not make me"; Or what is formed say to him who formed it, "He has no understanding"?`

`God wanted this generation to not make the same mistake as their fathers. They could be deceived into thinking that because they were returning to the land, their punishment had purged them clean and had made them right with God. They would be prone to think the blessing of their return was a demonstration that God was pleased with them. God had sent them away from the land 70 years so that they would change their minds and walk with Him by faith.`

`"Return to me and I will return to you" - God`

`“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you”. (James 4:8 nkjv) `

## III. Message #2 - Eight Visions



| Vision                        | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** **Horseman**            | (1:7-17): Jerusalem and the temple will be rebuilt. The nations watched |
| **2** **Horns and craftsmen** | (1:18-21): The four empires will be terrified by four craftsmen |
| **3** **Measuring Jerusalem** | (2:1-13): Jerusalem measured=restored                        |
| **4** **High Priest**         | (3:1-10): Judah rejects God, yet ultimately God will restore them |
| **5** **Olive Trees**         | (4:1-14): God empowers his people through His Spirit         |
| **6** **The Flying Scroll**   | (5:1-4):                                                     |
| **7** **The Ephah**           | (5:5-11):                                                    |
| **8** **Four Chariots**       | (6:1-15): Gentiles judged / Christ's reign                   |

On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, `There are no Hebrew names given for months. Moses gave the law to the second generation on the first day of the 11th month. Deut 1:3`
	
which is the month Shebat, `Shebat is the aquired Babylonian name for the eleventh month. This is the time of year when winter is on its way out in Israel.  `

in the second year of Darius, 

the word of the LORD came 

to Zechariah 
the prophet, 
the son of Berechiah, 
the son of Iddo, `this is three months after receiving the first message. This time, Zechariah received a message from the Lord in the form of eight visions in one night.`

Once again Zechariah gives his ancestry. Zechariah was from a priestly line serving as a prophet. It appears this is was a separate writing that included an introduction and was later compiled together to form all of Zechariah's prophecies.

### The man on the Red Horse

as follows: 

I saw at night, `Zechariah received this message in a vision at night. This was not a dream. He literally saw these things and describes what he saw in terms he and his audience understood.`

Zechariah 1:8a  *I saw at night...* This is not a __<u>dream</u>__, it is a __vision__, he received while awake at night. Visions were received while awake and dreams are revelations while asleep. This was how God communicated to the Prophets. Num 12:6

and behold, 
a man was riding `In verse 11 we are told this man is the angel of the Lord.`

on a red horse, `generally speaking red symbolizes blood as a result of war. This rider may have been riding in battle. Zechariah states it is a man, not an angelic being. This man is none other than Jesus Christ. Revelation 6:4, Rev 19:19-21`

#### Horses back then were the fastest form of travel. Horses are often seen in contexts dealing with war.

#### The color red is often associated with blood and or war. 

#### The angel of the Lord is ready to make war.  

#### In Revelation 19:11 we see Christ riding a white horse signifying his purpose to conquer.

and he was standing 
among the myrtle trees `The rider on the red horse was riding but is now standing among the myrtle trees. He is no longer riding but standing under the shade of myrtle trees. `

`Nehemiah 8:15 implies that myrtle trees possibly grew in or near Jerusalem. They are certainly all through modern Palestine. Most pictures of myrtle trees show it as a shrub about 8-10 feet tall but given the right conditions and with plenty of water, it grows to a considerable size. Myrtle trees are seen as a good thing in Hebrew culture. In fact Esther's Hebrew name (Hadassah) is myrtle in Hebrew. Esther 2:7 `

`The pomegranate is also in the myrtle family`

### Interestingly, myrtle trees are mentioned in other passages when God says he will turn the wilderness to blossom. Isa 41:19

#### In the fulfillment of the eternal covenant or New Covenant to Israel, God will turn briars into myrtle trees. This will be for the glory of the Lord. Isa 55:13

which were in the ravine, `Jer 7:30-34  "For the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight," declares the LORD, "they have set their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. "They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind. "Therefore, behold, days are coming," declares the LORD, "when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place. "The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the beasts of the earth; and no one will frighten them away."Then I will make to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a ruin.Nehemiah, Isaiah and Zechariah mention myrtle trees. Nehemiah mentions myrtle branches during the celebration of the feast of tabernacles/booths. Isaiah states that during the milenial reign when everything is restored, God will turn briars (result of man's sin) into myrtle trees. Isaiah 41:19, Isaiah 55:13,`

with red, 
sorrel 
and white 
horses behind him. `Red, sorrel and white horses behind him`
Then I said, 
"My lord, what are these?" `Zechariah wants to know the significance of what he saw. `
And the angel 
who was speaking with me 
said to me, 
"I will show you what these are." `It is not the receptor's task to interpret some mysterious dream. The explanation of the vision is given so that Zechariah knows what God wants to communicate. Rev 1:1`
And the man 
who was standing 
among the myrtle trees 
				answered and said, `the man on the red horse himself explains...`
							"These are those 
								whom the LORD has sent 
								to patrol the earth." `This is most likely something that is constantly going on. We know from Job 1:6-7 that Satan also roams to and fro over the earth. This angel patrol also roams over the earth. These agents are sent by God to observe and report back to Him. Zechariah 6:7 `
		

So they answered the angel of the LORD `The term, THE ANGEL OF THE LORD can be seen 6 times in Zechariah. This “*man among the myrtle trees*” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), Many scholars believe this to be the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times makes temporary appearances on earth. The angel of the Lord appeared to Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), Abraham (18; 22:11–18), Jacob (31:11, 13), Moses (Ex. 3), Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23) and Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).`
					

who was standing 
							among the myrtle trees 
		and said, 
					"We have patrolled the earth, 
					

and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet." `To the reader the initial thought might be, "Peace! All is well!". The response by the angel of the Lord reflects things are far from right in order to be at peace. There's nothing wrong with peace as long as it is attained the right way. The nations were at peace at the expense of God's nation Israel. God has no regard for man's way of peace apart from Him. True, ultimate world peace will only be attained when Jesus Christ rules from his throne in Israel. Isa 9:6-7, Isa 2:4 Peace does not come until Babylon is destroyed. Rev 17-18, Zech 5`

Then the angel of the LORD said, 					

"O LORD of hosts, 
							how long will You have no compassion 
									for Jerusalem 
									and the cities of Judah, 

 `The angel of the Lord requests the Lord of hosts for compassion. For centuries, “*How long?*” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Psa 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “*How long?*” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven. Rev. 6:10 Yet God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish. 2 Peter 3:9 `

​											with which You have been indignant 
​											these seventy years?"

`God had said the time would be 70 years. The angel of the Lord essentially asks God what the people are thinking, "how much longer are your people to suffer?" Jer 29:10. The reader is reminded of the time God had set of 70 years to return to the land, yet about 17 extra years had passed and still "*the earth is peaceful and quiet*" and no temple has been erected.  Jer 29:10. The angel of the Lord's words reflect his concern for the people and his indignation at the injustice shown to Judah and all the while the nations are "*at peace*".  It is only for the Lord, God the Father to know the times and the epochs of things. Act 1:7. It was told to Daniel that ultimately it would be 70 units of 7. This comes to a total of 490 years that yet have to be fulfilled in their purpose. Dan 9:24-27`



​				The LORD answered the angel 
​							who was speaking with me 
​				with gracious words, 
​				comforting words. `The sovereign Lord of the universe is not feigned with the "accusation" and responds with kind words. Col 4:6`

​			So the angel 
​					who was speaking with me 
​			said to me, 
​				"Proclaim, saying, 

### `This message is not to be kept hidden it is to be announced. As a prophet Zechariah's task is not to receive the message for himself but to relate to the people. Heb 1:1-2 This is in direct response to the intercessory request made by the angel of the Lord. Zech 1:12`

​						'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
​								"I am exceedingly jealous 

`The Lord kindly responds "I am jealous for Jerusalem and Zion!" God has a strong devotion towards Israel.  Isa 54:8, Heb 12:6-7 This would have been an important reminder to the people during this time where it could seem God had somehow forgotten his promises to Israel. `

​											for Jerusalem and Zion. `Many times in Scripture we see how Zion is synonimous with Jerusalem. Yet here they shown distinct. Zion is the mountain on which Messiah's throne will be established in the city of Jerusalem. Psa 2:6. Zion is the mountain on which God's house, the temple, stands. Mic 3:12. Zion serves as a reminder to the people of what God will ultimately do in setting up His kingdom and rule over the nations. Mic 4:1, 3. Zion will be the place where God will impart his knowledge and glory to the nations. Mic 4:2`



##### 								"But I am very angry 
​								with the nations 
​											who are at ease; 
​										for while I was only a little angry, 
​										they furthered the disaster." 

`peace is a good thing but not at the cost of injustice. Israel is not in her land, she has been disbursed. Here the angel of the Lord is calling out for justice.`

`The Lord had said this would happen and had even promised to punish them (specifically in this case the Chaldeans) for their harsh treatment of the Jews. Gen 12:3, Jer 51:24, 34-35, Amo 6:1 `

​											'Therefore thus says the LORD, 
​												"I will return to Jerusalem 
​															with compassion; 
​														My house will be built in it," `rebuilding of temple is foretold here`
​															declares the LORD of hosts, 
​															"and a measuring line 
​															will be stretched 
​															over Jerusalem."' `rebuilding of Jerusalem is foretold here. This must have been encouraging especially while seeing a city in ruins.`

`We can be confident that whatever is about to be said is to provide comfort. About 200 years earlier, God had announced through the prophet Isaiah that He would do this....*"It is I who says of Cyrus, 'He is My shepherd! And he will perform all My desire.' And he declares of Jerusalem, 'She will be built,' And of the temple, 'Your foundation will be laid.'"* Isa 44:28. Zechariah adds to Isaiah's prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10 `

#### Zechariah adds to Isaiah's prophecy that under Zerubbabel, the temple will be rebuilt. Zech 4:9-10 												"Again, proclaim, saying, 
​															'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
​																	"My cities will again overflow 
​																	with prosperity, 
​																	and the LORD will again 
​																		comfort Zion 
​																		and again choose Jerusalem."'" 

### `The Lord of hosts (He who battles for them) is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, with a special emphasis on Zion and Jerusalem. Zech 6:15 `

#### `While the prophecy of verse 16 seems connected to Zechariah's time, verse 17 is clearly yet future. `

#### `Prophecy is given by God in a way that when it is fulfilled "*...you will know that I am the Lord*" Ex 6:7`

##### `When God forgives the nation of Israel for their sins and they are reestablished in a right relationship with Him. Zech 13:9`

##### `When God will make the people settle in the land and they become fruitful and prosperous. Eze 36:11`

##### `When God will show himself holy through Israel before the eyes of the nations. Eze 36:23`

##### `When God will rebuild what was destroyed and replants what was desolate. Eze 36:36.`

##### `When God will fill the rebuilt cities with people. Eze 36:38.`

##### `When God will bring back to life a people long dead. Eze 37:6.`

##### `When God will open their graves and bring his people up from them. Eze 37:13`

##### `When God will put his spirit in them and settle them in their own land. Eze 37:14`

##### `When God's sanctuary will stand among them forever. Eze 37:28`

##### `When God defeats the Gog Magog coalition. Eze 38:23`

##### `When God finishes calling his people back to Israel, not leaving any behind. Eze 39:28`

### Four Horns & Four Craftsmen

`God's anger at the nations and his mercy on Israel. Isaiah 47:6, 11`

Then I lifted up my eyes 
and looked, and behold, 
*there were* four horns. `Horns used this way, typically represent earthly powers, leaders or nations. Psa 75:10, Dan 7-8, Rev 12-13, 17`

​	So I said to the angel 
​			who was speaking with me, 
​		"What are these?" 
​		And he answered me, 
​				"These are the horns 
​						which have scattered 
​						Judah, 
​						Israel 
​						and Jerusalem." `This may be referring to a future time. It speaks of four horns (gentile nations) that already had scattered Judah.  `

#### `Option 1 (past): The four horns had already come. Perhaps this refers to the four nations (Caldeans, Syrians, Moabites and Amonites)  mentioned in 2 Kings 24:2 that God used to scatter Judah. `

#### `Option 2 (future): The four horns are not yet completed. Assyria is stated as being the first to scatter, then Babylon and Medo Persia were guilty of this so the fourth was yet to come, referring to Rome. Jer 50:17-18, Eze 34:11-24 `

Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. 
	I said, "What are these coming to do?" 
	And he said, 
		"These are the horns 
				which have scattered Judah 
				so that no man lifts up his head; 
		but these *craftsmen* have come 
			to terrify them, 
			to throw down 
			the horns of the nations 
						who have lifted up *their* horns 
							against the land of Judah 
								in order to scatter it." `Even though the horns would scatter Judah, God told Zechariah of four craftsmen who would terrify them and throw them down. This served to encourage the reader that though things seemed helpless, they could place their hope and trust in the Lord who would ultimately have the last word. `

#### Then I lifted up my eyes 
	and looked, 
	and behold, 
*there was* a man 
		with a measuring line in his hand. `Zechariah saw a man who had an instrument to measure in his hand.`
So I said, 
	"Where are you going?" `Zechariah was puzzled as to where the man was going. It may be because the current city of Jerusalem and it's borders were unclear and was was actually there was a barren land since it had been demolished. `
And he said to me, 
	"To measure Jerusalem, 
		to see how wide it is 
		and how long it is." 
And behold, the angel 
		who was speaking with me 
		was going out, 
	and another angel 
	was coming out to meet him, `Now Zechariah sees the interpreting angel heading out to meet another angel. `
	and said to him, 
			"Run, speak to that young man, 
				saying, `God commands urgency in communicating this message to Zechariah. He tells the angel to *run*!  Knowing that one day Jerusalem will be filled with multitudes of men and cattle would have been of great encouragement! This would indeed promote the rebuilding of the temple.`						

#### 'Jerusalem will be inhabited 
								without walls 
								because of the multitude of men 
								and cattle within it. 
	      'For I,' 
	            declares the LORD, 
	      'will be a wall of fire around her, `God himself will be the protecting wall around the city.`
	        and I will be the glory 
	          in her midst.'"  
	      "Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," 
	            declares the LORD, 
	          "for I have dispersed you 
	                as the four winds of the heavens," 
	                    declares the LORD. 
	      "Ho, Zion! 
	          Escape, 
	            you who are living with the daughter of Babylon." `Babylon is to the east of Jerusalem. The two religious entities are contrasted. Zion and daughter of Babylon.  The daughter of Babylon refers to the Chaldean system of religion. Isa 47, Psa 137:8, Rev 17 This is one and the same with the religious system started in Babel. Rev 17:5`                   

####  For thus says the LORD of hosts, 
"After glory He has sent me 
against the nations 
which plunder you, 
for he who touches you, 
touches the apple of His eye. `God is jealous over His possession, Israel. He who touches it, goes up against the very Lord of hosts! Deut 32:9-10`
                          "For behold, 
                              I will wave My hand over them 
                                so that they will be plunder 
                                for their slaves. `The nations plan and work against God, yet God will ultimately *shatter them like earthenware* and give the nations as an inheritance to His Son. Psa 2`
                 Then you will know 
                   that the LORD of hosts 
                  	has sent Me. 
                      "Sing for joy and be glad, 
                        O daughter of Zion; `Here the daughter of Zion is placed in contrast to the daughter of Babylon. Ultimately God will triumph over the system of man. What an important prophecy for Judah to hold on to at a time of desperation. Zech 9:9`

#### for behold I am coming 
and I will dwell in your midst," 
declares the LORD. 
"Many nations will join themselves 
to the LORD 
in that day 
and will become My people. 

#### `Clearly a reference to the day of the Lord when the nations will be dependent and directly connected through Israel's rule. About 20 References of "*in that day*" are found in Zechariah. When God returns and comforts Jerusalem. When God defends the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Zech 12:6 When God will destroy the nations that come up against Jerusalem. Zech 12:3, 9  When God will remove all idolatry from the land. Zech 13:2 When Messiah stands on the mount of Olives. He will reign over all the earth from Zion. Zech 14:4, 9`

#### `This must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst.`   

Then I will dwell in your midst, `Messiah, God himself in the person of Jesus Christ will one day dwell in their midst forever. `

####                          and you will know 
that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. 
"The LORD will possess Judah 
as His portion in the holy land, 
and will again choose Jerusalem. `Though Israel was chosen by God in the past and given wonderful and eternal promises, in the present God has placed His program with them on hold. One day though, God will once again work directly in and through Israel. Rom 11:11-12, 25`

####                             "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation." 

`God is angered at the current situation and laxness of the nations regarding His nation, His people, His land, His city, Jerusalem and especially His house, the temple. Isa 62:1-4`

### **Joshua the high priest and his friends**

`Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35`
`Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when "the Branch" rules`

Then he showed me Joshua 
			the high priest 
				standing before the angel of the LORD, 
			and Satan 
					standing at his right hand 
								to accuse him. 
		The LORD said to Satan, 
			"The LORD rebuke you, Satan!  `This must be Jesus rebuking Satan`
			Indeed, the LORD 
						who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! `Satan's accusation is directed against Israel, the priestly system and Jerusalem.`
					Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" 
	Now Joshua 
			was clothed		 
			with filthy garments 
			and standing before the angel. 
							He spoke and said to those 
										who were standing before him, 
							saying, 
									"Remove the filthy garments from him." `Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments?`
							Again he said to him, 
									"See, I have taken your iniquity away 
												from you 
												and will clothe you 
												with festal robes." `This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's.`
							Then I said, 
									"Let them put a clean turban on his head." `Perhaps the obvious next step, "don't forget the turban!!". Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on...`
							So they put a clean turban 
									on his head 
									and clothed him with garments, 
											while the angel of the LORD was standing by. 
			And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, 
					saying, 
						"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
							'If you will walk in My ways 
							and if you will perform My service, 
								then you will also 
										govern My house  ``God gave the priests the right to govern the temple. Eze 44:15-16 Interestingly, when Jesus comes, he confronts the chief priests and removes all doubt that they had lost this privilege because of their disobedience. Matt 21:23-27`
										and also have charge of My courts,  `The temple had different courts for the men, for the women and for the gentiles. The priests would be placed in charge of all the courts.` 
										and I will grant you 
										free access among these 
										who are standing *here.* `The priests had access into the holy place, the high priest had access right into the holy of holies once a year. The was a tremendous privilege for the Jewish priest. ` 

`Notice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here..."IF you will walk...then you will govern my house". The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.`

`In the church age, every believer has been given priesthood status and has access directly to the throne of grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 2:5`


​							'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, `Zechariah was to communicate this directly to Joshua the high priest.`
​										you and your friends 
​												who are sitting in front of you—
​										indeed they are men who are a symbol,  `you and your friends - friends symbolize all the priests`
​										for behold, I am going to bring in My servant 
​												the Branch.  `God would provide a priest of his own from a separate order, a true servant. clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jer 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13`
​							'For behold, the stone 
​							that I have set before Joshua; 
​								on one stone are seven eyes.  `THis addition is very interesting..."before Joshua" the stone. The cornerstone.  The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6`
​							Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' 
​										declares the LORD of hosts, 
​							'and I will remove the iniquity 
​										of that land in one day. 
​										'In that day,' `this is Messianic prophecy`
​													declares the LORD of hosts, 
​							'every one of you will invite his neighbor 
​										to *sit* under *his* vine 
​										and under *his* fig tree.'"  `rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Hab 3:17`



### A Lampstand of gold

Then the angel 
		who was speaking with me 
returned and roused me, 
	as a man who is awakened from his sleep.  `Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to so he was wide awake when receiving the vision.`
He said to me, 
	"What do you see?" 
And I said, 
	"I see, and behold, 
		a lampstand all of gold 
				with its bowl on the top of it,  `a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks`
				and its seven lamps on it 
				with seven spouts 
							belonging to each of the lamps 
							which are on the top of it;  `Ex 25:37`
		also two olive trees by it, 
				one on the right side of the bowl 
				and the other on its left side." 
Then I said to the angel 
	who was speaking with me saying, 
	"What are these, my lord?" 
So the angel 
	who was speaking with me 
answered and said to me, 
	"Do you not know what these are?" 
And I said,
	"No, my lord." 
Then he said to me,  `particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained`
	"This is the word of the LORD 
	to Zerubbabel saying, `a specific message to Zerubbabel... `who is Zerubabel? Zerubbabel was a descendant of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Mt. 1:6, 12). His name probably means “seed of Babylon”; but his Persian name was Sheshbazzar, suggesting he may have been in the service of the king (Ezra 1:8—5:14). Yet Zerubbabel left all the comforts of Babylon behind to take on this challenge.`

'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts.  `certainly contrary to those who say, "ease does not produce strength". Grace is what teaches us about God's provision against sin, God inner strengthening of His Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit teaches us in all truth (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are commanded to get our strenghtening by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2)`
		'What are you, O great mountain? 
		Before Zerubbabel *you will become* a plain;  `nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! `
		and he will bring forth the top stone 
		with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'"  `The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubbabel Zerubbabel or look what we accomplished. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!`  
	Also the word of the LORD came to me, 
	saying, 
		"The hands of Zerubbabel 
		have laid the foundation of this house,  
		and his hands will finish *it.*  `Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God.This prophecy was fulfilled when the temple was completed five years later in 515b.C. `

​	Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 
​	"For who has despised the day of small things? 
​	But these seven will be glad 
​	when they see the plumb line 
​	in the hand of Zerubbabel—`a plumb line is used for building. When God sees them back at rebuilding the temple, it will be a joyous thing to God. `
​	*these are* the eyes of the LORD `the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6`
​	which range to and fro 
​	throughout the earth." 

Then I said to him, 
	"What are these two olive trees 
	on the right of the lampstand 
	and on its left?" 

And I answered the second time and said to him, 
	"What are the two olive branches 
			which are beside the two golden pipes, 
			which empty the golden *oil* from themselves?" 

So he answered me, saying, 
	"Do you not know what these are?" 
And I said, 
	"No, my lord." 
Then he said, 
	"These are the two anointed ones 
		who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth."  `Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4`

### **A Flying Scroll**

Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, 
and behold, *there was* a flying scroll. 
And he said to me, 
	"What do you see?" 
And I answered, 
	"I see a flying scroll; 
			its length is twenty cubits 
			and its width ten cubits." `the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5?`
Then he said to me, 
	"This is the curse 
		that is going forth over the face 
		of the whole land; 
		surely everyone who steals will be purged away 
			according to the writing on one side, 
		and everyone who swears 
			will be purged away 
		according to the writing on the other side. 
		"I will make it go forth," 
			declares the LORD of hosts, 
		"and it will enter the house of the thief 
			and the house of the one 
			who swears falsely by My name; 
			and it will spend the night 
			within that house 
			and consume it with its timber and stones." 



### **Ephah going forth**

Then the angel 
	who was speaking with me 
went out and said to me, 
	"Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth." 
I said, 
	"What is it?" 
And he said, 
	"This is the ephah going forth." 
Again he said, 
	"This is their appearance in all the land 
	(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); 
	and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah." 
Then he said, 
	"This is Wickedness!" 
	And he threw her down 
	into the middle of the ephah 
	and cast the lead weight on its opening. 



### Two Women

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, 
and there two women 
were coming out with the wind in their wings; 
and they had wings 
	like the wings of a stork, 
and they lifted up the ephah 
between the earth and the heavens. 
I said to the angel who was speaking with me, 
	"Where are they taking the ephah?" 
Then he said to me, 
	"To build a temple for her 
	in the land of Shinar; 
	and when it is prepared, 
	she will be set there on her own pedestal." 



### Four Chariots

Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, 
and behold, 
		four chariots were coming forth 
			from between the two mountains; 
				and the mountains *were* bronze mountains. 
		With the first chariot *were* red horses, 
		with the second chariot black horses, 
		with the third chariot white horses, 
		and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. 
Then I spoke and said to the angel 
	who was speaking with me, 
		"What are these, my lord?" 
The angel replied to me, 
	"These are the four spirits of heaven, 
			going forth 
					after standing before the Lord of all the earth, 
			with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; 
	and the white ones go forth after them, 
	while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. 
	"When the strong ones went out, 
	they were eager to go to patrol the earth." 
And He said, 
	"Go, patrol the earth." 
	So they patrolled the earth. 
Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, 
	"See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north." 
The word of the LORD also came to me, 
saying, 
	"Take *an offering* 
		from the exiles, 
			from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; 
	and you go the same day 
	and enter the house of Josiah 
		the son of Zephaniah, 
	where they have arrived from Babylon. 
	"Take silver and gold, 
			make an *ornate* crown 
				and set *it*on the head of Joshua 
						the son of Jehozadak, 
							the high priest. 
					"Then say to him, 
							'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
							"Behold, a man 
							whose name is Branch, 
										for He will branch out from where He is; 
										and He will build the temple of the LORD. 
										"Yes, it is He 
										who will build the temple of the LORD, 
										and He who will bear the honor 
										and sit and rule 
										on His throne. 
											Thus, He will be 
												a priest 
												on His throne, 
												and the counsel of peace 
												will be between the two offices."' 
							"Now the crown will become a reminder 
									in the temple of the LORD 
										to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen 
												the son of Zephaniah. 
									"Those who are far off 
										will come and build the temple of the LORD." 
										Then you will know 
											that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 
												And it will take place 
												if you completely obey the LORD your God. 



## IV. Message #3 - 

In the fourth year of King Darius, 
the word of the LORD came to Zechariah 
	on the fourth *day* 
	of the ninth month, 
	*which is* Chislev. 
Now *the town of* Bethel 
had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech 
and their men 
to seek the favor of the LORD, 
speaking to the priests 
	who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, 
	and to the prophets, saying, 
		"Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, 
		as I have done these many years?" 
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
	"Say to all the people 
			of the land 
			and to the priests, 
	'When you fasted and mourned 
			in the fifth and seventh months 
			these seventy years, 
	was it actually for Me that you fasted? 
	'When you eat and drink, 
		do you not eat for yourselves 
		and do you not drink for yourselves? 
	'Are not *these* the words 
			which the LORD proclaimed 
			by the former prophets, 
			when Jerusalem was inhabited 
			and prosperous 
			along with its cities around it, 
			and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'" 

Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah 
saying,  
	"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 
	'Dispense true justice 
	and practice kindness 
	and compassion each to his brother; 
	and do not oppress 
			the widow 
			or the orphan, 
			the stranger 
			or the poor; 
	and do not devise evil in your hearts 
		against one another.' 
	"But they refused to pay attention 
	and turned a stubborn shoulder 
	and stopped their ears from hearing. 
	"They made their hearts *like* flint 
		so that they could not hear the law 
	and the words 
			which the LORD of hosts had sent 
			by His Spirit 
			through the former prophets; 
	therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. 
	"And just as He called and they would not listen, 
	so they called and I would not listen," 
	says the LORD of hosts; 
			"but I scattered them 
			with a storm wind 
			among all the nations 
					whom they have not known. 
			Thus the land is desolated behind them 
			so that no one went back and forth, 
			for they made the pleasant land desolate." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
	'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, 
	yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.' 
	"Thus says the LORD, 
			'I will return to Zion 
			and will dwell 
					in the midst of Jerusalem. 
			Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, 
			and the mountain of the LORD of hosts 
			*will be called *the Holy Mountain.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'Old men and old women will again sit 
			in the streets of Jerusalem, 
			each man with his staff in his hand 
			because of age.  
			'And the streets of the city 
			will be filled with boys and girls 
					playing in its streets.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'If it is too difficult 
			in the sight of the remnant of this people 
			in those days, 
			will it also be too difficult in My sight?' 
					declares the LORD of hosts. 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'Behold, I am going to save My people 
			from the land of the east 
			and from the land of the west; 
			and I will bring them *back* 
			and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; 
			and they shall be My people, 
			and I will be their God 
					in truth and righteousness.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'Let your hands be strong, 
			you who are listening 
					in these days 
					to these words 
					from the mouth of the prophets, 
			*those* who *spoke* 
						in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, 
			to the end that the temple might be built. 
			'For before those days there was no wage 
			for man or any wage for animal; 
			and for him 
					who went out 
					or came in 
					there was no peace 
			because of his enemies, 
			and I set all men one against another. 
			'But now I will not treat the remnant 
					of this people 
			as in the former days,
					' declares the LORD of hosts. 
			'For *there will be* peace 
				for the seed: 
						the vine will yield its fruit, 
						the land will yield its produce 
						and the heavens will give their dew; 
						and I will cause the remnant 
								of this people to inherit all these *things.* 
			'It will come about 
					that just as you were a curse 
					among the nations, 
						O house of Judah and house of Israel, 
				so I will save you 
				that you may become a blessing. 
				Do not fear; let your hands be strong.' 
				"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 
							'Just as I purposed to do harm to you 
							when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' 
				says the LORD of hosts, 
						'and I have not relented, 
						so I have again purposed 
							in these days 
						to do good to Jerusalem 
						and to the house of Judah. 
					Do not fear! 
		'These are the things which you should do: 
				speak the truth to one another; 
				judge with truth and judgment 
				for peace in your gates. 
				'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart 
						against another, 
				and do not love perjury; 
						for all these are what I hate,' 
				declares the LORD." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'The fast of the fourth, 
			the fast of the fifth, 
			the fast of the seventh 
			and the fast of the tenth *months* 
			will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts 
			for the house of Judah; 
			so love truth and peace.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'*It will* yet *be* that peoples will come, 
					even the inhabitants of many cities. 
			'The inhabitants of one will go to another, 
					saying, 
								"Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, 
								and to seek the LORD of hosts; 
								I will also go." 
				'So many peoples and mighty nations will come 
						to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem 
						and to entreat the favor of the LORD.' 
		"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
				'In those days 
				ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, 
				saying, 
						"Let us go with you, 
						for we have heard that God is with you."'" 

## V. Message #4 - The Two Burdens

### Burden #1 - The First Coming
The burden 
		of the word of the LORD 
is against 
		the land of Hadrach, 
				with Damascus 
					as its resting place 
							(for the eyes of men, 
							especially of all the tribes of Israel, 
							are toward the LORD), 
			And Hamath also, 
						which borders on it; 
				Tyre and Sidon, 
						though they are very wise. 
							For Tyre built herself a fortress 
								And piled up silver like dust, 
								And gold like the mire of the streets. 
								Behold, the Lord will dispossess her 
								And cast her wealth into the sea; 
								And she will be consumed with fire. 
					Ashkelon will see *it* and be afraid. 
					Gaza too will writhe in great pain; 
					Also Ekron, 
							for her expectation has been confounded. 
					Moreover, 
					the king will perish from Gaza, 
					And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. 
					And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, 
					And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
									And I will remove their blood from their mouth 
									And their detestable things from between their teeth. 
									Then they also will be a remnant for our God, 
									And be like a clan in Judah, 
					And Ekron like a Jebusite. 
		But I will camp around My house 
				because of an army, 
				Because of him who passes by and returns; 
				And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, 
				For now I have seen with My eyes. 
							Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! 
							Shout *in triumph,* 
							O daughter of Jerusalem! 
				Behold, your king is coming to you; 
							He is just 
							and endowed with salvation, 
							Humble, 
							and mounted on a donkey, 
							Even on a colt, 
							the foal of a donkey. 
						I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim 
						And the horse from Jerusalem; 
						And the bow of war will be cut off. 
							And He will speak peace to the nations; 
							And His dominion will be from sea to sea, 
							And from the River to the ends of the earth. 
							As for you also, 
							because of the blood of *My* covenant with you, 
									I have set your prisoners free 
											from the waterless pit. 
											Return to the stronghold, 
											O prisoners who have the hope; 
				This very day 
						I am declaring 
						that I will restore double to you. 
						For I will bend Judah as My bow, 
							I will fill the bow with Ephraim. 
								And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, 
									against your sons, 
										O Greece; 
						And I will make you like a warrior's sword. 
							Then the LORD will appear over them, 
							And His arrow will go forth like lightning; 
							And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, 
							And will march in the storm winds of the south. 
							The LORD of hosts will defend them. 
								And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; 
								And they will drink *and*be boisterous as with wine; 
								And they will be filled like a *sacrificial* basin, 
										*Drenched* like the corners of the altar. 
								And the LORD their God will save them 
									in that day 
												As the flock of His people; 
												For *they are as* the stones of a crown, 
												Sparkling in His land. 
												For what comeliness and beauty *will be* theirs! 
												Grain will make the young men flourish, 
												and new wine the virgins. 
														Ask rain from the LORD 
																at the time of the spring rain—
																The LORD who makes the storm clouds; 
																And He will give them showers of rain, 
																vegetation in the field to *each* man. 
																			For the teraphim speak iniquity, 
														And the diviners 
																see lying visions 
																And tell false dreams; 
																They comfort in vain. 
																Therefore *the people* wander like sheep, 
																		They are afflicted, 
																because there is no shepherd. 
																	"My anger is kindled 
																			against the shepherds, 
														And I will punish the male goats; 
																	For the LORD of hosts 
																	has visited His flock, 
																			the house of Judah, 
																			And will make them 
																			like His majestic horse in battle. 
																			"From them 
																					will come the cornerstone, 
																			From them 
																					the tent peg, 
																			From them 
																					the bow of battle, 
																			From them 
																					every ruler, 
																			*all* of them 
																					together. 
																					"They will be as mighty men, 
																					Treading down *the enemy*
																						in the mire of the streets in battle; 
																					And they will fight, 
																								for the LORD *will be* with them; 
																								And the riders on horses will be put to shame. 
																	"I will strengthen the house of Judah, 
																		And I will save the house of Joseph, 
																		And I will bring them back, 
																				Because I have had compassion on them; 
																				And they will be as though I had not rejected them, 
																				For I am the LORD their God 
																				and I will answer them. 
																				"Ephraim will be like a mighty man, 
																				And their heart will be glad 
																						as if *from* wine; 
																				Indeed, their children will see *it* and be glad, 
																				Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. 
																		"I will whistle for them 
																				to gather them together, 
																				For I have redeemed them; 
																				And they will be as numerous as they were before. 
													"When I scatter them among the peoples, 
															They will remember Me in far countries, 
															And they 
															with their children 
															will live and come back. 
													"I will bring them back 
																from the land of Egypt 
																And gather them from Assyria; 
														And I will bring them 
																into the land of Gilead 
																and Lebanon 
																Until no *room* can be found for them. 
														"And they will pass 
																	through the sea *of* distress 
															And He will strike the waves in the sea, 
																	So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; 
																	And the pride of Assyria will be brought down 
																	And the scepter of Egypt will depart. 
																	"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, 
																		And in His name they will walk," 
																		declares the LORD. 
												Open your doors, O Lebanon, 
																That a fire may feed on your cedars. 
												Wail, O cypress, 
															for the cedar has fallen, 
															Because the glorious *trees* have been destroyed; 
												Wail, O oaks of Bashan, 
														For the impenetrable forest has come down. 
												There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, 
														For their glory is ruined; 
														There is a sound of the young lions' roar, 
													For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. 
						Thus says the LORD my God, 
								"Pasture the flock 
										*doomed* to slaughter. 
										"Those who buy them 
													slay them and go unpunished, 
													and *each of* those 
																who sell them says, 
																			'Blessed be the LORD, 
																			for I have become rich!' 
													And their own shepherds have no pity on them. 
											"For I will no longer have pity 
													on the inhabitants of the land," 
													declares the LORD; 
					"but behold, I will cause the men to fall, 
							each into another's power 
							and into the power of his king; 
								and they will strike the land, 
								and I will not deliver *them* from their power." 
						So I pastured the flock 
									*doomed* to slaughter, 
									hence the afflicted of the flock. 
									And I took for myself two staffs: 
												the one I called Favor 
												and the other I called Union; 
						so I pastured the flock. 
									Then I annihilated the three shepherds 
											in one month, 
											for my soul was impatient with them, 
											and their soul also was weary of me. 
											Then I said, "I will not pasture you. 
													What is to die, let it die, 
														and what is to be annihilated, 
														let it be annihilated; 
														and let those who are left 
														eat one another's flesh." 
										I took my staff Favor 
													and cut it in pieces, 
													to break my covenant 
																which I had made with all the peoples. 
													So it was broken on that day, 
																and thus the afflicted of the flock 
																who were watching me 
																			realized that it was the word of the LORD. 
																			I said to them, 
																					"If it is good in your sight, 
																					give *me* my wages; 
																					but if not, never mind!" 
																					So they weighed out thirty *shekels* of silver as my wages. 
																	Then the LORD said to me, 
																				"Throw it to the potter, 
																					*that* magnificent price 
																								at which I was valued by them." 
																	So I took the thirty *shekels* of silver 
																			and threw them to the potter 
																					in the house of the LORD. 
																Then I cut in pieces 
																my second staff Union, 
																				to break the brotherhood 
																						between Judah and Israel. 
													The LORD said to me, 
																"Take again for yourself 
																	the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 
																	"For behold, 
																	I am going to raise up a shepherd 
																			in the land 
																			who will not care for the perishing, 
																			seek the scattered, 
																			heal the broken, 
																			or sustain the one standing, 
																			but will devour the flesh of the fat *sheep* and tear off their hoofs. 
																		"Woe to the worthless shepherd 
																					Who leaves the flock! 
																					A sword will be on his arm 
																					And on his right eye! 
																					His arm will be totally withered 
																					And his right eye will be blind." 

### Burden #2 - The Second Coming

The burden of the word of the LORD 
		concerning Israel. 
		*Thus* declares the LORD 
					who stretches out the heavens, 
					lays the foundation of the earth, 
					and forms the spirit of man within him, 
				"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem 
						a cup that causes reeling 
						to all the peoples around; 
						and when the siege is against Jerusalem, 
						it will also be against Judah. 
					"It will come about 
							in that day 
									that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone 
									for all the peoples; 
									all who lift it will be severely injured. 
									And all the nations of the earth 
									will be gathered against it. 
							"In that day," declares the LORD, 
									"I will strike every horse with bewilderment 
									and his rider with madness. 
									But I will watch over the house of Judah, 
											while I strike every horse of the peoples 
													with blindness. 
								"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 
									'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
											through the LORD of hosts, their God.' 
							"In that day 
									I will make the clans of Judah 
											like a firepot 
											among pieces of wood 
											and a flaming torch among sheaves, 
											so they will consume on the right hand 
											and on the left all the surrounding peoples, 
												while the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
												again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. 
									"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, 
														so that the glory of the house of David 
												and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
												will not be magnified above Judah. 
								"In that day 
											the LORD will defend 
													the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
													and the one who is feeble among them 
													in that day will be like David, 
													and the house of David *will be* like God, 
													like the angel of the LORD before them. 
								"And in that day 
											I will set about 
													to destroy all the nations 
															that come against Jerusalem. 
														"I will pour out on the house of David 
														and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
													the Spirit of grace 
													and of supplication, 
															so that they will look on Me 
																		whom they have pierced; 
																		and they will mourn for Him, 
																		as one mourns for an only son, 
																		and they will weep bitterly over Him 
																		like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. 
												"In that day 
																there will be great mourning 
in Jerusalem,
																like the mourning of Hadadrimmon 
																		in the plain of Megiddo. 
															"The land will mourn, 
																		every family by itself; 
															the family of the house of David 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															the family of the house of Nathan 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															the family of the house of Levi 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															the family of the Shimeites 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															all the families 
																	that remain, 
																		every family 
																			by itself 
																		and their wives 
																			by themselves. 
													"In that day 
															a fountain will be opened 
																	for the house of David and 
																	for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
																	for sin and for impurity. 
													"It will come about in that day," 
																declares the LORD of hosts, 
																	"that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, 
																	and they will no longer be remembered; 
																	and I will also remove the prophets 
																	and the unclean spirit from the land. 
																	"And if anyone still prophesies, 
																			then his father and mother 
																					who gave birth to him 
																					will say to him, 
																						'You shall not live, 
																								for you have spoken 
																										falsely in the name 																												of the LORD'; 
																				and his father and mother 
																						who gave birth to him 
																								will pierce him through 
																									when he prophesies. 
																					"Also it will come about 
																	in that day 
																			that the prophets will each be ashamed 
																			of his vision when he prophesies, 
																			and they will not put on a hairy robe 
																				in order to deceive; 
																			but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; 
																					I am a tiller of the ground, 
																					for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.' 
																					"And one will say to him, 
																						'What are these wounds between your arms?' 
  																	Then he will say, 
    	'*Those* with which I was wounded 
    in the house of my friends.' 
"Awake, O sword, 
		against My Shepherd, 
			And against the man, 
					My Associate," 
				Declares the LORD of hosts. 
			"Strike the Shepherd 
			that the sheep may be scattered; 
			And I will turn My hand against the little ones. 
		"It will come about in all the land," 
			Declares the LORD, 
		"That two parts in it will be cut off *and* perish; 
		But the third will be left in it. 
			"And I will bring the third part through the fire, 
			Refine them as silver is refined, 
			And test them as gold is tested. 
				They will call on My name, 
			And I will answer them; 
				I will say, 'They are My people,' 
				And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'" 
Behold, a day is coming for the LORD 
		when the spoil taken from you 
		will be divided among you. 
		For I will gather all the nations 
		against Jerusalem to battle, 
		and the city will be captured, 
		the houses plundered, 
		the women ravished 
		and half of the city exiled, 
		but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. 
Then the LORD will go forth 
and fight against those nations, 
as when He fights on a day of battle. 
In that day 
His feet will stand 
on the Mount of Olives, 
	which is in front of Jerusalem 
	on the east; 
and the Mount of Olives 
will be split in its middle 
from east to west 
by a very large valley, 
so that half of the mountain 
will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. 
You will flee by the valley of My mountains, 
for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; 
yes, you will flee 
		just as you fled before the earthquake 
		in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. 

Then the LORD, my God, will come, 
	*and* all the holy ones with Him! 
	In that day 
			there will be no light; 
			the luminaries will dwindle. 
			For it will be a unique day 
			which is known to the LORD, 
			neither day nor night, 
			but it will come about that at evening time 
			there will be light. 
	And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, 
		half of them toward the eastern sea 
		and the other half toward the western sea; 
			it will be in summer 
			as well as in winter. 
		And the LORD will be king 
		over all the earth; 
in that day 
	the LORD will be *the only* one, 
	and His name *the only* one. 
	All the land will be changed 
	into a plain from Geba 
	to Rimmon 
		south of Jerusalem; 
		but Jerusalem will rise 
		and remain on its site 
	from Benjamin's Gate 
			as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, 
	and from the Tower of Hananel 
		to the king's wine presses. 
	People will live in it, 
	and there will no longer be a curse, 
			for Jerusalem will dwell in security. 

Now this will be the plague 
	with which the LORD 
	will strike all the peoples 
	who have gone to war 
		against Jerusalem; 
	their flesh will rot 
			while they stand on their feet, 
			and their eyes will rot in their sockets, 
			and their tongue will rot in their mouth. 
It will come about in that day 
that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; 
and they will seize one another's hand, 
and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. 
Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; 
and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, 
	gold and silver and garments 
	in great abundance. 

So also like this plague 
will be the plague 
	on the horse, 
	the mule, 
	the camel, 
	the donkey 
	and all the cattle that will be in those camps. 

Then it will come about 
that any 
		who are left of all the nations 
				that went against Jerusalem 
		will go up from year to year 
		to worship the King, 
		the LORD of hosts, 
		and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 
		And it will be that 
				whichever of the families 
				of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem 
				to worship the King, 
				the LORD of hosts, 
				there will be no rain on them. 
				If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, 
						then no *rain will fall* on them; 
					it will be the plague 
					with which the LORD 
						smites the nations 
						who do not go up 
						to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 
						This will be the punishment of Egypt, 
						and the punishment of all the nations 
						who do not go up 
						to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 
In that day 
		there will *be inscribed* 
		on the bells of the horses, 
		"HOLY TO THE LORD." 
		And the cooking pots 
			in the LORD'S house 
		will be like the bowls before the altar. 
		Every cooking pot 
			in Jerusalem and in Judah 
		will be holy to the LORD of hosts; 
		and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. 
		And there will no longer be a Canaanite
		in the house of the LORD of hosts

# **Zechariah**

possible: Israel's Messiah to the Nations
(Phrased + Indented + Comments)

In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, 
the word of the LORD came 
	to Zechariah the prophet, 
		the son of Berechiah, 
			the son of Iddo 
	saying, 
		"The LORD was very angry with your fathers. 
			"Therefore say to them, 
				'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
					"Return to Me," 
							declares the LORD of hosts, 
					"that I may return to you," 
							says the LORD of hosts. 
					"Do not be like your fathers, 
							to whom the former prophets proclaimed, 
									saying, 
										'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
										"Return now from your evil ways 
										and from your evil deeds."' 
							But they did not listen 
							or give heed to Me," 
								declares the LORD. 
						"Your fathers, where are they? 
						And the prophets, do they live forever? 
						"But did not My words and My statutes, 
								which I commanded My servants 
										the prophets, 
						overtake your fathers? 
						Then they repented and said, 
								'As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us 
										in accordance with our ways 
										and our deeds, 
								so He has dealt with us.'"'" 

On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, 
	which is the month Shebat, 
in the second year of Darius, 
the word of the LORD came 
	to Zechariah 
		the prophet, 
		the son of Berechiah, 
		the son of Iddo, 
	as follows: 
		I saw at night, 
		and behold, 
		a man was riding 
			on a red horse, 
		and he was standing 
				among the myrtle trees 
						which were in the ravine, 
		with red, sorrel and white horses 
		behind him. 
		Then I said, "My lord, what are these?" 
		And the angel 
				who was speaking with me said to me, 
					"I will show you what these are." 
		And the man 
				who was standing 
						among the myrtle trees 
		answered and said, 
		"These are those 
				whom the LORD has sent 
				to patrol the earth." 
			So they answered the angel of the LORD 
					who was standing 
							among the myrtle trees 
			and said, 
					"We have patrolled the earth, 
					and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet." 
	

			Then the angel of the LORD said, 
					"O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion 
							for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, 
							with which You have been indignant these seventy years?" 
			The LORD answered the angel 
					who was speaking with me 
			with gracious words, 
				comforting words. 
			So the angel 
					who was speaking with me 
			said to me, 
				"Proclaim, saying, 
						'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
								"I am exceedingly jealous 
											for Jerusalem and Zion. 
								"But I am very angry with the nations 
											who are at ease; 
								for while I was only a little angry, 
								they furthered the disaster." 
										'Therefore thus says the LORD, 
												"I will return to Jerusalem 
															with compassion; 
														My house will be built in it," 
															declares the LORD of hosts, 
															"and a measuring line 
															will be stretched 
															over Jerusalem."' 
												"Again, proclaim, saying, 
															'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
															"My cities will again overflow 
															with prosperity, 
															and the LORD will again 
															comfort Zion 
															and again choose Jerusalem."'" 

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, 
*there were* four horns. 
So I said to the angel 
	who was speaking with me, 
"What are these?" 
And he answered me, 
	"These are the horns 
			which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem." 

Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. 
	I said, "What are these coming to do?" 
	And he said, "These are the horns 
			which have scattered Judah 
			so that no man lifts up his head; 
but these *craftsmen* have come 
	to terrify them, 
	to throw down the horns of the nations 
			who have lifted up *their*horns 
					against the land of Judah 
						in order to scatter it." 

Then I lifted up my eyes 
and looked, 
and behold, 
*there was* a man 
		with a measuring line in his hand. 
So I said, "Where are you going?" 
And he said to me, 
"To measure Jerusalem, 
		to see how wide it is 
		and how long it is." 
And behold, the angel 
		who was speaking with me 
was going out, 
and another angel 
was coming out to meet him, 
and said to him, 
	"Run, speak to that young man, 
	saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls 
		because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. 
		'For I,' declares the LORD, 
		'will be a wall of fire around her, 
		and I will be the glory in her midst.'"  
		"Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," 
				declares the LORD, 
		"for I have dispersed you 
		as the four winds of the heavens," 
				declares the LORD. 
		"Ho, Zion! 
				Escape, 
					you who are living with the daughter of Babylon." 
				For thus says the LORD of hosts, 
				"After glory He has sent me 
							against the nations 
									which plunder you, 
				for he who touches you, 
						touches the apple of His eye. 
				"For behold, 
					I will wave My hand over them 
					so that they will be plunder for their slaves. 
					Then you will know 
					that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. 
				"Sing for joy and be glad, 
				O daughter of Zion; 
						for behold I am coming 
						and I will dwell in your midst," 
								declares the LORD. 
					"Many nations will join themselves 
					to the LORD 
							in that day 
					and will become My people. 
					Then I will dwell in your midst, 
					and you will know 
					that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. 
					"The LORD will possess Judah 
					as His portion in the holy land, 
					and will again choose Jerusalem. 
					"Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; 
					for He is aroused from His holy habitation." 
	

	Then he showed me Joshua 
			the high priest 
	standing before the angel of the LORD, 
	and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
		The LORD said to Satan, 
			"The LORD rebuke you, Satan! 
			Indeed, the LORD 
			who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! 
			Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" 
	Now Joshua was clothed 
	with filthy garments 
	and standing before the angel. 
	He spoke and said to those 
	who were standing before him, 
		saying, "Remove the filthy garments from him." 
		Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away 
		from you and will clothe you with festal robes." 
	Then I said, 
		"Let them put a clean turban on his head." 
	So they put a clean turban 
		on his head 
		and clothed him with garments, 
			while the angel of the LORD was standing by. 
			And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, 
					saying, 
						"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
							'If you will walk in My ways 
							and if you will perform My service, 
							then you will also govern My house 
							and also have charge of My courts, 
							and I will grant you free access among these 
									who are standing *here.* 
							'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, 
							you and your friends 
									who are sitting in front of you—
							indeed they are men who are a symbol, 
							for behold, I am going to bring in My servant 
								the Branch. 
							'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; 
								on one stone are seven eyes. 
							Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' 
							declares the LORD of hosts, 
							'and I will remove the iniquity 
							of that land in one day. 
							'In that day,' 
										declares the LORD of hosts, 
							'every one of you will invite his neighbor 
							to *sit* under *his* vine 
							and under *his* fig tree.'" 

Then the angel 
		who was speaking with me 
returned and roused me, 
	as a man who is awakened from his sleep. 
He said to me, 
	"What do you see?" 
And I said, 
	"I see, and behold, 
		a lampstand all of gold 
				with its bowl on the top of it, 
				and its seven lamps on it 
				with seven spouts 
							belonging to each of the lamps 
							which are on the top of it; 
		also two olive trees by it, 
				one on the right side of the bowl 
				and the other on its left side." 

Then I said to the angel 
	who was speaking with me saying, 
	"What are these, my lord?" 
So the angel 
	who was speaking with me 
answered and said to me, 
	"Do you not know what these are?" 
And I said,
	"No, my lord." 

Then he said to me, 
	"This is the word of the LORD 
	to Zerubbabel saying, 
		'Not by might nor by power, 
		but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts. 
		'What are you, O great mountain? 
		Before Zerubbabel *you will become* a plain; 
		and he will bring forth the top stone 
		with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'" 
	Also the word of the LORD came to me, 
	saying, 
		"The hands of Zerubbabel 
		have laid the foundation of this house, 
		and his hands will finish *it.* 
	Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 
	"For who has despised the day of small things? 
	But these seven will be glad 
	when they see the plumb line 
	in the hand of Zerubbabel—
	*these are* the eyes of the LORD 
	which range to and fro 
	throughout the earth." 
Then I said to him, 
	"What are these two olive trees 
	on the right of the lampstand 
	and on its left?" 
And I answered the second time and said to him, 
	"What are the two olive branches 
			which are beside the two golden pipes, 
			which empty the golden *oil* from themselves?" 
So he answered me, saying, 
	"Do you not know what these are?" 
And I said, 
	"No, my lord." 
Then he said, 
	"These are the two anointed ones 
		who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth." 

Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, 
and behold, *there was* a flying scroll. 
And he said to me, 
	"What do you see?" 
And I answered, 
	"I see a flying scroll; 
			its length is twenty cubits 
			and its width ten cubits." 

Then he said to me, 
	"This is the curse 
		that is going forth over the face 
		of the whole land; 
		surely everyone who steals will be purged away 
			according to the writing on one side, 
		and everyone who swears 
			will be purged away 
		according to the writing on the other side. 
		"I will make it go forth," 
			declares the LORD of hosts, 
		"and it will enter the house of the thief 
			and the house of the one 
			who swears falsely by My name; 
			and it will spend the night 
			within that house 
			and consume it with its timber and stones." 

Then the angel 
	who was speaking with me 
went out and said to me, 
	"Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth." 
I said, 
	"What is it?" 
And he said, 
	"This is the ephah going forth." 
Again he said, 
	"This is their appearance in all the land 
	(and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); 
	and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah." 
Then he said, 
	"This is Wickedness!" 
	And he threw her down 
	into the middle of the ephah 
	and cast the lead weight on its opening. 

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, 
and there two women 
were coming out with the wind in their wings; 
and they had wings 
	like the wings of a stork, 
and they lifted up the ephah 
between the earth and the heavens. 
I said to the angel who was speaking with me, 
	"Where are they taking the ephah?" 
Then he said to me, 
	"To build a temple for her 
	in the land of Shinar; 
	and when it is prepared, 
	she will be set there on her own pedestal." 

Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, 
and behold, four chariots were coming forth 
from between the two mountains; 
and the mountains *were* bronze mountains. 
With the first chariot *were* red horses, 
with the second chariot black horses, 
with the third chariot white horses, 
and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. 
Then I spoke and said to the angel 
	who was speaking with me, 
		"What are these, my lord?" 
The angel replied to me, 
	"These are the four spirits of heaven, 
	going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, 
	with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; 
	and the white ones go forth after them, 
	while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. 
	"When the strong ones went out, 
	they were eager to go to patrol the earth." 
And He said, 
	"Go, patrol the earth." 
	So they patrolled the earth. 
Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, 
	"See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north." 
The word of the LORD also came to me, 
saying, 
	"Take *an offering* 
		from the exiles, 
			from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; 
	and you go the same day 
	and enter the house of Josiah 
		the son of Zephaniah, 
	where they have arrived from Babylon. 
	"Take silver and gold, 
	make an *ornate* crown 
	and set *it*on the head of Joshua 
		the son of Jehozadak, 
			the high priest. 
		"Then say to him, 
			'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			"Behold, a man 
			whose name is Branch, 
					for He will branch out from where He is; 
					and He will build the temple of the LORD. 
					"Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, 
					and He who will bear the honor 
					and sit and rule on His throne. 
					Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, 
					and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."' 
	"Now the crown will become a reminder 
		in the temple of the LORD 
			to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen 
				the son of Zephaniah. 
	"Those who are far off 
	will come and build the temple of the LORD." 
	Then you will know 
	that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 
	And it will take place 
		if you completely obey the LORD your God. 

In the fourth year of King Darius, 
the word of the LORD came to Zechariah 
	on the fourth *day* 
	of the ninth month, 
	*which is* Chislev. 
Now *the town of* Bethel 
had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech 
and their men 
to seek the favor of the LORD, 
speaking to the priests 
	who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, 
	and to the prophets, saying, 
		"Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, 
		as I have done these many years?" 
Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
	"Say to all the people 
			of the land 
			and to the priests, 
	'When you fasted and mourned 
			in the fifth and seventh months 
			these seventy years, 
	was it actually for Me that you fasted? 
	'When you eat and drink, 
		do you not eat for yourselves 
		and do you not drink for yourselves? 
	'Are not *these* the words 
			which the LORD proclaimed 
			by the former prophets, 
			when Jerusalem was inhabited 
			and prosperous 
			along with its cities around it, 
			and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'" 

Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah 
saying,  
	"Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 
	'Dispense true justice 
	and practice kindness 
	and compassion each to his brother; 
	and do not oppress 
			the widow 
			or the orphan, 
			the stranger 
			or the poor; 
	and do not devise evil in your hearts 
		against one another.' 
	"But they refused to pay attention 
	and turned a stubborn shoulder 
	and stopped their ears from hearing. 
	"They made their hearts *like* flint 
		so that they could not hear the law 
	and the words 
			which the LORD of hosts had sent 
			by His Spirit 
			through the former prophets; 
	therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. 
	"And just as He called and they would not listen, 
	so they called and I would not listen," 
	says the LORD of hosts; 
			"but I scattered them 
			with a storm wind 
			among all the nations 
					whom they have not known. 
			Thus the land is desolated behind them 
			so that no one went back and forth, 
			for they made the pleasant land desolate." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
	'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, 
	yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.' 
	"Thus says the LORD, 
			'I will return to Zion 
			and will dwell 
					in the midst of Jerusalem. 
			Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, 
			and the mountain of the LORD of hosts 
			*will be called *the Holy Mountain.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'Old men and old women will again sit 
			in the streets of Jerusalem, 
			each man with his staff in his hand 
			because of age.  
			'And the streets of the city 
			will be filled with boys and girls 
					playing in its streets.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'If it is too difficult 
			in the sight of the remnant of this people 
			in those days, 
			will it also be too difficult in My sight?' 
					declares the LORD of hosts. 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'Behold, I am going to save My people 
			from the land of the east 
			and from the land of the west; 
			and I will bring them *back* 
			and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; 
			and they shall be My people, 
			and I will be their God 
					in truth and righteousness.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'Let your hands be strong, 
			you who are listening 
					in these days 
					to these words 
					from the mouth of the prophets, 
			*those* who *spoke* 
						in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, 
			to the end that the temple might be built. 
			'For before those days there was no wage 
			for man or any wage for animal; 
			and for him 
					who went out 
					or came in 
					there was no peace 
			because of his enemies, 
			and I set all men one against another. 
			'But now I will not treat the remnant 
					of this people 
			as in the former days,
					' declares the LORD of hosts. 
			'For *there will be* peace 
				for the seed: 
						the vine will yield its fruit, 
						the land will yield its produce 
						and the heavens will give their dew; 
						and I will cause the remnant 
								of this people to inherit all these *things.* 
			'It will come about 
					that just as you were a curse 
					among the nations, 
						O house of Judah and house of Israel, 
				so I will save you 
				that you may become a blessing. 
				Do not fear; let your hands be strong.' 
				"For thus says the LORD of hosts, 
							'Just as I purposed to do harm to you 
							when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' 
				says the LORD of hosts, 
						'and I have not relented, 
						so I have again purposed 
							in these days 
						to do good to Jerusalem 
						and to the house of Judah. 
					Do not fear! 
		'These are the things which you should do: 
				speak the truth to one another; 
				judge with truth and judgment 
				for peace in your gates. 
				'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart 
						against another, 
				and do not love perjury; 
						for all these are what I hate,' 
				declares the LORD." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'The fast of the fourth, 
			the fast of the fifth, 
			the fast of the seventh 
			and the fast of the tenth *months* 
			will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts 
			for the house of Judah; 
			so love truth and peace.' 
	"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
			'*It will* yet *be* that peoples will come, 
					even the inhabitants of many cities. 
			'The inhabitants of one will go to another, 
					saying, 
								"Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, 
								and to seek the LORD of hosts; 
								I will also go." 
				'So many peoples and mighty nations will come 
						to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem 
						and to entreat the favor of the LORD.' 
		"Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
				'In those days 
				ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, 
				saying, 
						"Let us go with you, 
						for we have heard that God is with you."'" 

The burden of the word of the LORD is against 
		the land of Hadrach, 
				with Damascus 
		as its resting place 
(for the eyes of men, 
		especially of all the tribes of Israel, 
		are toward the LORD), 
			And Hamath also, 
					which borders on it; 
				Tyre and Sidon, 
						though they are very wise. 
							For Tyre built herself a fortress 
								And piled up silver like dust, 
								And gold like the mire of the streets. 
								Behold, the Lord will dispossess her 
								And cast her wealth into the sea; 
								And she will be consumed with fire. 
					Ashkelon will see *it* and be afraid. 
					Gaza too will writhe in great pain; 
					Also Ekron, 
							for her expectation has been confounded. 
					Moreover, 
					the king will perish from Gaza, 
					And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. 
					And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, 
					And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
									And I will remove their blood from their mouth 
									And their detestable things from between their teeth. 
									Then they also will be a remnant for our God, 
									And be like a clan in Judah, 
					And Ekron like a Jebusite. 
		But I will camp around My house 
				because of an army, 
				Because of him who passes by and returns; 
				And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, 
				For now I have seen with My eyes. 
							Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! 
							Shout *in triumph,* 
							O daughter of Jerusalem! 
				Behold, your king is coming to you; 
							He is just 
							and endowed with salvation, 
							Humble, 
							and mounted on a donkey, 
							Even on a colt, 
							the foal of a donkey. 
						I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim 
						And the horse from Jerusalem; 
						And the bow of war will be cut off. 
							And He will speak peace to the nations; 
							And His dominion will be from sea to sea, 
							And from the River to the ends of the earth. 
							As for you also, 
							because of the blood of *My* covenant with you, 
									I have set your prisoners free 
											from the waterless pit. 
											Return to the stronghold, 
											O prisoners who have the hope; 
				This very day 
						I am declaring 
						that I will restore double to you. 
						For I will bend Judah as My bow, 
							I will fill the bow with Ephraim. 
								And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, 
									against your sons, 
										O Greece; 
						And I will make you like a warrior's sword. 
							Then the LORD will appear over them, 
							And His arrow will go forth like lightning; 
							And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, 
							And will march in the storm winds of the south. 
							The LORD of hosts will defend them. 
								And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; 
								And they will drink *and*be boisterous as with wine; 
								And they will be filled like a *sacrificial* basin, 
										*Drenched* like the corners of the altar. 
								And the LORD their God will save them 
									in that day 
												As the flock of His people; 
												For *they are as* the stones of a crown, 
												Sparkling in His land. 
												For what comeliness and beauty *will be* theirs! 
												Grain will make the young men flourish, 
												and new wine the virgins. 
														Ask rain from the LORD 
																at the time of the spring rain—
																The LORD who makes the storm clouds; 
																And He will give them showers of rain, 
																vegetation in the field to *each* man. 
																			For the teraphim speak iniquity, 
														And the diviners 
																see lying visions 
																And tell false dreams; 
																They comfort in vain. 
																Therefore *the people* wander like sheep, 
																		They are afflicted, 
																because there is no shepherd. 
																	"My anger is kindled 
																			against the shepherds, 
														And I will punish the male goats; 
																	For the LORD of hosts 
																	has visited His flock, 
																			the house of Judah, 
																			And will make them 
																			like His majestic horse in battle. 
																			"From them 
																					will come the cornerstone, 
																			From them 
																					the tent peg, 
																			From them 
																					the bow of battle, 
																			From them 
																					every ruler, 
																			*all* of them 
																					together. 
																					"They will be as mighty men, 
																					Treading down *the enemy*
																						in the mire of the streets in battle; 
																					And they will fight, 
																								for the LORD *will be* with them; 
																								And the riders on horses will be put to shame. 
																	"I will strengthen the house of Judah, 
																		And I will save the house of Joseph, 
																		And I will bring them back, 
																				Because I have had compassion on them; 
																				And they will be as though I had not rejected them, 
																				For I am the LORD their God 
																				and I will answer them. 
																				"Ephraim will be like a mighty man, 
																				And their heart will be glad 
																						as if *from* wine; 
																				Indeed, their children will see *it* and be glad, 
																				Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. 
																		"I will whistle for them 
																				to gather them together, 
																				For I have redeemed them; 
																				And they will be as numerous as they were before. 
													"When I scatter them among the peoples, 
															They will remember Me in far countries, 
															And they 
															with their children 
															will live and come back. 
													"I will bring them back 
																from the land of Egypt 
																And gather them from Assyria; 
														And I will bring them 
																into the land of Gilead 
																and Lebanon 
																Until no *room* can be found for them. 
														"And they will pass 
																	through the sea *of* distress 
															And He will strike the waves in the sea, 
																	So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; 
																	And the pride of Assyria will be brought down 
																	And the scepter of Egypt will depart. 
																	"And I will strengthen them in the LORD, 
																		And in His name they will walk," 
																		declares the LORD. 
												Open your doors, O Lebanon, 
																That a fire may feed on your cedars. 
												Wail, O cypress, 
															for the cedar has fallen, 
															Because the glorious *trees* have been destroyed; 
												Wail, O oaks of Bashan, 
														For the impenetrable forest has come down. 
												There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, 
														For their glory is ruined; 
														There is a sound of the young lions' roar, 
													For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. 
						Thus says the LORD my God, 
								"Pasture the flock 
										*doomed* to slaughter. 
										"Those who buy them 
													slay them and go unpunished, 
													and *each of* those 
																who sell them says, 
																			'Blessed be the LORD, 
																			for I have become rich!' 
													And their own shepherds have no pity on them. 
											"For I will no longer have pity 
													on the inhabitants of the land," 
													declares the LORD; 
					"but behold, I will cause the men to fall, 
							each into another's power 
							and into the power of his king; 
								and they will strike the land, 
								and I will not deliver *them* from their power." 
						So I pastured the flock 
									*doomed* to slaughter, 
									hence the afflicted of the flock. 
									And I took for myself two staffs: 
												the one I called Favor 
												and the other I called Union; 
						so I pastured the flock. 
									Then I annihilated the three shepherds 
											in one month, 
											for my soul was impatient with them, 
											and their soul also was weary of me. 
											Then I said, "I will not pasture you. 
													What is to die, let it die, 
														and what is to be annihilated, 
														let it be annihilated; 
														and let those who are left 
														eat one another's flesh." 
										I took my staff Favor 
													and cut it in pieces, 
													to break my covenant 
																which I had made with all the peoples. 
													So it was broken on that day, 
																and thus the afflicted of the flock 
																who were watching me 
																			realized that it was the word of the LORD. 
																			I said to them, 
																					"If it is good in your sight, 
																					give *me* my wages; 
																					but if not, never mind!" 
																					So they weighed out thirty *shekels* of silver as my wages. 
																	Then the LORD said to me, 
																				"Throw it to the potter, 
																					*that* magnificent price 
																								at which I was valued by them." 
																	So I took the thirty *shekels* of silver 
																			and threw them to the potter 
																					in the house of the LORD. 
																Then I cut in pieces 
																my second staff Union, 
																				to break the brotherhood 
																						between Judah and Israel. 
													The LORD said to me, 
																"Take again for yourself 
																	the equipment of a foolish shepherd. 
																	"For behold, 
																	I am going to raise up a shepherd 
																			in the land 
																			who will not care for the perishing, 
																			seek the scattered, 
																			heal the broken, 
																			or sustain the one standing, 
																			but will devour the flesh of the fat *sheep* and tear off their hoofs. 
																		"Woe to the worthless shepherd 
																					Who leaves the flock! 
																					A sword will be on his arm 
																					And on his right eye! 
																					His arm will be totally withered 
																					And his right eye will be blind." 

The burden of the word of the LORD 
		concerning Israel. 
		*Thus* declares the LORD 
					who stretches out the heavens, 
					lays the foundation of the earth, 
					and forms the spirit of man within him, 
				"Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem 
						a cup that causes reeling 
						to all the peoples around; 
						and when the siege is against Jerusalem, 
						it will also be against Judah. 
					"It will come about 
							in that day 
									that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone 
									for all the peoples; 
									all who lift it will be severely injured. 
									And all the nations of the earth 
									will be gathered against it. 
							"In that day," declares the LORD, 
									"I will strike every horse with bewilderment 
									and his rider with madness. 
									But I will watch over the house of Judah, 
											while I strike every horse of the peoples 
													with blindness. 
								"Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 
									'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
											through the LORD of hosts, their God.' 
							"In that day 
									I will make the clans of Judah 
											like a firepot 
											among pieces of wood 
											and a flaming torch among sheaves, 
											so they will consume on the right hand 
											and on the left all the surrounding peoples, 
												while the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
												again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. 
									"The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, 
														so that the glory of the house of David 
												and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem 
												will not be magnified above Judah. 
								"In that day 
											the LORD will defend 
													the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
													and the one who is feeble among them 
													in that day will be like David, 
													and the house of David *will be* like God, 
													like the angel of the LORD before them. 
								"And in that day 
											I will set about 
													to destroy all the nations 
															that come against Jerusalem. 
														"I will pour out on the house of David 
														and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
													the Spirit of grace 
													and of supplication, 
															so that they will look on Me 
																		whom they have pierced; 
																		and they will mourn for Him, 
																		as one mourns for an only son, 
																		and they will weep bitterly over Him 
																		like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. 
												"In that day 
																there will be great mourning 
in Jerusalem,
																like the mourning of Hadadrimmon 
																		in the plain of Megiddo. 
															"The land will mourn, 
																		every family by itself; 
															the family of the house of David 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															the family of the house of Nathan 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															the family of the house of Levi 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															the family of the Shimeites 
																		by itself 
																	and their wives 
																		by themselves; 
															all the families 
																	that remain, 
																		every family 
																			by itself 
																		and their wives 
																			by themselves. 
													"In that day 
															a fountain will be opened 
																	for the house of David and 
																	for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
																	for sin and for impurity. 
													"It will come about in that day," 
																declares the LORD of hosts, 
																	"that I will cut off 
																		the names of the idols 
																		from the land, 
																			and they 
																			will no longer be remembered; 
																	and I will also remove the prophets 
																	and the unclean spirit 
																	from the land. 
																	"And if anyone still prophesies, 
																			then his father and mother 
																					who gave birth to him 
																					will say to him, 
																						'You shall not live, 
																								for you have spoken 
																									falsely 
																								in the name of the LORD'; 
																					and his father and mother 
																						who gave birth to him 
																								will pierce him through 
																									when he prophesies. 
																					"Also it will come about 
																	in that day 
																			that the prophets 
																			will each be ashamed 
																			of his vision when he prophesies, 
																			and they will not put on 
																			a hairy robe 
																				in order to deceive; 
																			but he will say, 
																			'I am not a prophet; 
																					I am a tiller of the ground, 
																					for a man sold me 
																					as a slave in my youth.' 
																					"And one will say to him, 
																						'What are these wounds
                                            between your arms?' 
  																	Then he will say, 
    																	'*Those* with which I was wounded 
    																		in the house of my friends.' 
"Awake, O sword, 
		against My Shepherd, 
			And against the man, 
					My Associate," 
						Declares the LORD of hosts. 
				"Strike the Shepherd 
			that the sheep may be scattered; 
			And I will turn My hand against the little ones. 
		"It will come about in all the land," 
			Declares the LORD, 
		"That two parts in it will be cut off *and* perish; 
		But the third will be left in it. 
			"And I will bring the third part through the fire, 
			Refine them 
				as silver is refined, 
			And test them 
				as gold is tested. 
			They will call on My name, 
				And I will answer them; 
					I will say, 'They are My people,' 
				And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'" 

Behold, a day is coming for the LORD 
		when the spoil taken from you 
		will be divided among you. 
	For I will gather all the nations 
		against Jerusalem 
			to battle, 
				and the city will be captured, 
				the houses plundered, 
				the women ravished 
				and half of the city exiled, 
				but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. 
			Then the LORD will go forth 
					and fight 
					against those nations, 
							as when He fights on a day of battle. 
						In that day 
							His feet will stand 
							on the Mount of Olives, 
										which is in front of Jerusalem 
													on the east; 
						and the Mount of Olives 
								will be split in its middle 
											from east to west 
								by a very large valley, 
										so that half of the mountain 
											will move toward the north 
											and the other half toward the south. 
									You will flee 
											by the valley of My mountains, 
												for the valley of the mountains 
												will reach to Azel; 
									yes, you will flee 
												just as you fled before the earthquake 
												in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. 

Then the LORD, my God, will come, 
	*and* all the holy ones with Him! 
	In that day 
			there will be no light; 
					the luminaries will dwindle. 
			For it will be a unique day 
					which is known to the LORD, 
					neither day nor night, 
					but it will come about 
					that at evening time 
					there will be light. 
	And in that day 
			living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, 
						half of them 
									toward the eastern sea 
						and the other half 
									toward the western sea; 

`Zechariah 14:8-11 And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. (9) And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be the only one, and His name the only one... People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security.
Isaiah 11:9-10 They will not hurt or destroy in all My holy mountain, For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD As the waters cover the sea. (10) Then in that day The nations will resort to the root of Jesse, Who will stand as a signal for the peoples; And His resting place will be glorious.
Isaiah 60:18-20 No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise. (19) The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory. (20) Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.`

​			it will be in summer 
​			as well as in winter. `what does this mean? does it happen in summer and winter simultaneously? Probably not since Jerusalem is the center? This is probably referring to the amount of time...lingering on from summer and going into the winter.`
​		And the LORD will be king 
​			over all the earth; 
​		in that day 
​			the LORD will be *the only* one, 
​			and His name *the only* one. 
​			All the land will be changed 
​					into a plain 
​							from Geba 
​							to Rimmon 
​							south of Jerusalem; 
​					but Jerusalem will rise 
​									and remain on its site 
​									from Benjamin's Gate 
​									as far as the place 
​											of the First Gate 
​											to the Corner Gate, 
​									and from the Tower of Hananel 
​											to the king's wine presses. 
​							People will live in it, 
​								and there will no longer be a curse, 
​								for Jerusalem will dwell in security. 

Now this will be the plague 
	with which the LORD 
	will strike all the peoples 
	who have gone to war 
		against Jerusalem; 
					their flesh will rot 
							while they stand on their feet, 
					and their eyes will rot 
							in their sockets, 
					and their tongue will rot 
							in their mouth. 
It will come about in that day 
	that a great panic 
				from the LORD 
				will fall on them; `against those who have gone against Jerusalem`
				and they will seize one another's hand, 
				and the hand of one will be lifted 
				against the hand of another. 
	Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; 
			and the wealth of all the surrounding nations 
			will be gathered, 
				gold 
				and silver 
				and garments 
						in great abundance. 

So also like this plague 
	will be the plague 
			on the horse, 
			the mule, 
			the camel, 
			the donkey 
			and all the cattle 
			that will be in those camps. 

Then it will come about 
		that any 
				who are left of all the nations 
				that went against Jerusalem 
			will go up from year to year 
					to worship 
							the King, 
							the LORD of hosts, 
					and to celebrate 
							the Feast of Booths. 
						And it will be that 
						whichever of the families 
							of the earth 
									does not go up to Jerusalem 
											to worship 
												the King, 
												the LORD of hosts, 
														there will be no rain on them. 
										If the family of Egypt 
												does not go up or enter, 
														then no *rain will fall* on them; 
		it will be the plague 
			with which the LORD 
				smites the nations 
					who do not go up 
							to celebrate 
										the Feast of Booths. 
						This will be the punishment 
								of Egypt, 
						and the punishment 
								of all the nations 
						who do not go up 
								to celebrate the Feast of Booths. `When God gave the law, he commanded that Israel should live in tents or booths during the feast on the seventh month (Tishri). Nehemiah 8:14`
`For seven days, starting the fifteenth day of the seventh month Israel was to have a feast. During this time, they were to dwell in tents or booths. Leviticus 23:16, 34 This was a feast of celebration after the harvest was gathered. Deuteronomy 16:13`
`This feast is mentioned in Zechariah 3 times and only near the end of chapter 14. Zechariah 14:16, 18-19`
`The feast of booths/tabernacles was celebrated after the harvest. During the Millenial reign of Christ, not only will Israel but all of the nations will come to celebrate the great havest of souls. This may be the connection with the 70 bulls that were sacrificed and symbolized the 70 Gentiles nations of Genesis 10. Numbers 29:12-34`

In that day 
		there will *be inscribed* 
			on the bells of the horses, 
						"HOLY TO THE LORD." 
			And the cooking pots 
			in the LORD'S house 
						will be like the bowls before the altar. 
						Every cooking pot 
								in Jerusalem and in Judah 
								will be holy to the LORD of hosts; 
		and all who sacrifice 
				will come 
				and take of them 
				and boil in them. 
		And there will no longer be a Canaanite
		in the house of the LORD of hosts 
		in that day.
		'What a strange last statement to make before finishing up the fulfillment of God's promises. Surely this had to be hopeful news, but why? Why are the Canaanites singled out?

# Zechariah



(Chronology + Conversation)

In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo saying, 

> "The LORD was very angry with your fathers. "Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return to Me," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I may return to you," says the LORD of hosts. "Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Return now from your evil ways and from your evil deeds."' But they did not listen or give heed to Me," declares the LORD. "Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? "But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your fathers? Then they repented and said, 'As the LORD of hosts purposed to do to us in accordance with our ways and our deeds, so He has dealt with us.'"'" 

On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. 

Then I said, 
> "My lord, what are these?" 

And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, 
>"I will show you what these are." 

And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, 
>"These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth." 

So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, 
>"We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet." 

Then the angel of the LORD said, 

> "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?" 

The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words. So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, 

> "Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. "But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster." 'Therefore thus says the LORD, "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem."' "Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."'" 

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, *there were* four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, 

> "What are these?" 

And he answered me, 

> "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem." 

Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, 

> "What are these coming to do?" 

And he said, 
> "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these *craftsmen* have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up *their*horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it." 

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, *there was* a man with a measuring line in his hand. So I said, 

> "Where are you going?" 

And he said to me, 

> "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is." 

And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, 

> "Run, speak to that young man, saying, 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. 'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"  "Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD. "Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon." For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. "For behold, I will wave My hand over them so that they will be plunder for their slaves. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. "Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD. "Many nations will join themselves to the LORD in that day and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. "The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation." 

Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, 

> "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" 

Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, 

> "Remove the filthy garments from him." Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes." 

Then I said, 

> "Let them put a clean turban on his head." 

So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, 

> "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing *here.* 'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. 'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 'In that day,' declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to *sit* under *his* vine and under *his* fig tree.'" 

Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, 

> "What do you see?" 

And I said, 

> "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side." 

Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, 

> "What are these, my lord?" 

So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, 

> "Do you not know what these are?" 

And I said, 

> "No, my lord." 

Then he said to me, 

> "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts. 'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel *you will become* a plain; and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of "Grace, grace to it!"'" 

Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

> "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish *it.* Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. "For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—*these are* the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth." 

Then I said to him, 

> "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?" And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden *oil* from themselves?" So he answered me, saying, "Do you not know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord." 

Then he said, 

> "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth." 

Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, *there was* a flying scroll. And he said to me, 

> "What do you see?" 

And I answered, 
>"I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits." 

Then he said to me, 

> "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. "I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones." 

Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, 

> "Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth." 

I said, 

> "What is it?" 

And he said, 

> "This is the ephah going forth." Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah." Then he said, "This is Wickedness!" 

And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. 

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. 

I said to the angel who was speaking with me, 

> "Where are they taking the ephah?" 

Then he said to me, 

> "To build a temple for her in the land of Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there on her own pedestal." 

Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; and the mountains *were* bronze mountains. With the first chariot *were* red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. 

Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, 

> "What are these, my lord?" 

The angel replied to me, 

> "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; and the white ones go forth after them, while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. "When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth." And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. 

Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, 

> "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north." 

The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, 

> "Take *an offering* from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. "Take silver and gold, make an *ornate* crown and set *it*on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. " Then say to him, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. "Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."' "Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. "Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD." 

Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. 

In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth *day* of the ninth month, *which is* Chislev. Now *the town of* Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, 

> "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?" 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 

> "Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? 'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? 'Are not *these* the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'" 

Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,  

> "Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.' "But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. "They made their hearts *like* flint so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. "And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts; "but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, 

> "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.' "Thus says the LORD, 'I will return to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts *will be called* the Holy Mountain.' "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Old men and old women will again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each man with his staff in his hand because of age.  'And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in its streets.' "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'If it is too difficult in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too difficult in My sight?' declares the LORD of hosts. "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Behold, I am going to save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the west; and I will bring them *back* and they will live in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.' "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Let your hands be strong, you who are listening in these days to these words from the mouth of the prophets, *those* who *spoke* in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, to the end that the temple might be built. 'For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for animal; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace because of his enemies, and I set all men one against another. 'But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,' declares the LORD of hosts. 'For *there will be* peace for the seed: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these *things.* 'It will come about that just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you that you may become a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.' "For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear! 'These are the things which you should do: speak the truth to one another; judge with truth and judgment for peace in your gates. 'Also let none of you devise evil in your heart against another, and do not love perjury; for all these are what I hate,' declares the LORD." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 

> "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'The fast of the fourth, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth *months* will become joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts for the house of Judah; so love truth and peace.' "Thus says the LORD of hosts, '*It will* yet *be* that peoples will come, even the inhabitants of many cities. 'The inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, "Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts; I will also go." 'So many peoples and mighty nations will come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD.' "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 'In those days ten men from all the nations will grasp the garment of a Jew, saying, "Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you."'" The burden of the word of the LORD is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place (for the eyes of men, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the LORD), And Hamath also, which borders on it; Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. For Tyre built herself a fortress And piled up silver like dust, And gold like the mire of the streets. Behold, the Lord will dispossess her And cast her wealth into the sea; And she will be consumed with fire. Ashkelon will see *it* and be afraid. Gaza too will writhe in great pain; Also Ekron, for her expectation has been confounded. Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon will not be inhabited. And a mongrel race will dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. And I will remove their blood from their mouth And their detestable things from between their teeth. Then they also will be a remnant for our God, And be like a clan in Judah, And Ekron like a Jebusite. But I will camp around My house because of an army, Because of him who passes by and returns; And no oppressor will pass over them anymore, For now I have seen with My eyes. Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout *in triumph,* O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim And the horse from Jerusalem; And the bow of war will be cut off. And He will speak peace to the nations; And His dominion will be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of *My* covenant with you, I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. Return to the stronghold, O prisoners who have the hope; This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you. For I will bend Judah as My bow, I will fill the bow with Ephraim. And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece; And I will make you like a warrior's sword. Then the LORD will appear over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the trumpet, And will march in the storm winds of the south. The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink *and*be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a *sacrificial*basin, *Drenched* like the corners of the altar. And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For *they are as* the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty *will be* theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to *each* man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain. Therefore *the people* wander like sheep, They are afflicted, because there is no shepherd. "My anger is kindled against the shepherds, And I will punish the male goats; For the LORD of hosts has visited His flock, the house of Judah, And will make them like His majestic horse in battle. "From them will come the cornerstone, From them the tent peg, From them the bow of battle, From them every ruler, *all*of them together. "They will be as mighty men, Treading down *the enemy*in the mire of the streets in battle; And they will fight, for the LORD *will be* with them; And the riders on horses will be put to shame. "I will strengthen the house of Judah, And I will save the house of Joseph, And I will bring them back, Because I have had compassion on them; And they will be as though I had not rejected them, For I am the LORD their God and I will answer them. "Ephraim will be like a mighty man, And their heart will be glad as if *from* wine; Indeed, their children will see *it* and be glad, Their heart will rejoice in the LORD. "I will whistle for them to gather them together, For I have redeemed them; And they will be as numerous as they were before. "When I scatter them among the peoples, They will remember Me in far countries, And they with their children will live and come back. "I will bring them back from the land of Egypt And gather them from Assyria; And I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon Until no *room* can be found for them. "And they will pass through the sea *of* distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. "And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious *trees* have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock *doomed* to slaughter. "Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and *each of* those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!' And their own shepherds have no pity on them. "For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of the land," declares the LORD; "but behold, I will cause the men to fall, each into another's power and into the power of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver *them* from their power." So I pastured the flock *doomed* to slaughter, hence the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favor and the other I called Union; so I pastured the flock. Then I annihilated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also was weary of me. Then I said, "I will not pasture you. What is to die, let it die, and what is to be annihilated, let it be annihilated; and let those who are left eat one another's flesh." I took my staff Favor and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. So it was broken on that day, and thus the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realized that it was the word of the LORD. I said to them, "If it is good in your sight, give *me* my wages; but if not, never mind!" So they weighed out thirty *shekels* of silver as my wages. 

Then the LORD said to me, 

> "Throw it to the potter, *that* magnificent price at which I was valued by them." 

So I took the thirty *shekels* of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 

The LORD said to me, 

> "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. "For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing, seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing, but will devour the flesh of the fat *sheep* and tear off their hoofs. "Woe to the worthless shepherd Who leaves the flock! A sword will be on his arm And on his right eye! His arm will be totally withered And his right eye will be blind." 

The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. *Thus* declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, 

> "Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. "It will come about in that day that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who lift it will be severely injured. And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. "In that day," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. "Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.' "In that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. "The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. "In that day the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David *will be* like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. "And in that day I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. "I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. "In that day there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. "The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. "In that day a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. "It will come about in that day," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. "And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. "Also it will come about in that day that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.' "And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say, '*Those* with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.' "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. "It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off *and* perish; But the third will be left in it. "And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'" Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. In that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, *and* all the holy ones with Him! In that day there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. And in that day living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; in that day the LORD will be *the only* one, and His name *the only* one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. It will come about in that day that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no *rain will fall* on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. In that day there will *be inscribed* on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD." And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts in that day.

Message #1 - God says, "Return to ME!"

`- *(Year 2, month 8 of Darius)*`

In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, `520BC. dates are given based on the ruling gentile king. There is no king of Israel or Judah at this time. Zerubbabel is governor. The line of David is off the throne, and the Times of the Gentiles are in progress. (Luke 21:24, Rom 11:25). The eighth month was called Bul (1 Kings 6:38) but after exile evidently Marcheshvan - "rainy" (Josephus).`

the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, `“The second year of Darius” is the same year in which Haggai prophesied. Haggai was given a prophecy in September (to begin rebuilding temple), October (Hag 2), and December, but none in November. So this man Zechariah was given a prophecy in November, the month Haggai missed. Two months before this message, they had began to rebuild the temple. One month before, they were discouraged. Haggai gave them an encouraging message of hope (Hag 2). - Zechariah is mentioned as head of the family (Neh 12:4++). This means in 520 Zechariah was probably a young man. Zechariah was a prophet - this was his rank.`

the son of Berechiah, `(Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - Yahweh blesses`

We don't know much about Berechiah, the __<u>fa</u>__ther of Zechariah.

##### a. Jesus menciona a un profeta martirizado llamado Zaracías hijo de Berequías en Mat 23:35. Lucas no lo menciona. Luc 11:51, 2 Cró 24:20-22. Es __<u>dificil</u>__ saber con certeza. 

###### i. Opción 1: Berequias significa lo __<u>mismo</u>__ que Jehoiada.

###### ii. Opción 2: Berequías era el padre mientras que Jehoiada era su __<u>abuelo</u>__.

###### iii. Opción 3: Jesus era testigo del asesinato de Zacarías al igual que __<u>Abel</u>__.

###### 		- Matthew was familiar with Zechariah. In fact he quotes it three times. The fact that Jesus mentions Zechariah of Berechiah as a martyr would have surprised Matthew and therefore he noted it. Zechariah 9:9, 11:13, 13:7

###### iv. Option 4: __<u>Error</u>__ in transcription'

the son of Iddo saying, `(Zechariah 1:1, Zechariah 1:7) - grandfather of Zechariah. One of the priests/levites who returned from Babylon (Neh 12:4, Neh 12:16)`

The Lord of hosts would return to be theirs upon their return to HIM, not to the land! Q: were the people thinking all was well because they were back in the land? Once they rebuilt the temple, would they think God had returned to them? Was their religion what God looked for?`

Zechariah is appealing to the people...look what happened when God (through the prophets of old) was not listened to. Now listen to God as He speaks through me.`

| SUMMARY NOTE: |
|:--|
|`Were Haggai and Zechariah effective? Did the people listen? Ezra says thanks to them the temple was rebuilt: "Ezr 6:14  And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."`|

Message #2 - Zechariah received a series of visions

`- *(Year 2, month 11 [Shebat] of Darius)* In a series of eight night visions, God explains His involvement with His people.`

**Vision #1 - The Horseman**

`God watches the nations. God will rebuild Jerusalem and the temple`

On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, 

which is the month Shebat, `the month is named this time. Is there a reason?`

in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows: 

I saw at night, `a vision at night`

and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, `No explanation is given as tot he colours of the horses. a red horse, is it death, war?`

and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, `Myrtle trees are seen as blessing from God in Isaiah 55:1-13. God will turn briars into myrtle trees.  The fact that this rider is standing among myrtle trees in the ravine speaks of blessing.`

with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. `red horse, sorrel (brown), white horses`

Then I said, 

> "My lord, what are these?" `An angel was also there`

And the angel who was speaking with me said to me, `This angel is similar to Gabriel who came to explain the meaning of the visions`

>"I will show you what these are." `The interpreting angel says, "i will show you. I will explain to you"`

And the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered and said, `now the man on the red horse speaks`

>"These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth." `Are there always those patroling the earth? Is this a one-time event?`

So they answered the angel of the LORD who was standing among the myrtle trees and said, `they? The red horse and white horses? Angel of the Lord, man on the red horse, man standing among the myrtle trees. Same person?` 

`THE ANGEL OF THE LORD: (6x in Zechariah). This “man among the myrtle trees” was the Angel of the Lord (vv. 11–13), the second Person of the Godhead, who in Old Testament times made temporary preincarnate appearances on earth. As the Angel of the Lord, the Son of God appeared to `
`Hagar (Gen. 16:7–14), `
`Abraham (18; 22:11–18), `
`Jacob (31:11, 13), `
`Moses (Ex. 3), `
`Gideon (Judg. 6:11–23), `
`Samson’s parents (Judg. 13).`

>"We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is peaceful and quiet." `These horsemen answer to the angel of the Lord. When is the earth peaceful and quiet? In relation to what? Evidently in relation to the defense/prosperity of Jerusalem. The nations were at ease.This is wrong since the Jews are not in the land. `  

Then the angel of the LORD said, 

> "O LORD of hosts, how long will You have no compassion for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant these seventy years?" `The Angel of the Lord answers to God the Father. In this case he intercedes for the people..."how long?". The events of the vision take place after the 70 years in exile. The expectation is the reconquering (compassion) of the land. `
>
> `For centuries, “How long?” has been the cry of suffering people, especially the people of Israel (Ps. 74:9–10; 79:5; 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 1:2). “How long?” is even the cry of the martyred saints in heaven (Rev. 6:10). That the Son of God should so identify Himself with the cries of His people reveals His compassion and concern. “In all their distress he too was distressed” (Isa. 63:9 niv).- wiersbe`

The LORD answered the angel who was speaking with me with gracious words, comforting words.`Zechariah makes mention of the mercy in the Lord's words. This is the nature of all prophecy. IT is to bring hope and comfort to the reader.`

 So the angel who was speaking with me said to me, `this is the interpreting angel. `

> "Proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, `this was to be what Zechariah was to tell the people. "NOTICE: proclaim...the message God gave him"`
>
> > "I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and Zion. `Jerusalem and Zion are distinguished here. Possibly the city vs the holy mountain Psa 2:6, Isa 10:32, Mic 3:12, Mic 4:1-2` 
> >
> > "But I am very angry with the nations who are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster." `The Lord said this would happen and had even promised to punish the Chaldeans for their harsh treatment of the Jews. HAB 2:8`
> >
> > 'Therefore thus says the LORD, 
> >
> > > "I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be built in it," declares the LORD of hosts, "and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem."' `what is a measuring line? You can't measure something that isn't there. My house (temple #2) will be built. Zechariah 4:10 `
> > >
> > > "Again, proclaim, saying, 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
> > >
> > > > "My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the LORD will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem."'" `The Lord of hosts is promising to bring overflowing prosperity to the cities of Judah, especially Jerusalem`

**Vision #2 - Four Horns**

`God concerns himself with the four gentile nations  who have risen against Israel and Judah`

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, *there were* four horns. So I said to the angel who was speaking with me, `horns are generally empires or powers`

> "What are these?" 

And he answered me, 

> "These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem." `four horns, IF ISRAEL and if this deals with the period up to that time, then (Egypt, Assyria, Babylon and Medo-Persia?). If 4 horns of Daniel and after 70x7 then it deals with the 4 horns from the times of the Gentiles starting with Babylon. A key interpretive phrase is "have scattered..."Does this deal with Zechariah's past or from Zechariah's vision's past? `

Then the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I said, `Zechariah was shown 4 craftsmen. What are craftsmen? 1. Blacksmiths 2. Carpenters 3. Masons 4. Warriors 5. Jewelers. 2 Kings 22:6 distinguishes craftsmen from masons. 2 kings 24:16 mentions "1000 craftsmen...strong and fit for war". 2 Chr 24:12 mentions craftsmen who were hired to rebuild the temple. Isa 40:19-20 connects craftsmen to idol makers. Isa 54:16 God makes the smith (craftsmen) to form the weapons out of iron. Nebuchadnezzar took all the crafstmen to Babylon. Eze 21:31 seems to refer to craftsmen as leaders, brutal men skilled in destruction. It does appear at first glance that God wants Zechariah to know the four horns are dealt with so as to not be discouraged.`

> "What are these coming to do?" `It is good when Zechariah asks questions for us becuase he generally gets an answer. He asks not who are they but what are they coming to do, so Zechariah's curiosity is in regards to their purpose. If 70 years then these 4 craftsmen already came. If 70x7 then the 4 craftsmen could be during the tribulation?  `

And he said, `the interpreting angel`

> "These are the horns which have scattered Judah so that no man lifts up his head; but these *craftsmen* have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations who have lifted up *their* horns against the land of Judah in order to scatter it." `four craftsmen? What they're doing is answered: To terrify the four horns...to throw them down. Evidently their identity is not important. Their purpose and is.Psa 75:10`

**Vision #3 - The Man Measuring the Temple**

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, *there was* a man with a measuring line in his hand. `Similar scene to Rev 11 except this is in referince to the city not the temple.  ` 

So I said, 

> "Where are you going?" `Not what are you doing, but where are you going? The man seems to be walking away somewhere not evident to Zechariah, perhaps because at the time there was no city to speak of, it was in ruins.`

And he said to me, 

> "To measure Jerusalem, to see how wide it is and how long it is." `not measuring the temple as Rev 11 but Jersusalem. What was the state of Jerusalem at the time?"`

And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out, and another angel was coming out to meet him, and said to him, `what angel is going to measure with the man? Where is the angel 'coming out' from? Coming out from the city? ` 

`A note about the status of Jerusalem at this point in history:`
 `Jerusalem was destoyed: Jeremiah 26;18, 2 Chro 36:17-21, Eze 33:21 `

`Jerusalem will be rebuilt: `

`Temple will be rebuilt within 4 years (by the sixth year of king Darius): Ezra 6:14-15`
` under Zerubbabel:  2 Chr 36:22-23, Zechariah 4:9`

`Jerusalem walls rebuilt: Neh 2:3, Neh 2:17`

> "Run, speak to that young man, saying, `Zechariah is refered to as young man by the new angel.`
>
> > 'Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the multitude of men and cattle within it. 'For I,' declares the LORD, 'will be a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in her midst.'"  "Ho there! Flee from the land of the north," declares the LORD, "for I have dispersed you as the four winds of the heavens," declares the LORD. "Ho, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the daughter of Babylon." `The Lord will cause Jerusalem to be rebuilt (inhabited).2 Chr 36:22-23, Neh 2`
> >
> > For thus says the LORD of hosts, "After glory He has sent me against the nations which plunder you, for he who touches you, touches the apple of His eye. `Genesis 12`
> >
> > "For behold, I will wave My hand over them `THE NATIONS will feel the wave of the hand of God over them`
> >
> > so that they will be plunder for their slaves. `Calamity due to their slaves - the jews.`
> >
> > Then you `Judah`
> >
> > will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me. `Is Jesus speaking? It's no doubt when it happens. God did it. They would know it.`
> >
> > "Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for behold I am coming and I will dwell in your midst," declares the LORD. `Emanuel? God with us? John 1:14, Mat 4:13-17. This is true of the first coming but ultimately fullfiled in the second coming. As we see following... `
> >
> > "Many nations will join themselves to the LORD **in that day** and will become My people. Then I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent Me to you. `At first glance this could be refering to Jesus' first coming but it says (after the nations join), then I will dwell...this must then be referring to the second coming when Jesus comes and dwells for 1000 years in their midst. In that day...`
> >
> > "The LORD will possess Judah as His portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. `Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven, your kingdom come.`
> >
> > "Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused from His holy habitation."  `Isa 62:1-4`

**Vision #4 - Joshua the High Priest** 

`Joshua represents religious Israel. Will they receive God's servant when he is sent? Not initially. Matt 23:35`
`Ultimately though, they will have their dirty clothes removed. They will experience peace when "the Branch" rules`

Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. The LORD said to Satan, 

> "The LORD rebuke you, Satan! `the Lord said Satan. This must be Jesus rebuking Satan`
>
> Indeed, the LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! `Satan is not after Joshua, but who Joshua represents - Israel`
>
> Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?" 

Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel. He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, `Joshua represents the current state of Israel - clothed in filthy garments?`

> "Remove the filthy garments from him." Again he said to him, "See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you with festal robes." `This is so essential to the message of grace. It is God who must remove unrighteousness. As the prodigal son, God the father removes the filthy garments, puts on the royal ring and festive robes and celebrates his son. It is the father's doing, not the son's.`

Then I said, 

> "Let them put a clean turban on his head." `Perhaps the obvious next step, "don't forget the turban!!". Zechariah can't contain his excitement to see the filthy clothes removed and festive ones put on...`

So they `who, the angels?`

put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the LORD was standing by. And the angel of the LORD admonished Joshua, saying, 

> "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
>
> > 'If you will walk in My ways and if you will perform My service, then you will also govern My house and also have charge of My courts, and I will grant you free access among these who are standing *here.* `Notice must made to the words of the angel of the Lord here..."IF you will walk...then you will govern my house". The implication is that though the clothing was changed (a state of acceptance) conditions were put as to the condition of experience. governing the temple, charge of the courts and free access is granted only to him who walks in his ways, performing his service.`
> >
> > 'Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol, `"your friends" in other words, religious leaders - these the priests, pharisees, saducees?`
> >
> > for behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch. `clearly a reference to Messiah, Jesus. Jer 23:5, Luke 11:37-54. Eventually the Branch will build the temple. Zechariah 6:12-13`
> >
> > 'For behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes. `THis addition is very interesting..."before Joshua" the stone. The cornerstone.  The seven eyes of the Lamb? Rev 5:6`
> >
> > Behold, I will engrave an inscription on it,' declares the LORD of hosts, `inscription on the rock?`
> >
> > 'and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. '**In that day**,' `this is Messianic prophecy`
> >
> > declares the LORD of hosts, 'every one of you will invite his neighbor to *sit* under *his* vine and under *his* fig tree.'" `rest in the kingdom due to their iniquity being absolved. Having vines and fig trees ripe with fruit would be a sign of being in a state of blessing with God. Hab 3:17`

**Vision #5 - The Lampstand**

Then the angel who was speaking with me returned and roused me, as a man who is awakened from his sleep. He said to me, `Since the vision was at night, Zechariah needed to be roused to state was he saw.`

> "What do you see?" 

And I said, 

> "I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold with its bowl on the top of it, `a golden lampstand, a bowl and on top the seven candlesticks`
>
> and its seven lamps on it with seven spouts belonging to each of the lamps which are on the top of it; `Ex 25:37`
>
> also two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left side." 

Then I said to the angel who was speaking with me saying, 

> "What are these, my lord?" 

So the angel who was speaking with me answered and said to me, 

> "Do you not know what these are?" 

And I said, 

> "No, my lord." 

Then he said to me, `particular build-up for the reader to take notice of what is about to be explained`

> "This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel saying, `a specific message to Zerubbabel...`
>
> > 'Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,' says the LORD of hosts. `certainly contrary to those who say, "ease does not produce strength". Grace is what teaches us (Tit 2:11-12 ). WE are to be strenghtened by grace (Eph 6:10, 2 Tim 2:2)`
> >
> > 'What are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel *you will become* a plain; `nothing is too great the man who has God battling before him. The man who is God's instrument is limitless in power! Unstoppable! `
> >
> > and he will bring forth the top stone with shouts of  "Grace, grace to it!"'" `The top stone is the final stone of the building, hence Zerubbabel will finish the temple, but how? Not by might but by God's power! Shouts of grace, grace not Zerubba Zerubba. God's power, God's spirit glorifies God, not our strength but our shouts of Grace, grace, our trust in God our incopetence and utter dependance on God allows His Spirit to work and the evidence to show forth...God did it!`  

**Vision #6 - Two Annointed Ones**

Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

> "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands will finish *it.* Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. `Clearly obvious that God is fighting for them but through 'his hands'. Zerubbabel is being used to point people to God. `
>
> "For who has despised the day of small things? But these seven will be glad when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—`a plumb line is used for building. `
>
> *these are* the eyes of the LORD which range to and fro throughout the earth." `the seven eyes will see and be glad...Rev 5:6`

Then I said to him, 

> "What are these two olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?" `First he asks what are the olive TREES`
>
> And I answered the second time and said to him, "What are the two olive branches which are beside the two golden pipes, which empty the golden *oil* from themselves?" `Now he asks what are the olive BRANCHES. the two witnesses from Revelation?`

So he answered me, saying, 
>"Do you not know what these are?" 

And I said, 
>"No, my lord." 

Then he said, 
> "These are the two anointed ones who are standing by the Lord of the whole earth." `Lord of the whole earth - a reference to Christ. Rev 11:4`

Then I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, *there was* a flying scroll. And he said to me, 

> "What do you see?" 

And I answered, 

>"I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits." `the scroll that Christ opens in Rev 5?`

Then he said to me, 

> "This is the curse that is going forth over the face of the whole land; `tribulation?`
>
> surely everyone who steals will be purged away according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears will be purged away according to the writing on the other side. 
>
> "I will make it go forth," declares the LORD of hosts, "and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by My name; `the justice of God - he will make it go forth.`
>
> and it will spend the night within that house and consume it with its timber and stones." `total consumption`

Then the angel who was speaking with me went out and said to me, 

> "Lift up now your eyes and see what this is going forth." 

I said, 

> "What is it?" 

And he said, 

> "This is the ephah going forth." Again he said, "This is their appearance in all the land (and behold, a lead cover was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting inside the ephah." Then he said, "This is Wickedness!" `is this the harlot Babylon?`

And he threw her down into the middle of the ephah and cast the lead weight on its opening. `Rev 17-18?`

**Vision #7 - Two Winged Women serve 'her' to build a temple in Shinar**

Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there two women were coming out with the wind in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens. 

I said to the angel who was speaking with me, 

> "Where are they taking the ephah?" 

Then he said to me, 

> "To build a temple for her `the harlot Babylon`
>
> in the land of Shinar; `a return to Babel`
>
> and when it is prepared, `The temple`
>
> she will be set there on her own pedestal." `a temple will be built in Babylon`

**Vision #8 - Four Chariots**

Now I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming forth from between the two mountains; `the two mountains?`

and the mountains *were* bronze mountains. With the first chariot *were* red horses, with the second chariot black horses, with the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong dappled horses. `Very similar to the 4 horsemen in Revelation`

Then I spoke and said to the angel who was speaking with me, 

> "What are these, my lord?" `not where or who but what. Later we are told these respond to the angel of the Lord. Are they angels sent to patrol and appear to Zech as chariots? `

The angel replied to me, `not the angel of the Lord, but the interpreting angel`

> "These are the four spirits of heaven, going forth after standing before the Lord of all the earth, 
>
> with one of which the black horses are going forth to the north country; `drought? Famine?`
>
> and the white ones go forth after them, `false conquest? Antichrist?`
>
> while the dappled ones go forth to the south country. ``
>
> "When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth." 
>
> And He said, "Go, patrol the earth." So they patrolled the earth. 

Then He cried out to me and spoke to me saying, 

> "See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north." `does this imply repentance or justice served?`

The word of the LORD also came to me, saying, 

> "Take *an offering* from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah; and you go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon. 
>
> "Take silver and gold, make an *ornate* crown and set *it* on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. " `why would the high priest wear the crown?`
>
> Then say to him, 
>
> > 'Thus says the LORD of hosts, "Behold, a man whose name is Branch, for He will branch out from where He is; and He will build the temple of the LORD. "Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the LORD, and He who will bear the honor and sit and rule on His throne. Thus, He will be a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices."' "Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the LORD to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah. "Those who are far off will come and build the temple of the LORD." 

Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And it will take place if you completely obey the LORD your God. 

Message #3

`*(year 4, month 9 [Chislev] of Darius)*`

In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the LORD came to Zechariah on the fourth *day* of the ninth month, *which is* Chislev. 

Now *the town of* Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to seek the favor of the LORD, speaking to the priests who belong to the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, 

> "Shall I weep in the fifth month and abstain, as I have done these many years?" 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 

> "Say to all the people of the land and to the priests, 'When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months these seventy years, was it actually for Me that you fasted? 
>
> 'When you eat and drink, do you not eat for yourselves and do you not drink for yourselves? 'Are not *these* the words which the LORD proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous along with its cities around it, and the Negev and the foothills were inhabited?'" 

Then the word of the LORD came to Zechariah saying,  

> "Thus has the LORD of hosts said, 'Dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother; and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor; and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another.' 
>
> "But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing. 
>
> "They made their hearts *like* flint
>
>  so that they could not hear the law and the words which the LORD of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; 
>
> therefore great wrath came from the LORD of hosts. "And just as He called and they would not listen, so they called and I would not listen," says the LORD of hosts; 
>
> "but I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations whom they have not known. 
>
> Thus the land is desolated behind them so that no one went back and forth, for they made the pleasant land desolate." 

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, 

> "Thus says the LORD of hosts, 
>
> > 'I am exceedingly jealous for Zion, yes, with great wrath I am jealous for her.' "
>
> Thus says the LORD,

>
> For thus says the LORD of hosts, 
>
> > 'Just as I purposed to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to wrath,' says the LORD of hosts, 'and I have not relented, so I have again purposed in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear!

Burden #1

Then the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, 

> "Thus says the LORD of hosts,

The LORD of hosts will defend them. And they will devour and trample on the sling stones; And they will drink *and* be boisterous as with wine; And they will be filled like a *sacrificial* basin, *Drenched* like the corners of the altar.

> > And the LORD their God will save them in that day As the flock of His people; For *they are as* the stones of a crown, Sparkling in His land. For what comeliness and beauty *will be* theirs! Grain will make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. Ask rain from the LORD at the time of the spring rain—The LORD who makes the storm clouds; And He will give them showers of rain, vegetation in the field to *each* man. For the teraphim speak iniquity, And the diviners see lying visions And tell false dreams; They comfort in vain.

"And they will pass through the sea *of* distress And He will strike the waves in the sea, So that all the depths of the Nile will dry up; And the pride of Assyria will be brought down And the scepter of Egypt will depart. "And I will strengthen them in the LORD, And in His name they will walk," declares the LORD. Open your doors, O Lebanon, That a fire may feed on your cedars. Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, Because the glorious *trees* have been destroyed; Wail, O oaks of Bashan, For the impenetrable forest has come down. There is a sound of the shepherds' wail, For their glory is ruined; There is a sound of the young lions' roar, For the pride of the Jordan is ruined. Thus says the LORD my God, "Pasture the flock *doomed* to slaughter. "Those who buy them slay them and go unpunished, and *each of* those who sell them says, 'Blessed be the LORD, for I have become rich!'

Then the LORD said to me, 

> "Throw it to the potter, *that* magnificent price at which I was valued by them." 

So I took the thirty *shekels* of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 

Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. 

The LORD said to me, 

> "Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd. "For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land

Burden #2

The burden of the word of the LORD concerning Israel. 

*Thus* declares the LORD who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him, 

> "Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes reeling to all the peoples around; and when the siege is against Jerusalem, it will also be against Judah. "
>
> It will come about **in that day** that I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; 
>
> all who lift it will be severely injured. 
>
> And all the nations of the earth will be gathered against it. "
>
> **In that day**," declares the LORD, "I will strike every horse with bewilderment and his rider with madness. But I will watch over the house of Judah, while I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. "Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, 'A strong support for us are the inhabitants of Jerusalem through the LORD of hosts, their God.' "
>
> **In that day** I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among pieces of wood and a flaming torch among sheaves, so they will consume on the right hand and on the left all the surrounding peoples, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem again dwell on their own sites in Jerusalem. "The LORD also will save the tents of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not be magnified above Judah. "
>
> **In that day** the LORD will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them in that day will be like David, and the house of David *will be* like God, like the angel of the LORD before them. "
>
> And **in that day** I will set about to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. "I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of supplication, so that they will look on Me whom they have pierced; and they will mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only son, and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping over a firstborn. "
>
> **In that day** there will be great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the plain of Megiddo. "The land will mourn, every family by itself; the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself and their wives by themselves; all the families that remain, every family by itself and their wives by themselves. "
>
> **In that day** a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity. "
>
> It will come about **in that day**," declares the LORD of hosts, "that I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they will no longer be remembered; and I will also remove the prophets and the unclean spirit from the land. "And if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who gave birth to him will say to him, 'You shall not live, for you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD'; and his father and mother who gave birth to him will pierce him through when he prophesies. "
>
> Also it will come about **in that day** that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies, and they will not put on a hairy robe in order to deceive; but he will say, 'I am not a prophet; I am a tiller of the ground, for a man sold me as a slave in my youth.' "And one will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' Then he will say, '*Those* with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.' "Awake, O sword, against My Shepherd, And against the man, My Associate," Declares the LORD of hosts. "Strike the Shepherd that the sheep may be scattered; And I will turn My hand against the little ones. "It will come about in all the land," Declares the LORD, "That two parts in it will be cut off *and* perish; But the third will be left in it. "And I will bring the third part through the fire, Refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say, 'They are My people,' And they will say, 'The LORD is my God.'" Behold, a day is coming for the LORD when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you. For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured, the houses plundered, the women ravished and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city. Then the LORD will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle. 
>
> **In that day** His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south. You will flee by the valley of My mountains, for the valley of the mountains will reach to Azel; yes, you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the LORD, my God, will come, *and* all the holy ones with Him! 
>
> **In that day** there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle. For it will be a unique day which is known to the LORD, neither day nor night, but it will come about that at evening time there will be light. 
>
> And in **that day** living waters will flow out of Jerusalem, half of them toward the eastern sea and the other half toward the western sea; it will be in summer as well as in winter. And the LORD will be king over all the earth; 
>
> **in that day** the LORD will be *the only* one, and His name *the only* one. All the land will be changed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; but Jerusalem will rise and remain on its site from Benjamin's Gate as far as the place of the First Gate to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king's wine presses. People will live in it, and there will no longer be a curse, for Jerusalem will dwell in security. Now this will be the plague with which the LORD will strike all the peoples who have gone to war against Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongue will rot in their mouth. 
>
> It will come about **in that day** that a great panic from the LORD will fall on them; and they will seize one another's hand, and the hand of one will be lifted against the hand of another. Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered, gold and silver and garments in great abundance. So also like this plague will be the plague on the horse, the mule, the camel, the donkey and all the cattle that will be in those camps. Then it will come about that any who are left of all the nations that went against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths. And it will be that whichever of the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, there will be no rain on them. If the family of Egypt does not go up or enter, then no *rain will fall* on them; it will be the plague with which the LORD smites the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Booths. 
>
> **In that day** there will *be inscribed* on the bells of the horses, "HOLY TO THE LORD." And the cooking pots in the LORD'S house will be like the bowls before the altar. Every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the LORD of hosts; and all who sacrifice will come and take of them and boil in them. 
>
> And there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts **in that day**.
