1Pe 1:1  Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen
1Pe 1:2  according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.
Born Again to a Living Hope
1Pe 1:3  Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
1Pe 1:4  to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,
1Pe 1:5  who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
1Pe 1:6  In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials,
1Pe 1:7  so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ;
1Pe 1:8  and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory,
1Pe 1:9  obtaining as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.
1Pe 1:10  As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you made careful searches and inquiries,
1Pe 1:11  seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.
1Pe 1:12  It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.
Called to Be Holy
1Pe 1:13  Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
1Pe 1:14  As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,
1Pe 1:15  but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior;
1Pe 1:16  because it is written, "YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY."
1Pe 1:17  If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your stay on earth;
1Pe 1:18  knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,
1Pe 1:19  but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ.
1Pe 1:20  For He was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for the sake of you
1Pe 1:21  who through Him are believers in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
1Pe 1:22  Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart,
1Pe 1:23  for you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God.
1Pe 1:24  For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF,
1Pe 1:25  BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER." And this is the word which was preached to you.
1Pe 2:1  Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander,
1Pe 2:2  like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation,
1Pe 2:3  if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.
1Pe 2:4  And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God,
1Pe 2:5  you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
1Pe 2:6  For this is contained in Scripture: "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
1Pe 2:7  This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, "THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,"
1Pe 2:8  and, "A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this doom they were also appointed.
1Pe 2:9  But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;
1Pe 2:10  for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, but now you are THE PEOPLE OF GOD; you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.
1Pe 2:11  Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul.
1Pe 2:12  Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God in the day of visitation.
Submission to Authority
1Pe 2:13  Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority,
1Pe 2:14  or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right.
1Pe 2:15  For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.
1Pe 2:16  Act as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but use it as bondslaves of God.
1Pe 2:17  Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king.
1Pe 2:18  Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable.
1Pe 2:19  For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly.
1Pe 2:20  For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.
1Pe 2:21  For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,
1Pe 2:22  WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;
1Pe 2:23  and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously;
1Pe 2:24  and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed.
1Pe 2:25  For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
1Pe 3:1  In the same way, you wives, be submissive to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives,
1Pe 3:2  as they observe your chaste and respectful behavior.
1Pe 3:3  Your adornment must not be merely external—braiding the hair, and wearing gold jewelry, or putting on dresses;
1Pe 3:4  but let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.
1Pe 3:5  For in this way in former times the holy women also, who hoped in God, used to adorn themselves, being submissive to their own husbands;
1Pe 3:6  just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, and you have become her children if you do what is right without being frightened by any fear.
1Pe 3:7  You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honor as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.
Suffering for Righteousness' Sake
1Pe 3:8  To sum up, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kindhearted, and humble in spirit;
1Pe 3:9  not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.
1Pe 3:10  For, "THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE FROM EVIL AND HIS LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT.
1Pe 3:11  "HE MUST TURN AWAY FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; HE MUST SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT.
1Pe 3:12  "FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL."
1Pe 3:13  Who is there to harm you if you prove zealous for what is good?
1Pe 3:14  But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. AND DO NOT FEAR THEIR INTIMIDATION, AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,
1Pe 3:15  but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and reverence;
1Pe 3:16  and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.
1Pe 3:17  For it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing what is right rather than for doing what is wrong.
1Pe 3:18  For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, so that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;
1Pe 3:19  in which also He went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison,
1Pe 3:20  who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water.
1Pe 3:21  Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
1Pe 3:22  who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, after angels and authorities and powers had been subjected to Him.
1Pe 4:1  Therefore, since Christ has suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same purpose, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
1Pe 4:2  so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
1Pe 4:3  For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of sensuality, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties and abominable idolatries.
1Pe 4:4  In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them into the same excesses of dissipation, and they malign you;
1Pe 4:5  but they will give account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1Pe 4:6  For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, that though they are judged in the flesh as men, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.
1Pe 4:7  The end of all things is near; therefore, be of sound judgment and sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.
1Pe 4:8  Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.
1Pe 4:9  Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
1Pe 4:10  As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
1Pe 4:11  Whoever speaks, is to do so as one who is speaking the utterances of God; whoever serves is to do so as one who is serving by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Suffering as a Christian
1Pe 4:12  Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you;
1Pe 4:13  but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exultation.
1Pe 4:14  If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
1Pe 4:15  Make sure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;
1Pe 4:16  but if anyone suffers as a Christian, he is not to be ashamed, but is to glorify God in this name.
1Pe 4:17  For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
1Pe 4:18  AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER?
1Pe 4:19  Therefore, those also who suffer according to the will of God shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing what is right.
1Pe 5:1  Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed,
1Pe 5:2  shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid gain, but with eagerness;
1Pe 5:3  nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples to the flock.
1Pe 5:4  And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
1Pe 5:5  You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE.
1Pe 5:6  Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time,
1Pe 5:7  casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.
1Pe 5:8  Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
1Pe 5:9  But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world.
1Pe 5:10  After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.
1Pe 5:11  To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen.
Final Greetings
1Pe 5:12  Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!
1Pe 5:13  She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark.
1Pe 5:14  Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ.

=====Phrased

Peter, 
an apostle of Jesus Christ, 
To those 
who reside as aliens, 
scattered throughout 
Pontus, 
Galatia, 
Cappadocia, 
Asia, 
and Bithynia, 
who are chosen 
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, 
by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, 
to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: 
May grace and peace be yours 
in the fullest measure. 
Blessed be the God and Father 
of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who according to His great mercy 
has caused us to be born again 
to a living hope 
through the resurrection 
of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
to obtain an inheritance 
which is imperishable 
and undefiled 
and will not fade away, 
reserved in heaven for you, 
who are protected by the power of God 
through faith 
for a salvation 
ready to be revealed in the last time. 
In this you greatly rejoice, 
even though now for a little while, 
if necessary, 
you have been distressed by various trials, 
so that the proof of your faith, 
being more precious than gold 
which is perishable, 
even though tested by fire, 
may be found to result 
in praise 
and glory 
and honor 
at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
and though you have not seen Him, 
you love Him, 
and though you do not see Him now, 
but believe in Him, 
you greatly rejoice 
with joy inexpressible 
and full of glory, 
obtaining as the outcome of your faith 
the salvation of your souls. 
As to this salvation, 
the prophets 
who prophesied 
of the grace that would come to you 
made careful searches and inquiries, 
seeking to know what person 
or time the Spirit of Christ 
within them was indicating 
as He predicted the sufferings of Christ 
and the glories to follow. 
It was revealed to them 
that they were not serving themselves, 
but you, in these things 
which now have been announced to you 
through those 
who preached the gospel to you 
by the Holy Spirit 
sent from heaven—
things into which angels long to look. 
Therefore, 
prepare your minds for action, 
keep sober in spirit, 
fix your hope completely 
on the grace to be brought to you 
at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
As obedient children, 
do not be conformed to the former lusts 
which were yours in your ignorance, 
but like the Holy One who called you, 
be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; 
because it is written, 
"YOU SHALL BE HOLY, 
FOR I AM HOLY." 
If you address as Father the One 
who impartially judges 
according to each one's work, 
conduct yourselves in fear 
during the time of your stay on earth; 
knowing that you were not redeemed 
with perishable things 
like silver or gold 
from your futile way of life 
inherited from your forefathers, 
but with precious blood, 
as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, 
the blood of Christ. 
For He was foreknown 
before the foundation of the world, 
but has appeared in these last times 
for the sake of you 
who through Him are believers in God, 
who raised Him from the dead 
and gave Him glory, 
so that your faith and hope are in God. 
Since you have 
in obedience to the truth 
purified your souls 
for a sincere love of the brethren, 
fervently love one another 
from the heart, 
for you have been born again 
not of seed 
which is perishable 
but imperishable, 
that is, 
through the living and enduring word of God. 
For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, 
AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. 
THE GRASS WITHERS, 
AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, 
BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER." 
And this is the word 
which was preached to you. 
Therefore, 
putting aside all malice 
and all deceit 
and hypocrisy 
and envy 
and all slander, 
like newborn babies, 
long for the pure milk of the word, 
so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, 
if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord. 
And coming to Him 
as to a living stone 
which has been rejected by men, 
but is choice and precious in the sight of God, 
you also, 
as living stones, 
are being built up 
as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, 
to offer up spiritual sacrifices 
acceptable to God 
through Jesus Christ. 
For this is contained in Scripture: "BEHOLD, I LAY IN ZION A CHOICE STONE, A PRECIOUS CORNER stone, AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED." 
This precious value, then, is for you 
who believe; 
but for those who disbelieve, 
"THE STONE WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED, THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone," and, "A STONE OF STUMBLING AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE"; 
for they stumble 
because they are disobedient 
to the word, 
and to this doom they were also appointed. 
But you 
are A CHOSEN RACE, 
A royal PRIESTHOOD, 
A HOLY NATION, 
A PEOPLE 
FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, 
so that you may proclaim 
the excellencies of Him 
who has called you 
out of darkness 
into His marvelous light; 
for you once were NOT A PEOPLE, 
but now you are 
THE PEOPLE OF GOD; 
you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY, 
but now you have RECEIVED MERCY. 
Beloved, I urge you 
as aliens and strangers 
to abstain from fleshly lusts 
which wage war against the soul. 
Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, 
so that in the thing 
in which they slander you 
as evildoers, 
they may 
because of your good deeds, 
as they observe them, 
glorify God in the day of visitation. 
Submit yourselves 
for the Lord's sake 
to every human institution, 
whether to a king as the one in authority, 
or to governors as sent by him 
for the punishment of evildoers 
and the praise of those who do right. 
For such is the will of God 
that by doing right 
you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. 
Act as free men, 
and do not use your freedom 
as a covering for evil, 
but use it as bondslaves of God. 
Honor all people, 
love the brotherhood, 
fear God, 
honor the king. 
Servants, 
be submissive to your masters 
with all respect, 
not only to those 
who are good and gentle, 
but also to those 
who are unreasonable. 
For this finds favor, 
if for the sake of conscience 
toward God a person bears up 
under sorrows 
when suffering unjustly. 
For what credit is there if, 
when you sin and are harshly treated, 
you endure it with patience? 
But if when you do what is right 
and suffer for it 
you patiently endure it, 
this finds favor with God. 
For you have been called for this purpose, 
since Christ also suffered for you, 
leaving you an example 
for you to follow in His steps, 
WHO COMMITTED NO SIN, 
NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH; 
and while being reviled, 
He did not revile in return; 
while suffering, 
He uttered no threats, 
but kept entrusting Himself 
to Him who judges righteously;
and He Himself 
bore our sins 
in His body 
on the cross, 
so that we might 
die to sin 
and live to righteousness; 
for by His wounds you were healed. 
For you were continually straying like sheep, 
but now you have returned 
to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls. 
In the same way, you wives, 
be submissive 
to your own husbands 
so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, 
they may be won without a word 
by the behavior of their wives, 
as they observe 
your chaste and respectful behavior. 
Your adornment must not be merely external—
braiding the hair, 
and wearing gold jewelry, 
or putting on dresses; 
but let it be the hidden person of the heart, 
with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, 
which is precious in the sight of God. 
For in this way 
in former times 
the holy women also, 
who hoped in God, 
used to adorn themselves, 
being submissive to their own husbands; 
just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, 
calling him lord, 
and you have become her children 
if you do what is right 
without being frightened by any fear. 
You husbands in the same way, 
live with your wives 
in an understanding way, 
as with someone weaker, 
since she is a woman; 
and show her honor 
as a fellow heir of the grace of life, 
so that your prayers will not be hindered. 
To sum up, 
all of you be 
harmonious, 
sympathetic, 
brotherly, 
kindhearted, 
and humble in spirit; 
not returning evil for evil 
or insult for insult, 
but giving a blessing instead; 
for you were called 
for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. 
For, "THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE, 
TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS, 
MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE 
FROM EVIL 
AND HIS LIPS 
FROM SPEAKING DECEIT. 
"HE MUST TURN 
AWAY FROM EVIL 
AND DO GOOD; 
HE MUST SEEK PEACE 
AND PURSUE IT. 
"FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD 
ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS, 
AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER, 
BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD 
IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL." 
Who is there to harm you 
if you prove zealous for what is good? 
But even if you should suffer 
for the sake of righteousness, 
you are blessed. 
AND DO NOT FEAR 
THEIR INTIMIDATION, 
AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED, 
but sanctify Christ 
as Lord in your hearts, 
always being ready 
to make a defense 
to everyone 
who asks you to give an account 
for the hope that is in you, 
yet with gentleness 
and reverence; 
and keep a good conscience 
so that in the thing 
in which you are slandered, 
those who revile 
your good behavior 
in Christ 
will be put to shame. 
For it is better, 
if God should will it so, 
that you suffer 
for doing what is right 
rather than for doing what is wrong. 
For Christ also died for sins once for all, 
the just for the unjust, 
so that He might bring us to God, 
having been put to death in the flesh, 
but made alive in the spirit; 
in which also He went 
and made proclamation 
to the spirits now in prison, 
who once were disobedient, 
when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, 
during the construction of the ark, 
in which a few, 
that is, eight persons, 
were brought safely 
through the water. 
Corresponding to that, 
baptism now saves you—
not the removal of dirt from the flesh, 
but an appeal to God for a good conscience—
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, 
who is at the right hand of God, 
having gone into heaven, 
after angels 
and authorities 
and powers 
had been subjected to Him. 
Therefore, 
since Christ has suffered in the flesh, 
arm yourselves also with the same purpose, 
because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, 
so as to live the rest of the time in the flesh 
no longer for the lusts of men, 
but for the will of God. 
For the time already past is sufficient for you 
to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, 
having pursued 
a course of sensuality, 
lusts, 
drunkenness, 
carousing, 
drinking parties 
and abominable idolatries. 
In all this, 
they are surprised 
that you do not run with them 
into the same excesses of dissipation, 
and they malign you; 
but they will give account to Him 
who is ready to judge 
the living 
and the dead. 
For the gospel has 
for this purpose been preached 
even to those who are dead, 
that though they are judged 
in the flesh as men, 
they may live in the spirit 
according to the will of God. 
The end of all things is near; 
therefore, 
be of sound judgment 
and sober spirit 
for the purpose of prayer. 
Above all, 
keep fervent in your love 
for one another, 
because love covers a multitude of sins. 
Be hospitable 
to one another 
without complaint. 
As each one has received a special gift, 
employ it in serving one another 
as good stewards 
of the manifold grace of God. 
Whoever speaks, 
is to do so 
as one who is speaking the utterances of God; 
whoever serves 
is to do so as one 
who is serving by the strength which God supplies; 
so that in all things God may be glorified 
through Jesus Christ, 
to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. 
Beloved, do not be surprised 
at the fiery ordeal among you, 
which comes upon you 
for your testing, 
as though some strange thing were happening to you; 
but to the degree 
that you share the sufferings of Christ, 
keep on rejoicing, 
so that also at the revelation 
of His glory you may rejoice with exultation. 
If you are reviled for the name of Christ, 
you are blessed, 
because the Spirit of glory 
and of God rests on you. 
Make sure 
that none of you suffers 
as a murderer, 
or thief, 
or evildoer, 
or a troublesome meddler; 
but if anyone suffers as a Christian, 
he is not to be ashamed, 
but is to glorify God in this name. 
For it is time for judgment to begin 
with the household of God; 
and if it begins with us first, 
what will be the outcome for those 
who do not obey the gospel of God? 
AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY 
THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, 
WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER? Therefore, those also 
who suffer 
according to the will of God 
shall entrust their souls 
to a faithful Creator 
in doing what is right. 
Therefore, 
I exhort the elders among you, 
as your fellow elder 
and witness of the sufferings of Christ, 
and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, 
shepherd the flock of God among you, 
exercising oversight 
not under compulsion, 
but voluntarily, 
according to the will of God; 
and not for sordid gain, 
but with eagerness; 
nor yet as lording it 
over those allotted to your charge, 
but proving to be examples to the flock. 
And when the Chief Shepherd appears, 
you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 
You younger men, likewise, 
be subject to your elders; 
and all of you, 
clothe yourselves 
with humility toward one another, 
for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, 
BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. 
Therefore 
humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, 
that He may exalt you at the proper time, 
casting all your anxiety on Him, 
because He cares for you. 
Be of sober spirit, 
be on the alert. 
Your adversary, 
the devil, 
prowls around like a roaring lion, 
seeking someone to devour. 
But resist him, 
firm in your faith, 
knowing that the same experiences 
of suffering are being accomplished 
by your brethren 
who are in the world. 
After you have suffered for a little while, 
the God of all grace, 
who called you 
to His eternal glory in Christ, 
will Himself 
perfect, 
confirm, 
strengthen 
and establish you. 
To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen. 
Through Silvanus, 
our faithful brother (for so I regard him), 
I have written to you briefly, 
exhorting and testifying 
that this is the true grace of God. 
Stand firm in it! 
She who is in Babylon, 
chosen together with you, 
sends you greetings, 
and so does my son, Mark. 
Greet one another with a kiss of love. 
Peace be to you all 
who are in Christ.

```

### Special greetings

```markdown
May grace and peace be yours 
	in the fullest measure. 
Blessed be the God and Father 
	of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
who 
	according to His great mercy 
has caused us to be born again 
	to a living hope 
	through the resurrection of Jesus Christ 
	from the dead, 
to obtain 
	an inheritance 
		which is imperishable 
		and undefiled 
		and will not fade away, 
		reserved in heaven 
	for you, 
		who are protected 
		by the power of God 
		through faith 
		for a salvation 
			ready to be revealed in the last time. 
```

### Purpose of writing

```markdown
In this you greatly rejoice, 
even though now 
	for a little while, 
	if necessary, 
you have been distressed 
by various trials, 
	so that the proof 
		of your faith, 
			being more precious 
				than gold 
					which is perishable, 
		even though tested by fire, 
			may be found to result 
				in praise 
				and glory 
				and honor 
					at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
		and though you have not seen Him, 
			you love Him, 
		and though you do not see Him now, 
			but believe in Him, 
		you greatly rejoice 
			with joy inexpressible 
			and full of glory, 
				obtaining 
				as the outcome of your faith 
				the salvation of your souls. 
```

## Grace is revealed!

```markdown
As to this salvation, 
the prophets 
	who prophesied 
		of the grace 
		that would come to you 
	made careful searches and inquiries, 
	seeking to know 
		what person 
		or time 
		the Spirit of Christ 
			within them 
			was indicating 
			as He predicted 
				the sufferings of Christ 
				and the glories to follow. 
		It was revealed to them 
			that they were not serving themselves, 
			but you, 
				in these things 
				which now have been announced to you 
				through those 
					who preached the gospel to you 
					by the Holy Spirit 
					sent from heaven—
					things into which angels long to look. 
```

### Fix your hope on the coming grace

```markdown
Therefore, 
	prepare your minds 
		for action, 
			keep sober in spirit, 
			fix your hope completely 
				on the grace 
					to be brought 
						to you 
						at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 
```

#### Children

```markdown
As obedient children, 
	do not be conformed 
	to the former lusts 
		which were yours in your ignorance, 
	but like the Holy One 
	who called you, 
		be holy yourselves also 
		in all your behavior; 
			because it is written, 
			"YOU SHALL BE HOLY, 
			FOR I AM HOLY." 
If you address as Father 
	the One 
		who impartially judges 
		according to 
		each one's work, 
	conduct yourselves 
		in fear 
			during the time 
			of your stay 
			on earth; 
				knowing that you were not redeemed 
				with perishable things 
					like silver or gold 
				from your futile way of life 
					inherited from your forefathers, 
				but with precious blood, 
					as of a lamb 
						unblemished 
						and spotless, 
							the blood of Christ. 
For He [Christ]
	was foreknown 
		before the foundation of the world, 
	but has appeared in these last times 
		for the sake of you 
			who through Him 
			are believers in God, 
	who raised Him from the dead 
and gave Him glory, 
	so that 
		your faith 
		and hope 
		are in God. 
Since you have 
	in obedience 
	to the truth 
		purified your souls 
			for a sincere love 
				of the brethren, 
	fervently love 
		one another 
		from the heart, 
	for you have been born again 
		not of seed 
		which is perishable 
		but imperishable, 
		that is, 
			through 
				the living 
				and enduring 
				word of God. 
					For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, 
					AND ALL ITS GLORY 
					LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. 
					THE GRASS WITHERS, 
					AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, 
					BUT THE WORD 
					OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER." 
						And this is the word 
						which was preached to you.

  		even to those who are dead, 
  		that though they are judged 
  		in the flesh as men, 
  		they may live in the spirit 
  			according to the will of God. 
  			The end of all things is near; 
```

#### Serving one another in the Spirit

```markdown
therefore, 
  be 
  	of sound judgment 
  	and sober spirit 
  	for the purpose of prayer. 
  Above all, 
  	keep fervent 
  		in your love 
  			for one another, 
  			because love 
  				covers a multitude of sins. 
  Be 
  	hospitable 
  		to one another 
  		without complaint. 
  	As each one has received 
  		a special gift, 
  			employ it 
  				in serving one another 
  				as good stewards 
  					of the manifold grace of God. 
  	Whoever speaks, 
    	is to do so 
  		as one who is speaking 
  		the utterances of God; 
  	whoever serves 
    	is to do so 
    	as one 
  			who is serving 
  				by the strength 
  				which God supplies; 
  					so that in all things 
  						God may be glorified 
    						through Jesus Christ, 
    							to whom belongs the glory 
    								and dominion forever and ever. 
    									Amen. 
```

#### Testing

```markdown
Beloved, 
  do not be surprised 
  at the fiery ordeal among you, 
    which comes 
    	upon you 
    	for your testing, 
  as though some strange thing were happening to you; 
  but to the degree 
  	that you share 
  	the sufferings of Christ, 
  		keep on rejoicing, 
  		so that also at the revelation 
  		of His glory 
  		you may rejoice 
  		with exultation. 
  		If you 
  			are reviled 
  			for the name of Christ, 
  				you are blessed, 
  				because the Spirit 
  					of glory 
  					and of God 
  						rests on you. 
  Make sure that none of you 
  	suffers 
    	as a murderer, 
    	or thief, 
    	or evildoer, 
    	or a troublesome meddler; 
  	but if anyone suffers 
  		as a Christian, 
  			he is not to be ashamed, 
  			but is to glorify God 
  			in this name. 
  		For it is time 
  			for judgment to begin 
  				with the household of God; 
  				and if it begins with us first, 
  				what will be the outcome for those 
  				who do not obey the gospel of God? 
  			AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY 
  			THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED, 
  			WHAT WILL BECOME 
  			OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER? 
```

#### Title

```markdown
Therefore, 
those also 
	who suffer 
		according to the will of God 
	shall entrust their souls 
	to a faithful Creator 
	in doing what is right. 
```

### Instructions to elders 

```markdown
Therefore, 
I exhort the elders 
	among you, 
	as your fellow elder 
		and witness 
			of the sufferings of Christ, 
		and a partaker also 
			of the glory 
			that is to be revealed, 
shepherd 
	the flock of God 
		among you, 
		exercising oversight 
			not under compulsion, 
			but voluntarily, 
				according to the will of God; 
			and not for sordid gain, 
			but with eagerness; 
			nor yet as lording it 
			over those allotted to your charge, 
			but proving to be examples to the flock. 
			And when the Chief Shepherd appears, 
			you will receive 
			the unfading crown of glory. 
```

### Younger Men

```markdown
You younger men, likewise, 
	be subject to your elders; 
```

### Everyone

```markdown
and all of you, 
	clothe yourselves 
	with humility 
		toward one another, 
			for GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, 
			BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE. 
```

#### Title

```markdown
Therefore 
  humble yourselves 
  	under the mighty hand of God, 
  	that He may exalt you 
  		at the proper time, 
  	casting all your anxiety on Him, 
  	because He cares for you. 
  Be of sober spirit, 
  be on the alert. 
  	Your adversary, 
  		the devil, 
  			prowls around 
  				like a roaring lion, 
  				seeking someone to devour. 
  			But resist him, 
  				firm in your faith, 
  					knowing that 
  						the same experiences 
  						of suffering are being accomplished 
  						by your brethren 
  							who are in the world. 
  							After you have suffered 
  							for a little while, 
  								the God of all grace, 
  									who called you 
  									to His eternal glory 
  									in Christ, 
  									will Himself 
  										perfect, 
  										confirm, 
  										strengthen 
  										and establish you. 
  								To Him be dominion 
  								forever and ever. 
  								Amen. 
Through Silvanus, 
	our faithful brother 
	(for so I regard him), 
	I have written to you briefly, 
		exhorting 
		and testifying 
			that this is the true grace of God. 
			Stand firm in it! 
```

### Final greetings

```markdown
She who is in Babylon, 
	chosen together with you, 
	sends you greetings, 
		and so does my son, Mark. 
		Greet one another with a kiss of love. 
		Peace be to you all 
			who are in Christ.
```

		*and be sprinkled with His blood:* 

### *Special greetings*

*May grace and peace be yours* 
	*in the fullest measure.* 
*Blessed be the God and Father* 
	*of our Lord Jesus Christ,* 
*who* 
	*according to His great mercy* 
*has caused us to be born again* 
	*to a living hope* 
	*through the resurrection of Jesus Christ* 
	*from the dead,* 
*to obtain* 
	*an inheritance* 
		*which is imperishable* 
		*and undefiled* 
		*and will not fade away,* 
		*reserved in heaven* 
	*for you,* 
		*who are protected* 
		*by the power of God* 
		*through faith* 
		*for a salvation* 
			*ready to be revealed in the last time.* 

### *Purpose of writing*

*In this you greatly rejoice,* 
*even though now* 
	*for a little while,* 
	*if necessary,* 
*you have been distressed* 
*by various trials,* 
	*so that the proof* 
		*of your faith,* 
			*being more precious* 
				*than gold* 
					*which is perishable,* 
		*even though tested by fire,* 
			*may be found to result* 
				*in praise* 
				*and glory* 
				*and honor* 
					*at the revelation of Jesus Christ;* 
		*and though you have not seen Him,* 
			*you love Him,* 
		*and though you do not see Him now,* 
			*but believe in Him,* 
		*you greatly rejoice* 
			*with joy inexpressible* 
			*and full of glory,* 
				*obtaining* 
				*as the outcome of your faith* 
				*the salvation of your souls.* 

## *Grace is revealed!*

*As to this salvation,* 
*the prophets* 
	*who prophesied* 
		*of the grace* 
		*that would come to you* 
	*made careful searches and inquiries,* 
	*seeking to know* 
		*what person* 
		*or time* 
		*the Spirit of Christ* 
			*within them* 
			*was indicating* 
			*as He predicted* 
				*the sufferings of Christ* 
				*and the glories to follow.* 
		*It was revealed to them* 
			*that they were not serving themselves,* 
			*but you,* 
				*in these things* 
				*which now have been announced to you* 
				*through those* 
					*who preached the gospel to you* 
					*by the Holy Spirit* 
					*sent from heaven—*
					*things into which angels long to look.* 

### *Fix your hope on the coming grace*

*Therefore,* 
	*prepare your minds* 
		*for action,* 
			*keep sober in spirit,* 
			*fix your hope completely* 
				*on the grace* 
					*to be brought* 
						*to you* 
						*at the revelation of Jesus Christ.* 

#### *Children*

*As obedient children,* 
	*do not be conformed* 
	*to the former lusts* 
		*which were yours in your ignorance,* 
	*but like the Holy One* 
	*who called you,* 
		*be holy yourselves also* 
		*in all your behavior;* 
			*because it is written,* 
			*"YOU SHALL BE HOLY,* 
			*FOR I AM HOLY."* 
*If you address as Father* 
	*the One* 
		*who impartially judges* 
		*according to* 
		*each one's work,* 
	*conduct yourselves* 
		*in fear* 
			*during the time* 
			*of your stay* 
			*on earth;* 
				*knowing that you were not redeemed* 
				*with perishable things* 
					*like silver or gold* 
				*from your futile way of life* 
					*inherited from your forefathers,* 
				*but with precious blood,* 
					*as of a lamb* 
						*unblemished* 
						*and spotless,* 
							*the blood of Christ.* 
*For He [Christ]*
	*was foreknown* 
		*before the foundation of the world,* 
	*but has appeared in these last times* 
		*for the sake of you* 
			*who through Him* 
			*are believers in God,* 
	*who raised Him from the dead* 
*and gave Him glory,* 
	*so that* 
		*your faith* 
		*and hope* 
		*are in God.* 
*Since you have* 
	*in obedience* 
	*to the truth* 
		*purified your souls* 
			*for a sincere love* 
				*of the brethren,* 
	*fervently love* 
		*one another* 
		*from the heart,* 
	*for you have been born again* 
		*not of seed* 
		*which is perishable* 
		*but imperishable,* 
		*that is,* 
			*through* 
				*the living* 
				*and enduring* 
				*word of God.* 
					*For, "ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS,* 
					*AND ALL ITS GLORY* 
					*LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS.* 
					*THE GRASS WITHERS,* 
					*AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF,* 
					*BUT THE WORD* 
					*OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER."* 
						*And this is the word* 
						*which was preached to you.* 

### *Title*

*Therefore,* 
		*putting aside* 
			*all malice* 
			*and all deceit* 
			*and hypocrisy* 
			*and envy* 
			*and all slander,* 
		*like newborn babies,* 
	*long for the pure milk of the word,* 
		*so that by it* 
		*you may grow in respect to salvation,* 
*if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.* 
*And coming* 
*to Him* 
	*as to a living stone* 
		*which has been rejected by men,* 
		*but is* 
			*choice* 
			*and precious* 
			*in the sight of God,* 
	*you also,* 
		*as living stones,* 
			*are being built up* 
			*as a spiritual house* 
			*for a holy priesthood,* 
		*to offer up spiritual sacrifices* 
			*acceptable to God* 
			*through Jesus Christ.* 
	*For this is contained in Scripture:* 
		*"BEHOLD,* 
		*I LAY IN ZION* 
		*A CHOICE STONE,* 
		*A PRECIOUS CORNER stone,* 
		*AND HE WHO BELIEVES IN HIM* 
		*WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."* 
*This precious value,* 
*then, is for you who believe;* 
*but for those who disbelieve,* 
		*"THE STONE* 
		*WHICH THE BUILDERS REJECTED,* 
		*THIS BECAME THE VERY CORNER stone,"* 
		*and,* 
		*"A STONE* 
		*OF STUMBLING* 
		*AND A ROCK OF OFFENSE";* 
	*for they stumble* 
		*because they are disobedient* 
			*to the word,* 
*and to this doom they were also appointed.* 
*But you are* 
	*A CHOSEN RACE,* 
	*A royal PRIESTHOOD,* 
	*A HOLY NATION,* 
	*A PEOPLE* 
	*FOR God's OWN POSSESSION,* 
*so that you may proclaim* 
*the excellencies of Him* 
	*who has called you* 
		*out of darkness* 
		*into His marvelous light;* 
	*for you once were NOT A PEOPLE,* 
		*but now you are* 
		*THE PEOPLE OF GOD;* 
	*you had NOT RECEIVED MERCY,* 
		*but now you have RECEIVED MERCY.* 

### *Exhortation*

*Beloved, I urge you* 
	*as aliens and strangers* 
*to abstain from fleshly lusts* 
	*which wage war against the soul.* 
*Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles,* 
*so that in the thing* 
*in which they slander you* 
	*as evildoers,* 
*they may* 
	*because of your good deeds,* 
	*as they observe them,* 
*glorify God in the day of visitation.* 
*Submit yourselves* 
*for the Lord's sake* 
*to every human institution,* 
	*whether to a king* 
	*as the one in authority,* 
	*or to governors as sent by him* 
*for the punishment of evildoers* 
*and the praise of those who do right.* 
*For such is the will of God* 
*that by doing right* 
*you may silence the ignorance of foolish men.* 
*Act as free men,* 
*and do not use your freedom* 
*as a covering for evil,* 
*but use it as bondslaves of God.* 
*Honor all people,* 
*love the brotherhood,* 
*fear God,* 
*honor the king.* 

#### *Servants*

*Servants,* 
*be submissive to your masters* 
*with all respect,* 
*not only to those* 
*who are good and gentle,* 
*but also to those* 
*who are unreasonable.* 
*For this finds favor,* 
*if for the sake of conscience* 
*toward God a person bears up* 
*under sorrows* 
*when suffering unjustly.* 
*For what credit is there if,* 
*when you sin and are harshly treated,* 
*you endure it with patience?* 
*But if when you do what is right* 
*and suffer for it* 
*you patiently endure it,* 
*this finds favor with God.* 
*For you have been called for this purpose,* 
*since Christ also suffered for you,* 
*leaving you an example* 
*for you to follow in His steps,* 
*WHO COMMITTED NO SIN,* 
*NOR WAS ANY DECEIT FOUND IN HIS MOUTH;* 
*and while being reviled,* 
*He did not revile in return;* 
*while suffering,* 
*He uttered no threats,* 
*but kept entrusting Himself* 
*to Him who judges righteously;*
*and He Himself* 
*bore our sins* 
*in His body* 
*on the cross,* 
*so that we might* 
*die to sin* 
*and live to righteousness;* 
*for by His wounds you were healed.* 
*For you were continually straying like sheep,* 
*but now you have returned* 
*to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.* 

#### *Wives*

*In the same way, you wives,* 
	*be submissive* 
	*to your own husbands* 
	*so that even if any of them* 
	*are disobedient to the word,* 
	*they may be won without a word* 
	*by the behavior of their wives,* 
	*as they observe* 
	*your chaste and respectful behavior.* 
	*Your adornment must not be merely external—*
		*braiding the hair,* 
		*and wearing gold jewelry,* 
		*or putting on dresses;* 
	*but let it be the hidden person of the heart,* 
	*with the imperishable quality* 
	*of a gentle* 
	*and quiet spirit,* 
	*which is precious* 
		*in the sight of God.* 
	*For in this way* 
		*in former times* 
	*the holy women also,* 
		*who hoped in God,* 
	*used to adorn themselves,* 
	*being submissive* 
		*to their own husbands;* 
		*just as Sarah obeyed Abraham,* 
			*calling him lord,* 
			*and you have become her children* 
			*if you do what is right* 
			*without being frightened by any fear.* 

#### *Husbands*

*You husbands in the same way,* 
	*live with your wives* 
	*in an understanding way,* 
	*as with someone weaker,* 
	*since she is a woman;* 
	*and show her honor* 
	*as a fellow heir of the grace of life,* 
	*so that your prayers will not be hindered.* 

#### *All of you*

*To sum up, all of you be* 
	*harmonious,* 
	*sympathetic,* 
	*brotherly,* 
	*kindhearted,* 
	*and humble in spirit;* 
	*not returning evil for evil* 
	*or insult for insult,* 
	*but giving a blessing instead;* 
	*for you were called* 
	*for the very purpose* 
	*that you might inherit a blessing.* 
	*For, "THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE,* 
	*TO LOVE AND SEE GOOD DAYS,* 
	*MUST KEEP HIS TONGUE* 
	*FROM EVIL* 
	*AND HIS LIPS* 
	*FROM SPEAKING DECEIT.* 
	*"HE MUST TURN* 
	*AWAY FROM EVIL* 
	*AND DO GOOD;* 
	*HE MUST SEEK PEACE* 
	*AND PURSUE IT.* 
	*"FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD* 
	*ARE TOWARD THE RIGHTEOUS,* 
	*AND HIS EARS ATTEND TO THEIR PRAYER,* 
	*BUT THE FACE OF THE LORD* 
	*IS AGAINST THOSE WHO DO EVIL."* 
*Who is there to harm you* 
*if you prove zealous for what is good?* 
*But even if you should suffer* 
*for the sake of righteousness,* 
*you are blessed.* 
*AND DO NOT FEAR* 
*THEIR INTIMIDATION,* 
*AND DO NOT BE TROUBLED,* 
*but sanctify Christ* 
*as Lord in your hearts,* 
*always being ready* 
*to make a defense* 
*to everyone* 
*who asks you to give an account* 
*for the hope that is in you,* 
*yet with gentleness* 
*and reverence;* 
*and keep a good conscience* 
*so that in the thing* 
*in which you are slandered,* 
*those who revile* 
*your good behavior in Christ* 
*will be put to shame.* 
*For it is better,* 
*if God should will it so,* 
*that you suffer for doing what is right* 
*rather than for doing what is wrong.* 
*For Christ also died for sins once for all,* 
*the just for the unjust,* 
*so that He might bring us to God,* 
*having been put to death in the flesh,* 
*but made alive in the spirit;* 
*in which also He went* 
*and made proclamation* 
*to the spirits now in prison,* 
*who once were disobedient,* 
*when the patience of God* 
*kept waiting in the days of Noah,* 
*during the construction of the ark,* 
*in which a few,* 
*that is, eight persons,* 
*were brought safely* 
*through the water.* 
*Corresponding to that,* 
*baptism now saves you—*
	*not the removal of dirt from the flesh,* 
*but an appeal to God for a good conscience—*
*through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,* 
	*who is at the right hand of God,* 
*having gone into heaven,* 
*after angels* 
*and authorities* 
*and powers* 
*had been subjected to Him.* 

#### *Title*

*Therefore,* 
  *since Christ has suffered* 
  	*in the flesh,* 
  	*arm yourselves also* 
  	*with the same purpose,* 
  		*because he who has suffered* 
  		*in the flesh* 
  		*has ceased from sin,* 
  	*so as to live* 
  	*the rest of the time* 
  	*in the flesh* 
  	*no longer* 
  		*for the lusts of men,* 
  		*but for the will of God.* 
  *For the time* 
  	*already past* 
  		*is sufficient* 
  			*for you* 
  			*to have carried out* 
  			*the desire* 
  			*of the Gentiles,* 
  				*having pursued* 
  				*a course of* 
    				*sensuality,* 
    				*lusts,* 
    				*drunkenness,* 
    				*carousing,* 
    				*drinking parties* 
    				*and abominable idolatries.* 
  *In all this,* 
  	*they are surprised* 
  	*that you do not run with them* 
  	*into the same excesses of dissipation,* 
  		*and they malign you;* 
  	*but they will give account to Him* 
  	*who is ready to judge* 
  		*the living* 
  		*and the dead.* 
  	*For the gospel has* 
  		*for this purpose been preached* 
  		*even to those who are dead,* 
  		*that though they are judged* 
  		*in the flesh as men,* 
  		*they may live in the spirit* 
  			*according to the will of God.* 
  			*The end of all things is near;* 

#### *Serving one another in the Spirit*

*therefore,* 
  *be* 
  	*of sound judgment* 
  	*and sober spirit* 
  	*for the purpose of prayer.* 
  *Above all,* 
  	*keep fervent* 
  		*in your love* 
  			*for one another,* 
  			*because love* 
  				*covers a multitude of sins.* 
  *Be* 
  	*hospitable* 
  		*to one another* 
  		*without complaint.* 
  	*As each one has received* 
  		*a special gift,* 
  			*employ it* 
  				*in serving one another* 
  				*as good stewards* 
  					*of the manifold grace of God.* 
  	*Whoever speaks,* 
    	*is to do so* 
  		*as one who is speaking* 
  		*the utterances of God;* 
  	*whoever serves* 
    	*is to do so* 
    	*as one* 
  			*who is serving* 
  				*by the strength* 
  				*which God supplies;* 
  					*so that in all things* 
  						*God may be glorified* 
    						*through Jesus Christ,* 
    							*to whom belongs the glory* 
    								*and dominion forever and ever.* 
    									*Amen.* 

#### *Testing*

*Beloved,* 
  *do not be surprised* 
  *at the fiery ordeal among you,* 
    *which comes* 
    	*upon you* 
    	*for your testing,* 
  *as though some strange thing were happening to you;* 
  *but to the degree* 
  	*that you share* 
  	*the sufferings of Christ,* 
  		*keep on rejoicing,* 
  		*so that also at the revelation* 
  		*of His glory* 
  		*you may rejoice* 
  		*with exultation.* 
  		*If you* 
  			*are reviled* 
  			*for the name of Christ,* 
  				*you are blessed,* 
  				*because the Spirit* 
  					*of glory* 
  					*and of God* 
  						*rests on you.* 
  *Make sure that none of you* 
  	*suffers* 
    	*as a murderer,* 
    	*or thief,* 
    	*or evildoer,* 
    	*or a troublesome meddler;* 
  	*but if anyone suffers* 
  		*as a Christian,* 
  			*he is not to be ashamed,* 
  			*but is to glorify God* 
  			*in this name.* 
  		*For it is time* 
  			*for judgment to begin* 
  				*with the household of God;* 
  				*and if it begins with us first,* 
  				*what will be the outcome for those* 
  				*who do not obey the gospel of God?* 
  			*AND IF IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY* 
  			*THAT THE RIGHTEOUS IS SAVED,* 
  			*WHAT WILL BECOME* 
  			*OF THE GODLESS MAN AND THE SINNER?* 

#### *Title*

*Therefore,* 
*those also* 
	*who suffer* 
		*according to the will of God* 
	*shall entrust their souls* 
	*to a faithful Creator* 
	*in doing what is right.* 

### *Instructions to elders* 

*Therefore,* 
*I exhort the elders* 
	*among you,* 
	*as your fellow elder* 
		*and witness* 
			*of the sufferings of Christ,* 
		*and a partaker also* 
			*of the glory* 
			*that is to be revealed,*

#### 1 Pedro 3:18 el justo por los injustos, para llevarnos a Dios, ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:18 muerto en la carne pero vivificado en el espíritu. ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:19 En el espíritu también fue y predicó a los espíritus encarcelados, ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:20 quienes en otro tiempo fueron desobedientes cuando la paciencia de Dios esperaba en los días de Noé durante la construcción del arca, ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:20 en la cual unos pocos, es decir, ocho personas, fueron salvadas ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:20 por medio del agua. ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:21 Y correspondiendo a esto, el bautismo ahora los salva a ustedes, ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:21 no quitando la suciedad de la carne, ...

#### 1 Pedro 3:21 sino como una petición a Dios de una buena conciencia, ...
