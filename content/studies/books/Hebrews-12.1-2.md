# Run with endurance 

we are to running looking to Jesus. While it is true Jesus is the end goal, we are look at how Jesus ran. 

He looked to the Joy ahead. 

He looked down at the shame he endured on the cross due to being identified in sin. 

[**Heb 6:20** ](verseid:58.6.20) where Jesus has entered as a **forerunner** for us, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
