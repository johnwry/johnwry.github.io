title: Romans 1:18-32
---

> [**Rom 1:24** ](verseid:45.1.24) Therefore God gave them over in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, so that their bodies would be dishonored among them.

### Romans 1:24b - *lusts of their hearts* - Lusts (EPITHUMIA) - strong desire. 

Mark 4:19 - The desires and cares of the world, distracted from growing in the truth.

Luke 22:15 - Jesus strongly desired to celebrate the passover before dying on the cross. 

men do not realize the cause for the strong desire and are enslaved to it. Since men exchanged the truth of God's existence (v25), they ended up following strong desires which led them to worship and serve the creature rather than the creator. 

While the strong desire cannot be identified (source), the result can. This, same as God's revelation of truth of his invisible attributes, can be clearly seen.
