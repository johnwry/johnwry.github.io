# Romans 10:9-10

[**Rom 10:8** ](verseid:45.10.8) But what does it say? "THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, IN YOUR MOUTH AND IN YOUR HEART"—that is, the word of faith which we are preaching,

[**Rom 10:9** ](verseid:45.10.9) that if you confess with your mouth Jesus *as* Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;

[**Rom 10:10** ](verseid:45.10.10) for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.

[**Rom 10:10** ](verseid:45.10.10) For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

[**Rom 10:11** ](verseid:45.10.11) For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”

[**Rom 10:12** ](verseid:45.10.12) For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.

[**Rom 10:13** ](verseid:45.10.13) For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

But what does it say?

"THE WORD IS NEAR YOU, 

IN YOUR MOUTH 

AND IN YOUR HEART"—

that is, 

the word of faith 

which we are preaching, 

that if you confess `HOMOLOGEO: Heb 13:15`

with your mouth Jesus *as* Lord, 

and believe in your heart 

that God raised Him from the dead, 

you will be saved; `SOTERIA: Mesianic Salvation, physical salvation or sanctification?`

for with the heart a person believes, 

resulting in righteousness, 

and with the mouth he confesses, `HOMOLOGEO:`

resulting in salvation. `SOTERIA: Mesianic Salvation, physical salvation or sanctification?`

For the Scripture says, 

“Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”

For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.

For, “Whoever will call 

on the name of the Lord 

will be saved.” `SOTERIA: Mesianic Salvation, physical salvation or sanctification?`
